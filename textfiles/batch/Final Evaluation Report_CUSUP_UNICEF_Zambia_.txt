Final Evaluation Report || Evaluation of Catch Up Scale Up Programme in Zambia
Executive summary
This report is prepared by the Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER) and presents the findings
of the midline evaluation of the scale up of the Catch-Up programme of remedial learning in Zambia.
Several challenges remain despite continued efforts by the Government of the Republic of Zambia to improve
the education system in the country. Learners in different grades are not learning enough, as displayed by
national and regional assessments, such as, the 2016 Grade 5 National Assessment and the Southern and Eastern
Africa Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality (SACMEQ) III). Findings from the PISA for
Development (PISA-D) study reveal that in Zambia only 5% and 2% and of the learners achieved the minimum
level of proficiency in reading and mathematics respectively. Among OECD countries on average, learners’
minimum level of performance is 80% in reading and 77% in mathematics1. Although more recent assessments
from 2018 point to a marked improvement in the learning levels of learners, such as Early Grade Reading
Assessment (EGRA) and Early Grade Mathematics Assessment (EGMA), there still remains a lot of ground to
cover. The Ministry of General Education (MoGE) has been focused on improving learning at the foundational
level, particularly at Grades 3, 4 and 5. It has partnered with USAID, UNICEF, Pratham (an Indian NGO
working in the area of education) J-PAL, TaRL Africa and VVOB to implement the Catch Up programme of
remedial learning. The programme follows Pratham’s Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL) methodology adapted
suitably to the Zambian context. Under the programme, three different approaches of TaRL were piloted before
finalising the one-hour per day model during regular school. The model was scaled up to cover 1,780 schools
in the Eastern and Southern provinces during 2017–2020.
The objective of the evaluation was to provide external, independent assessment of the Catch-Up programme
in meeting its intended objectives of remedial learning in Grades 3, 4 and 5. More specifically, the objective of
the evaluation was:
• to assess the extent to which the programme is achieving its objective of improving literacy and
numeracy skills for all learners and for those further behind;
• to assess the extent to which the programme is being implemented as designed, including effectiveness
of partnerships and sustainability mechanisms;
• to assess the sufficiency of resources to implement the Catch-Up Programme, while still maintaining
effectiveness; and
• to assess the enablers and factors contributing to the positive and negative effects, if any, of the Catch
Up programme.
The overall objective of the evaluation was to provide policymakers and stakeholders, namely MoGE, UNICEF,
USAID, TaRL Africa, J-PAL, Pratham, and The Flemish Association for Development Cooperation and
Technical Assistance (VVOB), with useful insights on the implementation of the programme, its efficacy for
improving foundational learning among the children of Zambia, the challenges encountered and the measures
taken to overcome them. The evaluation aimed to specifically investigate the effectiveness, efficiency,
relevance, sustainability and the equity aspect of the Catch-Up programme.
The duration of the evaluation was originally planned between September 2019 and May 2020. However,
because of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the evaluation period was extended to August 2021. The
extension was necessitated by several factors, such as, indefinite closure of schools, changes in the school
calendar, and disruptions in the Catch-Up classes owing to the closure of schools.2 The data collection was
further delayed because a minimum number of weeks of Catch-Up classes needed to be conducted before
assessing the learning outcomes of learners. The disruption in Catch-Up classes due to the pandemic may have

2 All schools closed due to COVID 19 on 18th March, 2020. Examination classes reopened on 1st June, 2020. Non
examination classes reopened on 21st September, 2020. All schools closed for the last term in December, 2020. For the
academic year 2021, the reopening of schools was delayed by 2 weeks in January 2021. Instead of opening from 18th
January the schools started from 1st February, 2021. Schools closed on 17th June 2021 for an initial 21 days and then
reopened again on 23rd August, 2021.

a bearing on the findings pertaining to the assessment of students and hence need to be considered with caution.
Furthermore, the COVID-19 protocols posed some challenges in the field in terms of the availability of adequate
number of respondents in a few instances. The timing of the data collection (February–March 2021) was also
not ideal as 8 schools out of 35 could not be reached because of flooding. To mitigate such challenges, schools
and respondents were replaced as and when necessary.
The evaluation was managed by a team from UNICEF and the MoGE. Technical support was provided by a
reference group comprising of members from UNICEF, USAID, MoGE and VVOB. The evaluation focuses on
outcomes obtained by the programme interventions after 20 months of implementation since its initiation.
Methodology
The evaluation followed a theory based approach in line with the requirements of the ToR. A theory of change
for the Catch Up programme (see Figure 1) informed key evaluation questions, and the methodology was
aligned to the evaluation questions. The evaluation relied mostly on primary research with secondary research
only being used to develop the tools and to prepare the background of the report.
The scale up of the Catch-Up programme covered
The Catch-Up programme districts were selected by
1,780 schools during 2017–2020.3 However, the
MoGE on the basis of a set of indicators reflecting
evaluation was conducted on a purposively chosen
poverty levels and learning outcomes in English and
sample of three districts from each province, Eastern
Math. Schools in each district were chosen by the
and Southern. Thus, Chipata, Katete and Mambwe District Education Boards (DEBs), using pre-agreed
were selected from the Eastern province, and criteria. These included:
Monze, Zimba and Kazungula were selected from
• performance levels (to enable diversity in
the Southern province. learning levels);
A total of 35 schools were selected from the six • geographical considerations (to include both
rural and peri-urban);
districts in the two provinces. From the 35 schools,
1,053 learners, 96 teachers, 31 monitors and 34 head • grade offering (G1–G7 only);
teachers were interviewed. In addition, 25 Zonal In- • school running agency (both Government and
Service Coordinators (ZICs), 6 District Resource community); and
Centre Coordinators (DRCCs) and 2 Provincial • clustering of schools into Zones (around 5

interviewed. Furthermore, at national level
representatives of MoGE, UNICEF, USAID, VVOB, TaRL Africa, J-PAL and Pratham were also interviewed
to get a perspective of the programme planners, technical assistance providers and implementers.
The data collection team was trained through a three-day session involving classroom lectures, role plays,
question and answer sessions, and finally the field-testing of tools. Owing to the travel restrictions, the Team
Leader trained the enumerators and supervisors online using the Microsoft Teams platform. The training on
TaRL assessment methods and tools was conducted in a one-day face to face session by representatives of
MoGE in both the provinces.
Following the data collection, the data was analysed using quantitative and qualitative methods of analysis.
Key findings
Key findings from the evaluation have been summarised against the criteria of effectiveness, efficiency,
relevance, sustainability and equity.
Effectiveness
Effectiveness of the programme was measured against parameters, such as literacy and numeracy outcomes of
learners, effectiveness of training on the TaRL methodology, proportion of teachers finding the TaRL

methodology useful in eliminating learning difficulties among learners, and challenges faced in implementing
the programme. 92 % of the survey respondents agreed that the remedial teaching activities of the Catch-Up
programme generated interest among the teachers and learners.
The literacy assessment does not show much variation in the proportion of learners among the levels from
baseline to midline assessment, except at the beginner level. There is a 19% increase in the proportion of learners
who cannot identify even a single letter. When queried, most teachers attributed this to the disruption in regular
school and Catch Up activities owing to COVID-19. Irregular Catch-Up classes resulted in learning losses as
the learners found it difficult to retain their learnings over extended periods of break in the school calendar.
In numeracy, the assessment results show that 85% of the learners can recognise numbers of two or more digits,
showing that they were ready to start with numerical operations. However, there continues to be a large group
of learners who are not able to do basic mathematical operations of addition and subtraction. This group reduces
in size as the learners’ progress across levels. Changes between baseline and midline assessment data shows
that there has been a distinct increase in proportion of learners attaining higher levels in mathematics with both
the Southern and Eastern provinces reporting an 18% and 17% increase in the proportion of learners respectively
who could do division and multiplication.
As far as the training on TaRL methodology is concerned, all 96 teachers who were interviewed reported having
received the training. 98% of the teachers found the training to be useful which introduces the use of 6 different
teaching methodologies that helps reduce learning difficulties among learners. 82% of the teachers stated that
the Catch-Up programme was implemented effectively as per schedule. Effective implementation of the
programme was attributed to complete ownership of the programme by MoGE and training and mentoring
provided by UNICEF, VVOB and other partners.
Some of the key challenges in implementing the programme, as reported by teachers and other stakeholders,
were large teacher learner ratio, poor quality of teachers in some instances, limited funds for travel for reporting
purposes, lack of infrastructure, and the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Efficiency
The programme was perceived to be implemented in a cost-effective manner and 65% of the teachers, Head
Teachers, and MoGE staff reported that the classes were held as per schedule. The primary reason for the
programme being cost effective, as reported by the school administration and MoGE, was that the TaRL
methodology was least resource intensive and most of the material required to conduct the classes was available
within the school. The training and mentoring support were frequent, and the summary reports were perceived
to be useful by 89% of the respondents. However, in terms of the sufficiency of resources, there is a gap in
understanding between programme participants and stakeholders. While all school administrations reported that
the resources were sufficient, 35% teachers stated that more resources were required, such as reading material
for higher levels. The stakeholders’ perception was that the programme did not require much resources but the
implementers suggested that there is a need for more resources, particularly as learners reach higher levels of
achievement.
Relevance
The programme was perceived to be extremely relevant to the Zambian context by an overwhelming 98% of
the stakeholders. The programme is perceived to be extremely important in achieving foundational literacy and
numeracy by the teachers, school administrators, MoGE as well as USAID, UNICEF, TaRL Africa, Pratham
and VVOB. The overall goals of the programme are perceived to be in line with the strategic priorities of MoGE.
Finally, stakeholder participation in terms of providing feedback is quite high and the feedback provided is
regular and perceived to have been taken on board.
Sustainability
67% of the stakeholders reported the programme to be sustainable. The engagement of MoGE with the
programme is quite high. Officials in the system are incorporated into the programme as monitors and trainers.
Furthermore, there is buy-in from the Government on incorporating the programme into the education system
and scaling it up nationally. Sufficient capacity and confidence are perceived to have been built up so that the

programme can be continued without external support. However, teachers have pointed out that support from
the system in specific areas, such as training, mentoring, etc. is important for continued successful
implementation of the programme.
Equity
There is a varied perception among respondents on whether gender plays a role in retention or continuation of
education across provinces. Most of the respondents suggested that the Catch Up programme has similar impact
on both male and female learners. At the school and systemic level, MoGE makes every effort to respond to the
learning needs of girls and vulnerable children. For learners with disabilities, accommodations are made at
teacher level, however, owing to the paucity of data on disabilities, the programme planners and implementers
reported difficulty in bringing such learners within the ambit of the programme.
Key Recommendations
• Disparities in terms of expectations of teachers regarding the programme support through mentoring were
witnessed in the two regions. Going forward, the Ministry of Education (MoE) needs to ensure that Catch-
Up and similar other remedial learning programmes holds consistency in the implementation and
monitoring and mentoring across the provinces.
• It is recommended that the Catch-up methodology be integrated into the in-service teachers training system
and implemented nation-wide to improve foundational learning for Zambian children. A useful approach
to ensure the sustainability of Catch-Up training sessions would be to include them in the existing School-
Based Continuing Professional Development (SBCPD) or School Programme of In-service Training for
the Term (SPRINT).
• Creative and innovative aspects of the Catch-Up methodology reportedly generated the greatest interest
among learners. A teachers’ learning platform may be created where teachers share their innovative ideas
and learn from each other’s practices and utilise new teaching methods in their Catch-Up and mainstream
classes.
• If MoE plans to institutionalise the programme and implement it at the national level, it is important for
the Ministry to secure funding for activities.
• To implement the Catch-Up programme better, it is recommended that participating teachers be duly
recognized and kept motivated. Cost effective ways of recognition, such as, certificates of appreciation and
other non-monetary incentives would go a long way in sustaining the sense of pride among the teachers.
• Some teachers indicated the high pupil teacher ratio (PTR) as one of the challenges in the effective
implementation of Catch-Up programme. Recruitment of teachers coupled with their deployment as per
the needs of the school needs to be considered. Further, a mapping of teachers may be useful to identify
schools with excess teachers. These teachers may then be deployed to schools facing a shortage of teachers.
Lessons learned
• One of the key lessons from the programme has been the positive impact of the continued involvement
of MoGE in Catch-Up activities. The buy in by the ministry across the various levels has led to its
smooth implementation. The joint planning of the programme by the ministry with all stakeholders and
its “doing with” rather than “doing for” approach has truly institutionalised the programme. It has built
a sense of ownership among the teachers, head teachers, as well as, the MoGE staff across zones,
districts and provinces which in turn has translated into consistently improved performance of learners,
barring the current year, where the learning activities were severely impacted by the pandemic.
• Strong communication ties between MoGE, UNICEF, USAID, TaRL Africa, J-PAL, Pratham and
VVOB has ensured quick decision making, feedback to teachers, trainers, and monitors, thereby
ensuring the quality of the programme.

• Prompt response to the changing environment was one of the key lessons learned from the programme.
Since early 2020, amid the COVID19 pandemic, the programme partners quickly changed some of the
core activities by conducting them online rather than in the face to face mode. Most of physical meetings
were replaced by virtual ones. Orientations and trainings were organised in online mode.

Chapter 1. Background and programme description
1.1. Introduction
This report presents the midline findings of the scale up of the Catch-Up Programme in Zambia. The evaluation
period, from September 2019 to August 2021, was conducted by an independent international team led by the
Australian Council for Educational Research. It would be pertinent to mention here that the original end date of
the evaluation period was May 2020. However, owing to factors beyond the control of the evaluation team and
later due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the evaluation was delayed and data collection was done between
February and March 2021. The delay posed some challenges to the data collection team in finding an adequate
number of respondents in some instances. In these cases, the team had to collect data from replacement schools,
as the originally sampled schools were either closed or inaccessible due to floods on the day of data collection.
Details of such instances have been mentioned in the sections on sampling and limitations of the study. The
results of the literacy and numeracy assessment need to be interpreted with caution as the learners had to be
tested after only about three weeks of Catch Up classes. Previous assessments prove that when learners
undertake Catch-Up classes over a sustained period, remarkable improvements are observed in their
performance.4
The evaluation was managed by a team from UNICEF and the MoGE with technical support provided by a
reference group comprising of members from UNICEF, USAID, MoGE, and VVOB. The evaluation focuses
on outcomes obtained by the programme interventions after 20 months of implementation.
This report consists of nine chapters including annexes. This first chapter provides the background to the
evaluation and is followed by chapters two and three that present the evaluation purpose, objectives and scope.

1.2. Social and economic situation in Zambia
Zambia is a landlocked country located in the interior plateau of Southern Africa, with an estimated population
of 18.4 million in 2020 covering 752,614 square kilometres.5 It is a member of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) regional grouping. Zambia has enjoyed a period of stable political
environment and good internal security since its independence in 1964, in contrast to most of the countries it
borders.6
Following a successful economy growth of about 6.8 % GDP between 2000 and 2014, the country achieved
middle income status in 2011. However, Zambia’s economic performance has stalled in the recent years,
because of falling copper prices and declines in agricultural output and hydro-electric power generation because
of insufficient rains. This caused the GDP growth rate to drop to 3.1 % per annum between 2015 and 2019. The
COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the macroeconomic vulnerabilities in Zambia. In 2019, economic growth
declined significantly, from 4 % (2018) to 1.7 %.7 The level of poverty remains high with 54.4 % of the
population living below the national poverty line (76.6 % in rural areas and 23.4 % in urban areas) and 40.8 %
living in extreme poverty (60.8 % in rural areas and 12.8 % in urban areas).8 The Human Development Index
is 143 out of 189 countries.9

Extreme poverty is prevalent in Zambia, particularly in rural areas. Children, adolescents, young persons and
women comprise the most vulnerable groups who experience greater burdens from inequalities. The strategic
focus of the Government is to address low levels of employment, invest in rural development and reduce
widening inequalities. In its national planning, the Government utilises several strategies to achieve
socioeconomic transformation for a “prosperous middle-income” Zambia. For example, the Public Service
Transformation Programme aims to make the public service more responsive, service-oriented and accountable
in the delivery of timely and quality services. The Government’s plan to operationalise the Industrial
Development Commission aims to accelerate the process of the transformation of the economy through optimal
use of resources. In the context of sustainable development, socioeconomic transformation means not only
achieving social change and a strong economy, but also building resilient and empowered human capital, a
prerequisite for effective democracy. Inclusive economic growth requires a healthy and educated population
with the requisite skills to take advantage of opportunities in an ever more interconnected global economic
environment. Furthermore, an educated and empowered population is the backbone of any democratic system.11

1.3. Status of education in Zambia
At international level, Zambia is a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child
(UNCRC), Education for All (EFA) goals, the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and
more recently, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Zambia’s 1996 National Policy on Education explicitly mentions establishing new partnerships with all
education providers, non-governmental organisations, local communities and religious groups to enhance the
educational outreach to the youth of Zambia. Towards this end, Zambia now has four types of schools in the
country namely Government, Grant aided, Private/Church and Community schools.12 The jobs diagnostics in
Zambia working paper shows that youth with skills, as represented by education level, are more likely to benefit
from the economic transformation underway in Zambia.13 The report puts education at the centre stage of
Zambia’s the economic transformation.
Since 1996, Zambia has achieved near universal primary school completion levels—national statistics indicate
a completion rate of 91.8 % at Grade 7. But this masks considerable regional disparities, with the northern
region recording 81.3 % (72 % for female learners) and Lusaka a rate of 78.6 %. For children in the early years,
the coverage of care, learning and education services remains persistently low. Overall, girls continue to be at a
disadvantage with a large number of them dropping out in the upper primary and secondary grades, and poorer
levels of transition to junior secondary and senior secondary levels.14
Transition rates from primary to secondary school are low at 67.5 %. This is mainly due to the following factors:
• lack of places to accommodate all primary school graduates;
• introduction of school fees in Grade 8;
• distance to schools; and
• other costs related to education (such as the cost of not otherwise contributing to household income)
For girls at secondary level, there are also additional barriers pertaining to the lack of menstrual hygiene
facilities, the low value placed by some communities on girls’ receiving a secondary education, teenage
pregnancy and child marriage.
On the quality aspect, national assessments show increased levels of learning. However, challenges remain to
meet the target of an average score of 40 % in language and mathematics in Grades 5 and 9. The proportion of
children completing Grades 9 and 12 continue to remain low.

Analysing the Education Sector Public Expenditure in Zambia, the World Bank found that while the quantitative
indicators of education sector have improved, the learning outcomes have been persistently low.17
Despite successful expansion of access to education, Zambia has some of the lowest academic achievements as
measured by standardised national and regional testing.18 Previous national assessment (2016 Grade Five
National Assessment) showed that pupils’ scores are below the 40th percentile (34.90 % in reading in English
and 36.98 % in mathematics) which was established by the Ministry of Education as the minimum performance
standard at that time.19
The Southern and Eastern Africa Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality (SACMEQ) II and III
assessments show that the performance of Zambian learners is unsatisfactory and much lower than most of the
other countries in this region. In SACMEQ II, Zambia was 13th out of 14 countries in reading and 12th in
mathematics.20 These results were even worse in the subsequent round of assessment SACMEQ III, when
Zambia was 14th out of 15 countries in reading and 15th in mathematics.21
Zambia’s learners demonstrated an average score of 440.1 in reading and 435.2 in mathematics
in the SACMEQ II assessment, which is below the regional mean of 500 of all countries that participated in this
assessment in the region.22 The same trend is observed in SACMEQ III assessment results.
The reading mean score for boys in SACMEQ III was 437.1 and is lower than the score of 439.8 in SACMEQ
II. The reading mean score for girls in SACMEQ III was 431.5 compared to 440.7 score reported in SACMEQ
II. Both boys and girls had mean scores lower than the overall SACMEQ II mean score of 500 and the SACMEQ
III mean score of 512 for reading and 509.7 for mathematics.23Findings from the PISA for Development (PISA-
D) study reveal that in Zambia only 5% and 2% and of the learners achieved the minimum level of proficiency
in reading and mathematics respectively. Among OECD countries on average, learners’ minimum level of
performance is 80% in reading and 77% in mathematics24.
Even at the early grade level, assessments have
shown that a substantial proportion of School closures due to COVID-19 has resulted in

Despite this, learners are still below par, and many children go through the system without the necessary literacy
and numeracy skills to allow them access to most of the school curricula. Many learners, particularly girls drop-
out due to limited support. While infrastructure gaps in education remain a cause for concern, the World Bank
Public Expenditure Review (PER) of the education sector identifies two factors in addition to the shortage of
classrooms that account for the consistently low learning outcomes – lack of textbooks and lack of feedback
loops between learners’ learning performances and the sector inputs directly related to learners’ learning
achievements, such as teachers’ professional development programmes. The PER also reports that transition to
lower and upper secondary education is constrained by a serious shortage of seats in secondary school.27
However, in spite of these challenges, the MoGE has been striving to bring holistic development in education,
with a continued focus on improving learning outcomes, particularly at the foundational level of Grades 3, 4
and 5. Over the years, UNICEF has been supporting the Government of Zambia in achieving the education
outcomes defined in the country programme document (CPD) for Zambia. One of the outcomes stated in the
CPD is that the boys and girls of school-going age demonstrate improved learning outcomes as a result of
equitable and inclusive access to quality education by 2020. In 2015, J-PAL and Pratham approached MoGE to
consider Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL) as a method of remedial learning, a method based on evidence
from India. This was during technical meetings that were held between UNICEF, DFID and various stakeholders
who were looking into improving literacy and numeracy programming following the revised curriculum in
2014.
TaRL is premised on research that shows learners learn better when they are assessed, grouped and taught
according to their ability and not according to their grade level. This approach ensures that learners are taught
at the level of their ability. The learners are first assessed to determine their level of ability after which they are
then grouped according to their ability levels rather than grade level or age for a targeted period. This targeted
time will enable the learners to access instruction in literacy and numeracy skills according to their level of
ability. With teaching targeted to learners’ abilities, appropriate materials for each ability level, specific training
for teachers and adequate supportive monitoring mechanisms in place, the evidence of the success of these
programmes is strong and indicates that such programmes allow children to catch up and progress in their
education, having broken through to literacy and numeracy. A number of countries, including India and Ghana,
have experienced marked positive gains in student learning outcomes through similar teaching-at-level
programmes. These countries have been supported in this teaching methodology by Pratham, an India-based
organisation.
1.4. Pratham’s Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL) approach
Pratham’s Teaching at the Right Level approach was adopted to tackle the huge learning deficits observed
among early grade children in India. Despite the remarkable progress made in enrolment in primary schools,
the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) showed year on year gaps in learning outcomes of children in
Grades 3 to 5. The ASER reports also showed that the children who missed the learning opportunity in junior
grades would ultimately fail to recover once they advanced to higher grades and would ultimately find it difficult
to cope with the curriculum. In order to remedy the situation, Pratham developed the idea of teaching at the
right level.
Pratham’s techniques for enabling children to acquire basic skills in reading and arithmetic have evolved
considerably over the last decade. For over ten years, the focus has been on children who are in Grades 3 to 5
(or of that age). These children have been in school for some years but have not acquired the foundational skills
that are essential for moving ahead. There are several core elements of the method that Pratham uses. One,
learning goals are clearly articulated so that teachers and parents know what is to be achieved. Two, simple
assessment is used at the beginning of the programme. This is done both to understand the level of individual
children and of the group; the data is also used for grouping children for instruction. Later in the programme,
similar assessments are used to track children’s progress and for making course corrections. Third, for
instruction, children are grouped by level rather than by grade. Fourth, the method relies on a set of combined
daily activities to maximise learning; for example, for building numeracy knowledge and operations in
arithmetic, children will do tasks that require them to listen, speak, do, read and write. Children do activities in
27 Education Public Expenditure Review in Zambia, The World Bank, 2016

Final Evaluation Report || Evaluation of Catch Up Scale Up Programme in Zambia
big groups, in smaller groups and individually. Fifth, appropriate teaching-learning materials are developed for
the programme, which are used for each group and their respective activities.28
This methodology has been implemented by Pratham in India in three major ways. Firstly, it is a volunteer-
based model that was common in earlier iterations of TaRL. Secondly, Pratham team members lead the work
(assisted by volunteers) and demonstrate that a significant change in basic learning is possible in a relatively
short period of time. This “direct” work takes the form of “Learning Camps” and is widely used currently by
Pratham teams in locations across India. Finally, Pratham partners with government school systems where
Pratham teams work closely with government teams to incorporate Pratham’s techniques for teaching-learning,
assessments and Pratham’s materials in primary school teaching.
In the last few years, Pratham’s partnership programmes with governments, have usually had the following
characteristics:
• Learning goals: Clear articulation of learning goals to be achieved in a specific time duration.
• Simple Assessment: Use of simple assessment to understand the baseline situation. Often the
assessment feeds into the instructional design and leads to the organisation of groups for learning. In
some states, the Pratham/ASER assessment tools were used directly. In other cases, the tools are
modified with inputs from the local government. In all cases, one-on-one assessment of children’s
reading ability is part of the assessment.
• Cluster resource teams from the government: Usually, the “cluster” level cadre within the
government system is trained first. They often do 10–20 days of actual practice teaching using the
methods they have learned in Pratham training. Once this phase is completed, the cluster resource
people will train the teachers in their charge (Pratham team members assist). Creating this academic
leadership team within the government is crucial for the successful roll out of the programme.
• Appropriate teaching-learning materials: The materials that Pratham has developed for use in the
direct programmes are shared with the government. These are then printed by the government school
system and distributed in their schools. This cost is borne by government.
• Teacher training: Teachers are trained in the Pratham methods. Government officials (especially the
cluster-level government teams who have themselves been trained and have conducted “practice”
classes) conduct the training of teachers. Pratham team members assist in these trainings, wherever
possible. The government pays for the entire cost of teacher training. The first round of training at the
start of the programme usually lasts four days. Refresher trainings and review meetings are done
periodically through the course of the programme.
• Time for basic learning: As part of the learning improvement programme, time is set aside during the
school day to carry out the activities to improve basic learning. This feature of the programme is jointly
discussed and decided at the initial stages of designing the programme. Usually, it is one hour for
reading and one hour for arithmetic. For that period, “normal” curriculum/teaching-learning activities
are not done. Focus is on building foundational skills.
• Grouping by level not grade: For instructional purposes, children of Grades 3, 4 and 5 are grouped by
level and not by grade. The grouping is done based on the initial baseline assessment. As children
progress, they move into higher groups. During the “special period”, teachers who usually teach these
grades are assigned to groups instead of to grades. Depending on the availability of government teachers
in the school, two or more groups for instruction are formed.
• Monitoring and mentoring: The cluster resource persons (government staff at the cluster level) and
Pratham team members move from school to school to support the teachers in conducting specific
28 Pratham’s Models for Implementing Teaching at the Right Level, July 2017

Final Evaluation Report || Evaluation of Catch Up Scale Up Programme in Zambia
activities. Since cluster coordinators are government employees, all the additional costs are borne by
the government.
• Tracking of progress: Periodic assessment is done by teachers at different points in the joint
programme. In many cases, Pratham helps by analysing data and providing feedback to the different
levels of decision-makers in the government school system.
• Memorandum of understanding: In most cases, a formal document such as a memorandum of
understanding is signed by the government department and Pratham to begin the intervention.
The partnership with government schools’ model has been suitably adapted within the Zambian context for the
Catch-Up programme.
1.5. Catch-Up programme pilot
The Zambia Ministry of General Education piloted the Catch-Up programme in November 2016. The pilot
targeted all learners in Grades 3 to 5 in 80 selected schools over a period of one month in Eastern Province (using
intensive methods) in 2016 and for a period of six months in Southern Province (using one hour a day method) in 2017.
The districts covered under the pilot were Monze and Pemba from Southern Province and Katete and Chipata from
Eastern Province.
The Ministry piloted three models under the Catch-Up programme based on the Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL)
pedagogical approach, which aims to improve the basic literacy and numeracy skills of primary school pupils by
grouping them according to ability and providing them with instruction tailored to their learning level.
The three models followed during the pilot were:
• Intensive one-month during term time: In Chipata, selected schools regrouped pupils in Grade 3 to
5 by reading and numerical ability for an entire month. Learners were taught for three hours a day for
20 days during term time. All learning focused on teaching numeracy and literacy skills.
• Intensive one-month during school holidays: Katete followed the same approach of grouping the learners,
however, they were taught for three hours a day for 20 days during the school holidays.
• One hour a day: In Monze and Pemba, schools regrouped pupils by ability rather than grade for a concentrated
one hour of literacy teaching during one school term, and a mix of literacy and numeracy teaching in the next
school term (alternating days for over 100 days, either before or after normal classes).29
J-PAL and Pratham provided the technical assistance to MoGE in designing the Catch-Up pilot and continued
technical support to the scale up. UNICEF supported the pilot and engaged VVOB to support the capacity
building of MoGE staff in the TaRL methodology and data analysis and utilisation. UNICEF engaged IPA to
undertake a process evaluation. DFID (through ZESSTA) was responsible for material development. VVOB,
contracted by UNICEF, played the role of the implementing partner during the pilot. Later, J-PAL contracted
VVOB to implement the scale up of the programme. A key component of the pilot was the monitoring of the
implementation and an understanding of what works and why. The pilot proved to be a success with remarkable
improvements in learning levels of the learners, resulting in the MoGE deciding to scale up the programme and
introduce it in all districts of the Eastern and Southern provinces.30
1.6. Scale up of the Catch-Up programme
After successful completion of the pilot, the MoGE, in consultation with key stakeholders at the district, zone
and school level, identified its preferred model of the Catch-Up approach: for one hour during the school day
for two terms, teachers regrouped children based on performance instead of age or grade and focused on basic
literacy and numeracy skills. This approach was scaled up to 1,780 schools from 2017 to 2020. USAID and J-

PAL in partnership with VVOB and UNICEF continue to provide technical assistance to the programme in the
scale-up phase. USAID through its Development Innovation Ventures (DIV) provided funds to UNICEF and J-
PAL to help support the scale up. VVOB was re-engaged, but under J-PAL, as a capacity developer of
government staff at zonal, district and provincial level to ensure the Catch-Up approach is infused in the regular
activities of both schools and the MoGE. The total budget for the scale up was USD 5 Million. The objectives
of the programme align well with SDG 4, which aims at ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and
promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.
1.7. Monitoring structure of Zambian schools31
The institutional arrangement made by MoGE for the scale up follows a cascading model with the Ministry at the top,
followed by provincial, district and zonal levels. The capacity building of teachers for scale up is based on the Continuing
Professional Development (CPD) framework through School Program of In-service Training for the Term (SPRINT).
The monitoring structure of Zambian schools is as follows:
Ministry of General Education (MoGE)
MoGE is responsible for overall guidance to and supervision of the
Catch Up programme's scale up
Provincial Resource Centre Coordinators (1:+-1000 schools)
PRCCs coordinate districts and devise teacher support strategies.
District Resource Centre Coordinators (1: +-100 Schools)
DRCCs provide mentoring and teacher training to schools in the
district.
Zonal In-service Coordinators (1: +-10 Schools)
ZICs provide a cluster of schools with monitoring and mentoring
support.
Senior Teacher (1:1 School)
Senior Teachers provide a mentoring role in schools
By the end of the first phase of the Catch-Up programme in 2020, it is expected that learning levels of the
learners in Grades 3 to 5 in the Eastern and Southern provinces would have significantly improved, with a 50
% decrease in the number of learners in the beginner group in literacy (e.g. learners not able to recognise letters)
and a 50 % increase in the number of learners able to do basic operations (e.g. addition and subtraction for at
least two digits).32 Furthermore, at the institutional level, it is expected that during the programme and by the
end of the programme:
Zonal in-service coordinators (ZIC):
• will support schools in their zone on the TaRL approach, including the use of locally available
learning materials; and
• will strengthen the skills of school coordinators on coaching and mentoring, to further help teachers
to improve their pedagogical skills using TaRL methodology.
District coordinators (DC):
• will have improved management, facilitation, coaching and mentoring skills for the proper
implementation of the project and monitoring of schools’ results;

Chapter 3. Evaluation objectives and scope
3.1. Objective
The objective of the evaluation was to provide external, independent assessment of the extent to which the
Catch-Up programme is meeting its intended objectives. The overall objective of the evaluation was to provide
policymakers and stakeholders with useful insights into the implementation of the programme, its efficacy for
improving foundational learning among the children of Zambia, the challenges encountered, and measures taken
to overcome them. The evaluation aimed to specifically investigate the effectiveness, efficiency, relevance,
sustainability and the equity aspect of the Catch-Up programme. The criteria of effectiveness and equity align
well with the SDG 4, which aims at ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong
learning opportunities for all. In addition, the design of the evaluation has incorporated a clear human rights,
equity and gender perspective.
The specific objectives of the evaluation, as specified in the TOR were:33
• To assess the extent to which the programme is achieving its objective of improving literacy and
numeracy skills for all learners and for those further behind.
• To assess the extent to which the programme is being implemented as designed, including effectiveness
of partnerships and sustainability mechanisms.
• To assess the sufficiency of resources to implement the Catch-Up Programme, while still maintaining
effectiveness.
• To assess the enablers and factors contributing to the positive and negative effects, if any, of the Catch-
Up programme.
3.2. Scope
The scale up of the Catch-Up programme covered 1,780 schools between 2017 and 2020.34 However, the
evaluation was conducted on a purposively chosen sample of six districts, three each from the Eastern and
Southern provinces: Monze, Zimba and Kazungula were selected from the Southern province, and from the
Eastern province, Chipata, Katete and Mambwe were selected. The respondents for the evaluation were drawn
from both, the demand as well as, the supply side. The thematic scope of the evaluation, as mentioned above,
covered the criteria of effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, sustainability and equity.
It would be apt to mention here that for implementation purpose, the programme districts were selected by
MoGE based on a set of agreed indicators reflecting poverty levels and learning outcomes in English and Math.
Schools in each district were chosen by the District Education Boards (DEBs), using pre-agreed criteria. These
included:
• performance levels (to enable a widespread of learning levels);
• geographical considerations (to include both rural and peri-urban);
• grade offering (G1-G7 only);
• school running agency (both Government and community); and
• clustering of schools into Zones (around 5 schools per zone).
For the purpose of the evaluation, after deciding the sample size based on a convenience sampling approach,
schools and respondents were selected by simple random sampling. Details pertaining to the process of selection
are elaborated in the section on sampling.

Chapter 4. Evaluation methodology
4.1. Approach
The evaluation followed a theory-based approach in line with the requirements of the ToR. Given that the
project is still in the scale up phase, a credible baseline for comparison cannot be established at this time.
Comparisons on the other hand may only be made once the entire scale up has completed. A theory of change
(ToC) for the TaRL methodology is available.
The ToC is based on the premise that some learners have low levels of numeracy and literacy skills and that
with focused efforts using the TaRL methodology, they can quickly catch up with their peers. The theory
includes inputs on training and monitoring support to the Catch-up teachers and provisioning of material related
to the TaRL methodology. Continued mentoring and monitoring leads to effective implementation of the
remedial learning programme and a net impact of learners improving their basic literacy and numeracy skills.
Based on the theory of change, key evaluation questions were designed, and the methodology was aligned to
the evaluation questions.

The overall approach was as follows:
In order to meet the objectives of the evaluation, ACER India followed a three-pronged approach to the project:
1. Exploratory: ACER India’s approach to the evaluation was of an exploratory nature. The project team
deep dived into the available secondary information as well as the information derived through key
informant interviews (KIIs) to unravel findings that answered the key evaluation questions.
Page 26 of 146
ACER © 2021 Commercial in Confidence
Final Evaluation Report || Evaluation of Catch Up Scale Up Programme in Zambia
2. Mixed methods: While conducting the evaluation, the team followed a mixed methods approach
entailing secondary literature review and primary data collection from pre-identified respondents.
3. Participatory and consultative: It has been experienced that the primary research becomes drab and
does not yield the desired results if the interviews are conducted in an impersonal manner through
question-and-answer sessions. On the other hand, a consultative and participatory approach towards
interviews helps in eliciting the best and most informative responses. Accordingly, the project team
constantly endeavoured to engage with the respondents. The interviews were discussions rather than
monologues.
The overall approach to the research was a logical sequence of activities, where the outcome of one activity
formed the inputs for the next activity until the results of the research were achieved. Each of these activities
were divided into distinct phases.
The Preparatory Phase, where the evaluation methodology was finalized in consultation with UNICEF,
including the evaluation reference group and the Ministry of General Education. The inception report was
reviewed by other stakeholders, as well as the regional office of UNICEF (ESARO).
The inception phase was followed by the Implementation Phase comprising Secondary Literature Review and
Primary Research.
The third and final phase was the Finalisation Phase, wherein the findings from the field were consolidated
into an evaluation report.
4.2. Methodology
As stated above, the evaluation methodology followed several sequential steps. These steps have been
summarised below:
a. A review of the Catch-Up programme documentation and implementation data
The evaluation team reviewed all available documents relevant to the scale up of the programme design,
planning, management and implementation. This includes documents related to education sector policies and
legislations, financial reports, process monitoring reports, teacher training documents, mentoring and
monitoring process of the teachers, teacher-led model of implementation along with a review of the Catch-Up
assessment instrument and the expected learning outcomes.
The desk review provided useful insights into how each component of the programme, mainly inputs, activities
and outcomes, was designed and managed for a scale up to 1,780 schools vis-a-vis its intended objectives. 35
This helped the evaluation team understand the cause-and-effect relationship of the various components of the
scale up programme.
b. An assessment of student learning outcomes in literacy and numeracy for Grades 3, 4 and 5
The enumerators and supervisors were trained in using the assessment tool designed by Pratham to accurately
and reliably measure student learning outcomes for Grades 3, 4 and 5. Student assessment and data collection
complied with the field operations procedure as outlined in the programme implementation process. The
analysis served to cross-validate existing reports and data to ascertain accuracy and inform further scaling up of
the programme.
c. Independent classroom observations to understand the effectiveness of the programme
Teacher student interaction in the classroom is a key element that determines overall delivery and effective
implementation of an educational programme. The mode of lesson delivery and compliance with the principles
of Catch-Up were observed and noted by the data collection team. The observation focused on aspects of
classroom instruction and pedagogy, student participation, teaching resources and their relevance to the target
cohort. Teacher and student attendance sheets and the number of lesson plans were also reviewed.

Final Evaluation Report || Evaluation of Catch Up Scale Up Programme in Zambia
d. Survey of teachers and programme monitors
Classroom observations were complemented with a teacher questionnaire seeking teachers’ reflection on their
practices and the implementation process and provided evidence of effectiveness of the programme with the
associated bottlenecks. Monitors’ feedbacks were noted as useful insights into programme implementation.
e. Interviews with various stakeholders
In-depth interviews were conducted with a wide range of stakeholders involving teachers, MoGE, UNICEF,
VVOB, JPAL and USAID. All discussions with the stakeholders were recorded to inform the evaluation.
f. Sampling
To execute this assignment, a sample of districts from within the Southern and Eastern provinces was selected.
Thus, Monze, Zimba and Kazungula districts were selected from the Southern province and Chipata, Katete and
Mambwe were selected from the Eastern province based on the maximum number of Catch-Up schools being
from these districts. A total of 35 schools spread across the two provinces were included in the sample, which
worked out to approximately 10 % of the Catch-Up schools in the six districts.
For the next stage of sampling, that is, selection of schools, systematic random sampling approach was followed
in the six districts. The schools were listed as per rural and urban and randomly selected. Ten learners from
Grades 3, 4 and 5 were randomly selected. The sample distribution across the schools in their proximity was as
follows:

*In some cases, the actual sample was not achieved, as the schools were inaccessible due to flooding in
Kazungula and Monze districts and due to the unavailability of sufficient number of respondents in Chipata
district when the evaluation was conducted. In Monze, 2 out of 8 schools could not be reached due to floods in
the area and the poor road network caused by the the rains. Therefore, the DEBs suggested to replace the two
schools namely; Nyimba Primary and Kaloba primary with Nteme primary and Kaumuzya west primary
respectively. In Kazungula, Chooma River and Zalu Primary schools were replaced because they were
inaccessible at the time when the evaluation was conducted, to get there the team needed to cross three rivers
which was not possible with a car. These schools were replaced with Katombola and Mandia respectively.
Chinkonzya Primary school was replaced with Nyawa Primary School.
On the supply side, representatives from Provincial Resource Centre Coordinators (PRCC), District Resource
Centre Coordinators (DRCC), Zonal In-service Coordinators (ZIC) and other key stakeholders were
interviewed. The list of interviews conducted is presented in the table below:

g. Designing of evaluation tools
Based on insights from the initial consultations, the team developed draft classroom observation tool and draft
evaluation tools for qualitative and quantitative data collection. Furthermore, the key evaluation questions given
in the ToR were also referred to while designing the Catch-Up learning assessment and KII tools. In addition,
the United Nations Evaluations Guidelines (UNEG) document was referred to draft the evaluation tools. The
KII tools included a combination of open and closed ended questions: the open-ended ones being used to
elaborate on the closed responses. Pre-loaded Catch-Up learning assessment and KII tools on handheld devices
and recorders were used to conduct Catch-Up learning assessment and KIIs, while at the same time physically
recording the responses. The voice recordings were later used to check and add to the responses as required.
h. Approval of evaluation protocol and tools by UNICEF and ethical clearance from UNZAREC and
NHRA
The evaluation design and the evaluation tools were reviewed and approved by UNICEF, the Evaluation
Reference Group (ERG). The ethical approval was obtained from UNZA Research and Ethics Committee
(UNZAREC), and the study was approved by National Health Research Authority (NHRA).
i. Piloting evaluation tools
The evaluation tools were piloted in two districts namely Chipata and Choma. The process ensured that there
were no redundancies in the questions, and the language and flow of questions were appropriate. Based on the
piloting, the tools were modified and finalised.
j. Training of evaluation team
The Team Leader/International Evaluation Expert trained the team members, including the enumerators and
supervisors, on the process of administering the Catch-Up learning assessment and KIIs. The three-day training
was organised virtually via MS Teams and included the following sessions:
• Introduction to the scale up of the Catch-Up programme and objectives of the evaluation
• Training on Qualitative and Quantitative research methodology
• Training on the learner’s assessment tools as well as all other data collection tools
• Orientation on field protocol to follow during field work
• Practice of the tools through role playing
• Orientation on the field work plan
• Pilot to familiarise teams with the tools to use and getting the feel of actual fieldwork
• Debrief after the pilot to clarify any issue in the tools
• Training on the special COVID-19 guidelines to follow while conducting interviews in the field
• Division of roles and responsibilities during the fieldwork process
Page 29 of 146
ACER © 2021 Commercial in Confidence
Final Evaluation Report || Evaluation of Catch Up Scale Up Programme in Zambia
The training on the Catch-Up assessment tool was conducted in person by MoGE staff from the Eastern and
Southern provinces. One full day of training was conducted in each of the two provinces during which the
enumerators and supervisors were trained on the methods of a) administering the tools, b) recording responses
and c) scoring the performance of learners. Practical exercises were conducted by the trainers to enable the
participants to understand the nuances of the tools and their application.
k. Fieldwork
Following the training of enumerators, the evaluation team, including the Project Manager and Fieldwork
Quality Assurance Expert from the research team, initiated the fieldwork in February 2021. The team was split
into two sub-teams and each team was responsible to undertake the Catch-Up learning assessment and KIIs in
respective sample districts. The team of experts, supervisors, enumerators and quality control assistants
completed all the data collection at the district level in March 2021. The evaluation team undertook the KIIs
with the supply side respondents online via MS Teams. The interviews were completed by April 2021.
l. Ethical considerations
At every stage, the evaluation was guided by the United Nations Evaluation Guidelines (UNEG) and Ethical
Research Involving Children (ERIC) guidelines. The design of the evaluation incorporated a clear human rights,
equity and gender perspective. Care was taken to include these dimensions while conducting the fieldwork. To
ensure impartiality, the evaluation team considered the views of all stakeholders. The team ensured the
confidentiality and security of sensitive information derived from the interviews and prior consent was taken
from each stakeholder before interacting with them. The team strictly followed the obligation of evaluations,
that is, independence, impartiality, credibility, no conflict of interest, honesty and integrity, and accountability.
The evaluators observed the obligations towards the participants including respect for Dignity and Diversity,
Rights, Confidentiality and Avoidance of Harm.

4.3. Data analysis
4.3.1. Quantitative data analysis
The data was analysed using a mixed method approach. The quantitative analysis of clean and merged
data set involved computation of standard descriptive statistics and application of univariate and
bivariate analysis. The results—disaggregated by grade, gender and location—was presented in tabular
form along with data visualisation through charts and infographics.
4.3.2. Qualitative data analysis
Thematic content analysis of qualitative data gathered from KIIs was done. The content analysis
involved coding, categorisation, tagging and thematic analysis of qualitative data.
Coding, recoding and developing codebooks: The process of content analysis began with intensive
reading and re-reading of KII transcripts and notes for coding according to the themes/issues (subject
matter) that emerged from KII data. The analysis relied on deductive coding (i.e., concept or research
driven coding) based on available empirical evidence and the research topics/issues.
Categorisation and summarising themes: Following the coding process, the KII data was organised
into similar categories, ultimately leading to identification and summarisation of key themes based on
contextual data (e.g., socioeconomic data) and other information that would help better understand the
study findings.
Qualitative data analysis was done using MS Excel spreadsheets, using its various built-in features
including sorting menu and pivot table.
4.4. Limitations
Some of the limitations experienced during the evaluation were as follows:
1. In some cases, the actual sample was not achieved, as the schools were inaccessible due to
flooding in Kazungula and Monze districts and due to the unavailability of sufficient number
of respondents in Chipata district when the evaluation was conducted. In Monze, 2 out of 8
schools could not be reached due to floods in the area and the poor road network caused by the
the rains. Therefore, the DEBs suggested to replace the two schools namely; Nyimba Primary
and Kaloba primary with Nteme primary and Kaumuzya west primary respectively. In
Kazungula, Chooma River and Zalu Primary schools were replaced because they were
inaccessible at the time when the evaluation was conducted, to get there the team needed to
cross three rivers which was not possible with a car. These schools were replaced with
Katombola and Mandia respectively. Chinkonzya Primary school was replaced with Nyawa
Primary School.
2. Another factor that affected the sample size was unavailability of sufficient number of
respondents due to low attendance in some schools. In such instances, additional students from
other schools were sampled.
3. The programme implementation period is 2017–2020 and the midline evaluation was planned
between September 2019 and May 2020. However, due to COVID19, the evaluation extended
to August 2021. The delay in the evaluation was due to several factors, such as, indefinite
closure of schools, changes in the school calendar, and disruptions in the Catch-Up classes
owing to the closure of schools. The data collection could take place only in March 2021
because a minimum number of weeks of Catch-Up classes needed to be conducted before
assessing the learning outcomes of learners. The time lapse between the start of the evaluation
and data collection posed a challenge in some instances in finding the number of sampled
learners for literacy and numeracy assessments. This has been mentioned in the above note as
Page 34 of 146
ACER © 2021 Commercial in Confidence
Final Evaluation Report || Evaluation of Catch Up Scale Up Programme in Zambia
well. In all such instances, additional learners were assessed from other schools within the
sample.
4. The results of the literacy and numeracy assessment need to be interpreted with caution as the
learners had to be tested after only about three weeks of Catch Up classes. Previous assessments
prove that when learners undertake Catch-Up classes over a sustained period, remarkable
improvements are observed in their performance.36
5. The findings are based on reporting by respondents. In the absence of records to corroborate
each finding, the team had to rely on anecdotal evidence. As a mitigation measure, to the extent
possible, the findings have been further triangulated with the information generated through
KIIs with the stakeholders.
6. In the absence of data on vulnerability in the sampled districts and also lack of records on
children with special education needs, the evaluation design could not incorporate a rights based
approach. For future evaluations, it is expected that the relevant information on these aspects
would be available to inform the evaluation design.

Chapter 5. Findings and analysis
In this chapter we report the evaluation findings, based on both the quantitative and qualitative analysis
from the midline evaluation. The student assessment results are compared with the assessment results
from the baseline evaluation to check any improvement in the student learning. In the absence of the
results framework of the programme, the evaluation team has drawn upon the indicators in the
evaluation matrix for analysing the criteria of effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, sustainability and
equity.
5.1. Effectiveness
As mentioned in the introduction to the report, the performance of early grade learners in Zambia, in
regional as well as national assessments, such as, SACMEQ III, NAS 2016 and PISA-D has been below
par as per the expectations of MoGE. In the evaluation survey, provincial and district level staff and
teachers were asked about major learning challenges among students. 38 % of the survey participants
in Southern province, whereas, 37% in the Eastern province reported that learners demonstrated
learning difficulties in both literacy and numeracy. Between literacy and numeracy, a larger proportion
of the participants stated that learning challenges were faced in numeracy (38 % in Eastern Province
and 35 % in Southern Province) than literacy (27 % in Southern Province and 25 % in Eastern Province).
The only variation evident here is, that 2% more respondents in Southern province reported that the
learning difficulties were greater in literacy.

A similar pattern was reported from key informant interviews conducted with staff from MoGE,
UNICEF, USAID, TaRL Africa, Pratham and VVOB. All of them agreed that the Zambian learners
were performing poorly in literacy and numeracy assessments. Since the expansion of education in
2000, the education system has grown rapidly within two decades to accommodate millions of children.
With this effort, Zambia achieved high enrolment rate, nearing universal primary education. However,
the rapid expansion of enrolment has not kept pace with the quality of education. There are several
factors behind it, such as infrastructure gaps including limited classrooms, shortage of books, shortage
of teaching learning material, shortage of qualified teachers and high pupil-teacher ratio, which have
resulted in learning gaps between what learners know and what learners are expected to know.
The respondents to the key informant interviews suggested that different factors may have resulted in
the learning difficulties among learners, although there is a dearth of literature to corroborate this
opinion. Five out of seven key informants stated that increased class size might be one of the major
reasons for the deterioration of education quality. Two key informants found that the current focus on
curriculum delivery in education, low status of teaching profession and lack of pedagogical skills of
teachers hindered student learning progress. The survey participants and the key informants considered
the Catch-Up programme highly effective. However, it was difficult to conclude the same based on the
student assessment results.

5.1.1. Basic skill level outcomes of learners
Improvement of student literacy and numeracy skill is the fundamental step in the causal chain that
should be achieved through the Catch-Up programme. To measure the effect on student basic skill level
outcomes, we focused on test scores in the following assessments as our primary outcomes:
• Local language
• Number Recognition
• Maths operation: 1 (Addition and Subtraction)
• Maths operation: 2 (Multiplication and Division)
The tools used to measure student learning were the Catch-Up learning assessment tools and learners
were informed that these tests would have no impact on their grades or educational attainment overall.
In addition, learners were randomly selected to take part in the assessment.
5.1.1.1. Literacy assessment tool
The local language assessment tool consists of tasks set at various levels that could be used by teachers
to assign learners to a group based on their performance on the test.
The levels at which the learners were placed based on their performance are as below:
Level Description
Beginner The learner cannot read four letters.
Letter The learner can read at least four out of five letters correctly but cannot read at
least four out of five words correctly.
Words The learner can read at least four out of five words correctly and makes more than
three mistakes when reading a simple paragraph.
Simple The learner can read a paragraph without breaking sentences into separate words
paragraph and making only three or fewer mistakes but makes more than three mistakes while
reading a story.
Story The learner can read a story, even if slowly, and makes three or fewer mistakes.
5.1.1.2. Numeracy assessment tool
Numeracy assessment tool consists of three parts, namely number recognition, operations 1 (addition
and subtraction) and operations 2 (multiplication and division). The various levels for the three parts
were separately assessed and then learners placed according to their performance on each.
The levels in which learners were placed were based on the following level descriptions:
Number recognition
Level Description
Beginner The learner cannot name at least four of the one-digit numbers given.
Level 1 The learner can name at least four of the one-digit numbers given but cannot name
at least four of the two-digit numbers given.
Level 2 The learner can name at least four of the two-digit numbers but cannot name at
least four of the three-digit numbers.
Level 3 The learner can name at least four of the three-digit numbers but cannot name at
least four of the four-digit numbers.
Level 4 The learner can name at least four of the four-digit numbers.
Page 37 of 146
ACER © 2021 Commercial in Confidence
Final Evaluation Report || Evaluation of Catch Up Scale Up Programme in Zambia
Operations – 1 (Addition and subtraction)
Level Description
Beginner These learners are not able to do either two addition sums or two subtraction sums.
Addition These learners can do at least two addition sums but cannot do at least two
subtraction sums
Subtraction These learners can do at least two subtraction sums.
Learners are expected to reach Subtraction level by the end of Grade 2.
Operations – 2 (Multiplication and division)
Level Description
Beginner These learners are unable to do either two multiplication sums or two division
sums.
Multiplication These learners can do only two multiplication sums but cannot do two division
sums
Division These learners can do only two multiplication sums and two division sums
By the end of Grade 2 learners are expected to have reached division level for mathematics.
5.1.1.3. Programme effects on literacy outcomes of learners
Indicators
Proportion of learners with improved reading skills
In foundational literacy, there is a clear pathway which learners should follow. One should be able to
recognise letters before reading words. Once learners build their set of vocabulary, they can read short
sentences. After that, the length of reading increases to long and complex sentences, followed by
paragraphs and then stories. This pathway is laid out very well in the levels defined in the literacy
assessment tool. The tool enables us to gauge where a student is in the learning path. The comparison
of the assessment results from the baseline and midline assessments tells us if the learners are learning
effectively during their participation in the Catch-Up programme. However, it needs to be noted that
the assessment during the evaluation happened after the resumption of school following the closure due
COVID-19. The learners had attended the Catch-Up classes only for about a month. Therefore the
results of the assessment need to be interpreted with caution.
In the Southern province, more than one third of the learners were able to read a story, reaching the
highest Story level (35% in the baseline and 34% in the midline). The proportions of learners who are
at word and simple paragraph levels stayed more or less the same in both the assessments. Almost one
out of five learners were able to read a simple paragraph (18% in both the assessments). The proportion
of students who can identify four words were 12 % in the baseline and 11 % in the midline. However,
the proportion of student who can identify at least four letters (Letter level) dropped from 15 % in the
baseline to 9 % in the midline. It is noteworthy that there was a significant increase in the proportion of
learners at beginner level who are not able to recognise four letters by 9 % in the midline assessment.
One of the reasons behind this as stated by the Catch-up teachers was the delayed start of classes owing
to the pandemic.
The results of the assessment are summarised in the figures below:

word levels decreased by 5 % and 3 % respectively. There was an increase in the lowest level, showing
7 % hike in the proportion of the beginner level from 22 % to 29 %. In comparison with the assessment
results in Southern province, greater proportion of learners remained at the lowest level (beginner level)
and relatively small proportion of them reached the highest level (story level) in the Eastern province
with the figures for the two levels being 29% and 28% respectively.

The assessment results showed that the proportion of learners at the lowest level, failing to recognise at
least four letters, increased while that of students at the highest level, reading a story, decreased in the
midline assessment. While the proportion of learners able to read a simple paragraph has increased, the
fact that the proportion of learners who cannot identify letters increased, calls for further investigation.
The variation in learning outcomes in literacy could be a result of the disruption in school and irregular
Catch-Up classes owing to the COVID19 pandemic.
5.1.1.4. Programme effects on numeracy outcomes of learners
Indicators
Proportion of learners with improved mathematical skills
The mathematics assessment tool consists of two parts: number recognition and operations. The
operations part is further split into two sections: one being addition and subtraction and the other being
multiplication and division. Each part has learners placed at a certain level based on their performance.
In the number recognition part, learners are to be placed in one of the five levels as discussed in section
5.1.1.2. In this section, assessment results of the three areas of mathematical skills from both the
baseline and midline assessments will be analysed.
Number recognition
When we check the results from Southern Province, it is noted that the proportions of learners at
Beginner level were lower (6% in the baseline and 2% in the midline) than those of the two provinces
combined (9% in the baseline and 7% in the midline). In Southern Province, the percentage of learners
at Level 1, recognition of at least four one-digit numbers, went up by 4% in the midline assessment
from 9% to 13 %, which was the same degree of decrease in the midline assessment at the Beginner
level, failure to recognise at least four one-digit numbers.

The student learning outcomes of number recognition in the numeracy assessment were distributed the
same way in both the assessments. Around a third of the learners can recognise four-digit numbers in
both the assessments, reaching the highest level, Level 4. The proportion of students at Level 4 went up
by 2 % from 33 % to 35 % in the midline assessment. The difference in performance between the
baseline and midline was within 2 % at all the levels except Level 3, recognition of three-digit numbers.
There was a 5 % drop in the proportion of learners who can name at least four of the three-digit numbers.
A little more than 80 % of the learners were able to recognise numbers of two or more digits. This fact
supports that most of the learners can recognise two-digit numbers and are ready to start with
mathematical operations.

Operation 1 – Addition and Subtraction
The assessment on number operations 1 and 2 constitute four fundamental mathematical operations,
addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Addition and subtraction are covered by Operation1,
while multiplication and division are covered by Operations 2.
The proportions of learners at Beginner level (44% in the baseline and 46% in the midline) were higher
than those at Subtraction level (38% and 39%) in Southern Province. This means that the students who
cannot do both addition and subtraction outnumbered the students who can do addition and subtraction.
There is no clear evidence of improvement of students learning outcomes in addition and subtraction
skills from the assessment results from Southern Province.

Operation 2 – Multiplication and Division
Multiplication and division are difficult numeracy skills to attain for learners who do not master addition
and subtraction. This is shown by the assessment results.
In the Southern province, 73% could do neither multiplication nor division at the baseline. However, a
significant improvement was shown in the midline assessment. The proportion of learners who reached
division level increased from 8 % to 31 % in the province, displaying an increase of 23 %. This means
that more than 30 % of learners from Southern province were able to do both multiplication and division
by the midline assessment.

not do either multiplication or division in both the assessments. However, the midline assessment results
tell us that the proportion of learners at beginner level was reduced by 18% from 69 % to 51 %. This
improvement well explained the 20 % increase at division level, from 9 % in the baseline to 29 % in
the midline evaluation.

To summarise the findings, the students’ ability to recognise numbers improved in the midline
assessment by a 2 % increase at the highest level (recognition of four-digit numbers) and a 2 % decrease
at the lowest level (failure to recognise one-digit numbers). The assessment results show that more than
80 % of the learners were able to recognise numbers of two or more digits, showing that they were
ready to start with numerical operations.
There continues to be around 40 % of learners who are not able to do basic mathematical operations of
addition and subtraction in the midline assessment, while the proportion of students attaining addition
and subtraction skills increased. It is noteworthy that there was a significant improvement in the
proportion of students who can do both addition and subtraction functions in Eastern Province. The
midline assessment results show that almost 30% of the learners attained both multiplication and
division skills.
To summarize the findings of literacy and numeracy, there is a varied trend in the proportion of learners
across levels. However, this is not in line with the earlier assessments conducted between 2018-2020,
where a consistent improvement is evident in their performance in both literacy and numeracy37. The
assessment data for the three years across one of the learning levels is as follows:

Jan-July,2019 35% 56% 27% 51%
Jan-Mar,2020 37% 48% 29% 42%
The only plausible explanation for the varied trend in learning outcomes during the mid-line assessment
is the disruption in Catch-Up classes as well as regular schooling during the COVID19 pandemic. It
would therefore be pertinent to add here that the findings of the midline assessment should be
interpreted with caution as they may not be a true reflection of the effectiveness of the Catch-Up
programme. When implemented over a complete academic year, the programme has shown promising
results throughout the period of 2018 to early 2020, prior to the onset of the pandemic.

5.1.2. Effective aspects of the programme
5.1.2.1. Teacher’s knowledge of Catch-Up programme and the TaRL methodology
Continuous training of teachers in the TaRL methodology and monitoring have been key elements of
the Catch-Up programme. Considering the poor performance of learners in the national, regional and
international assessments in recent years, the Catch-Up programme with its TaRL methodology was
considered an effective way of remedial learning by MoGE. The TaRL methodology had been
successfully implemented in India by Pratham, a non-government organization working on education
reforms. Before scaling up the programme, three different models were piloted in the Eastern and
Southern provinces, out of which one was selected as the most useful. In addition to the 96 teachers, all
the 7 key informants who participated in the interviews suggested that the Catch-Up programme helped
in improving learners’ performance in literacy and numeracy.
Indicators
Proportion of teachers trained on the TaRL methodology
In terms of capacity building, all 96 teachers across the two provinces responded that they received
training on the TaRL methodology.

Furthermore, six district level officials responded to the ways in which Catch-Up programme assisted
the teachers. The respondents were allowed to provide multiple responses based on their opinions and
the responses are summarised in the following table. They found the simple and easy teaching activities
and the use of local language for instruction as most useful.

The programme was attractive to learners as they were grouped based on their level of understanding
and given an opportunity to learn at their own level through creative exercises and innovative ways of
learning. 62% of the surveyed teachers from Eastern Province (N=42) reported innovative ways of
learning applied during the Catch-Up classes attracted the learners. In the Southern Province however,
an almost equal proportion of teachers stated creative exercises (35%) and innovative ways of learning
(37%) as the factors that attracted learners the most (N=54).

schools. It is reported that the Ministry managed official school monitoring using the system. Most
frequent monitoring of the participating schools was conducted by the Zonal In-Service Coordinators
(ZICs) on a monthly basis. District Resource Coordinators (DRCs) were expected to visit schools at
least once a term. A week-long monitoring and mentoring support were coordinated every five to six
weeks by the implementation agency. During the monitoring, if a school faced severe difficulties, such
as understaffing and student absenteeism due to famine, it was reported to the Ministry and the
implementation agency to mitigate the issues.
The trainers of the programme followed up the implementation of the TaRL methodology all the time
or frequently, according to the survey respondents. Almost 40 % of the respondents agreed that the
trainers always followed up the implementation of TaRL methodology at schools. Close to 60 % of the
participants identified that follow-ups happened sometimes.

5.1.3. Reasons behind the achievement of programme outcomes
The interviewees appreciated that MoGE showed ownership and enthusiasm for the successful
implementation of the programme. Support from the Ministry combined with the strong partnership
among the key stakeholders enabled smooth implementation of the programme. For example, the
Education Manager at VVOB, recollected the following:
“When we heard schools were closing due to COVID last year, we were a few weeks off doing
a midline but then we asked the Ministry if they can send a memo out that we do the midline
now. Within 48 hours we were able to access 197 thousand children. And I don't think there are
many NGOs that would be able to get that done within 48 hours. Of course, it was the Ministry
that got it done.”
All the seven key informants interviewed agreed that the implementation agency, VVOB, provided
sufficient training for the master trainers to prepare for training of teachers on the Catch-Up
methodologies with ample hands-on practices. The implementing agency managed to retain a group of
experienced master trainers who joined at the earlier stage of the programme for Southern and Eastern
Provinces and deployed them to effectively train teachers in other provinces during the expansion.
From the survey, group work was used effectively during training.

school hours was the best approach towards remedial learning. The other one-third of the respondents
gave a few reasons for not considering one hour of extra class as the best approach: “Grades 3 and 4
learners have to wait for Grade 5 learners to have the lesson together,” “One hour is not enough, as
some kids might need extra time” and “The learners to teacher ratio is not as per the standards. It
burdens/stresses the teachers.”

5.1.4. Challenges faced in achievement of some outcomes
The first thing which the key informants listed as a challenge faced was the high pupil-teacher ratio.
They stated that it was not unusual to see 80 to 100 learners in a classroom for one teacher. Three out
of seven of the key informants found that the current focus on curriculum delivery in education, low
status of teaching profession and lack of pedagogical skills of teachers hindered student learning.
The survey participants also listed the reasons behind learning difficulties. Even though only a handful
of responses (14 responses) were collected from the six district officials surveyed, many of the
responses indicated that the reasons behind poor learning were linked to the quality of teachers,
including the way teachers introducing topics, insufficient understanding of the concepts of subject,
delivery of teaching, poor teaching methods, etc.
Some of the reasons behind learning difficulties (N=14)
Number recognition has been a challenge. This has to do with the way the teachers introduce the 3-digit
numbers where the learners are not properly taught to say it as a whole.
Teachers had challenges to handle mathematics questions.
Teachers do not really understand the concepts of their subject.
The delivery of teachers is not helpful to pupils.
There has not been a lot of concrete learning.
Most learners are coming from normal class into catch-up class.
User-friendly methods were not available.
Operations division and multiplication teachers have a challenge in teaching the concept.
Teachers find it difficult to teach division and multiplication.
The negative mindset about numeracy.
Poor teaching methods.
No role model.
On subtraction teachers have a problem with explaining the take away concept to the learners.
Teachers underestimate the learners.
The survey participants identified some measures that ensured effective delivery of the programme.
Among them are planning the activities and Catch-Up class monitoring (21 %), monitors’ engagement
and review meetings (21 %), following up with teachers and discussions with the management (20 %),
and teacher support and encouragement (17 %).

mistakes by teachers. However, these opinions are based on a small number of respondents (N=3) and
need more consideration before implementation.

5.2. Efficiency
Efficiency of the programme is one of the most important aspects to be evaluated. This section will
explore the results from the survey and the key informant interviews. It is reported by the key informants
that there had been constant training and retraining provided for teachers when the need is identified.
The teachers were open to feedback given by the monitors and mentors during the programme and
incorporated the feedback in their teaching.
More than two thirds of the 161 survey participants (68 %) responded that the Catch-Up programme
was implemented in a cost-effective manner. It needs to be mentioned here that the cost effectiveness
of the programme is as reported by the respondents. In the absence of data pertaining to actual
disbursement of funds, the evaluation team had to consider the anecdotal evidence for analysis.
Therefore, it may be too early to conclude that the programme was cost effective, since the responses
are based on perception of the participants.

As per the findings of the survey, only 17 % of the respondents experienced frequent slippage in keeping
the Catch-Up schedule set by the teachers or mentors. From this, it can be assumed that there may have
been some instances of skipping of scheduled classes. However, it is to be noted that this finding is
based on the survey responses only.

5.2.2. Sufficiency of resources
Indicators
Proportion of teachers confirming that they received adequate resources from the school
management to support Catch-up activities
The Education Manager, VVOB, identified the Catch-Up programme as one of the low resource-
intensive programmes, which requires space, time and teachers and utilises free materials, such as
stones, sticks, cardboard boxes, and so on. The key informants recollected from their experience that
the programme was run with minimum additional resources. The Catch-Up classes could be managed
outdoors in schools with limited space. The school administration emphasised that the Catch-Up
programme was not an additional programme but a part of their core duty so teachers accepted the
burden of additional classes without much resistance.
When the respondents were asked if the resources were sufficient, three out of five (61 %) answered
that they were sufficient, while the remaining found them to be insufficient. Clearly, there is a gap in
the perception of school administration and the Catch-Up teachers when it comes to the sufficiency of
resources. 35 teachers stated that more teaching and learning materials were required, such as story
books for the learners who reached the highest level of literacy (Story level).

5.2.3. Programme monitoring and delivery challenges
The interviewees identified that availability of transport played an important role in monitoring of the
Catch-Up programme. It is not easy for monitors to visit more than 100 widespread schools without
transport being arranged for by the Ministry. Availability of transport has been an issue for DRCCs and
Provincial Resource Centre Coordinators (PRCCs) since they have to cover wider geographical areas
and larger number of schools than ZICs who only need to cover shorter distances. Based on the reality,
it is important to emphasise school level monitoring of the programme. It is highly recommended to
explore innovative methods of monitoring to overcome the difficulties.
All the survey respondents except one (98 %) confirmed that assessment data of the Catch-Up learners
were collected by the monitors regularly.

The survey participants were asked to identify the methods used for programme monitoring at the school
level. Nearly half the participants (46 %) stated that monitoring was done by physical visits to the
location, a quarter of them used routine monitoring reports and less than 10 % of them (8 %) listed
review meetings to monitor at the province level. However, 21% of the participants mentioned that all
the three methods (physical visits, monitoring reports and review meetings) were used for monitoring.

It is to be noted that the implementation agency, VVOB, keeps monitoring the student learning outcome
data. VVOB compared the learning outcome data and discussed the data during the meetings with
MoGE and other relevant ministries. The data helped the ministry identify the challenges faced in
districts in terms of learning gaps and devise measures to address them.
In summary, the scale up of the Catch-Up programme was perceived to be implemented in a cost-
effective manner and in most cases, the classes were held as per schedule. The training and mentoring
support were frequent, and the summary reports were perceived to be useful in a large majority of cases.
However, in terms of the sufficiency of resources there is a gap in understanding between programme
participants and stakeholders. The stakeholders’ perception was that the programme did not require
much in the way of resources, but the implementers suggested that there is a need for more resources
particularly as learners reach higher levels of achievement. The primary challenge faced by monitors
was managing wide coverage areas, especially due to limited availability of transport. However, the
frequency of monitoring, both collection of assessment data and physical visits, was high. Other
methods of monitoring included routine monitoring reports and meetings at provincial level.

5.3. Relevance
This section will explore the results from the survey and the key informant interviews related to the
relevance measure. Three aspects will be discussed: the relevance of the programme overall, the
consistency between specific objectives and overall programme goals, and whether implemented
activities are the best means of achieving the intended impacts.
5.3.1. Relevance of the programme
Indicators
Proportion of respondents agreeing to the usefulness and continuity of Catch-Up
Almost all the survey respondents (98 %) agreed that the Catch-Up programme was useful and needed
to continue.

The key informants also confirmed that they found the programme very useful in addressing the learning
difficulties and closing learning gaps and hoped it would continue. The Senior Education Officer,
MoGE, stated that she considered the Catch-Up programme to be extremely relevant in improving
student learning in foundational literacy and numeracy in a country like Zambia where the proportion
of remote schools is high.
More than 90 % of the survey respondents agreed that the remedial teaching activities of the Catch-Up
programme generated interest among the teachers and learners. The different approaches of activity-
based learning, which the Catch-Up programme adopts, encourages teachers and students and generates
interests to participate in the teaching-learning activities, such as game-based activities, group activities,
and activities that use flash cards.

needs
Nearly 90 % of the survey respondents agreed that the results of the programme were consistent with

When the district level officers were asked if the results of the intervention were consistent with the
strategic priorities of DEBs, five out of six of them responded positively to the question. All the three
provincial officials who participated in the survey agreed that the Catch-up programme was adequately
aligned with the strategic priorities of PEO. The respondents felt that the programme contributed to the
improvement of literacy and numeracy skills of learners and addressed the problems faced by students
in numeracy and literacy.

5.3.3. Consistency of the implemented activities with the intended impacts
Indicators
Proportion of respondents stating that they provided feedback to the Catch-Up implementation
team
Many stakeholders give periodic feedback to the implementation team. Among them is the Education
Specialist, UNICEF Zambia, who stated the following:
“… every time I’ve had an opportunity to go out in the field, I’ve always made the most of the
opportunity to give feedback to the Ministry colleagues as well as VVOB. I’ve always given
feedback in terms of what we found on the ground and I think what this has done is that it has
enabled us to have very open discussions in terms of where we can tweak the programme and
in terms of how we can make some changes just so that we can address some of the gaps that
have been identified.”
According to the Education Manager at VVOB, the implementing agency set up weekly team meetings
and shared the feedback continuously. During the meetings, VVOB, TaRL-Africa and/or Pratham
experts collaborate and cooperate to prepare for trainings with technical feedback. VVOB also receives
feedback from the Ministry about staff and then quickly incorporates and responds to the feedback after
careful reflection.
In summary, the Catch-Up programme was perceived to be extremely relevant to the Zambian context.
The programme is perceived to be extremely important in achieving foundational literacy and
numeracy. The overall goals of the programme are perceived to be in line with the strategic priorities
of the MoGE, PEOs and DEBs. Finally, stakeholder participation in terms of providing feedback is high
and the feedback provided is regular and perceived to have been taken on board. For example, the
implementation agency, VVOB, compares the learning outcome data and discusses them during the
meetings with MoGE, which helps the latter identify challenges faced in districts and act on addressing
them.

5.4. Sustainability
This section will explore the results from the survey and the key informant interviews related to the
sustainability measure. The major factors that impact sustainability are the engagement level of the
system, the MoGE in this case, capacity building at the local level and the confidence of the
implementers to continue the programme without external support. Additionally, the perception about
specific activities to ensure sustainability of the programme are also discussed.
5.4.1. MoGE engagement in delivering the programme
In the implementation of the scale up of the Catch-Up programme, MoGE used its own government
system for running the programme. The programme had integrated with the government structure at the
zonal, district and provincial levels. The human resources in the government structure, such as ZICs
and DRCCs, were provided to run the programme. Most of the monitoring was done by the government
system and MoGE oversaw mobility of ZICs and DRCCs. However, MoGE’s budget for providing
transport was limited and thus, some difficulty was faced in conducting visits to schools in remote, rural
areas. It is recommended to develop innovative ways to overcome the difficulty in monitoring.
5.4.2. Dependency on partners for the technical assistance
From the beginning of the programme, there has been intensive involvement of technical partners,
including TaRL Africa/Pratham, J-PAL and VVOB. Technical support on strengthening teaching,
programme design and capacity building across the system was provided by the partners. TaRL
Africa/Pratham focused on providing significant technical support for the implementation of the
programme and J-PAL’s support was based on their strength in research.
After 20 months of implementation of the programme, the implementation team has accumulated
sufficient experience and has been able to apply the Catch-Up strategies with adaptations to fit the
Zambian context. The Head of International Collaborations at Pratham evaluated the technical readiness
of the implementation team to be quite high during the key informant interview and stated:
“The master trainer teams at the provincial level are quite strong, so if there’s further technical
capacity building required, I think that there are resources already built in there that can
continue.”
Based on the technical expertise achieved by the master trainers after nearly two years of programme
implementation, all stakeholders expressed a positive opinion that the programme would be able to
continue without external technical support in the future. However, they indicated that gradual and
phased withdrawal of support would work since the programme was implemented in a phased manner,
and the schools starting late on the programme might need continued support for some time.
5.4.3. Sustainable approaches of the programme
Indicators
Proportion of respondents stating that the programme could continue without external support
Proportion of respondents stating at least one reason for the continuation of the programme without
external support
All participants (provincial, district and zonal officers, teachers, monitors and school principals) were
asked if the Catch-Up programme could continue without external support. The survey participants
expressed their positive opinion on the sustainability of the programme. Three quarters of the
participants stated that the Catch-Up programme could continue without external support. However,
almost a quarter of the respondents (24 %) disagreed that the programme could continue without
external support. Among the reasons most cited were shortage of funds, teachers and teacher training,
and no incentives to run the programme.

5.4.3.1. Incorporating the TaRL methodology in MoGE’s remedial learning approach
It was clear from the interview of the Senior Education Officer, Teacher Education at MoGE that MoGE
hopes to incorporate the TaRL methodology into its remedial learning approach. The programme has
been already significantly expanded in the country to address the learning difficulties among young
learners. The methodology adopted by the programme is well accepted as an effective way of teaching.
The ministry agreed that the programme had shown its effectiveness in bridging the gaps in learning in
many ways. One of the most valuable advantages of the programme is that the programme methodology
is already integrated into the education system and MoGE has retained human resources to further
expand it to the national level.
During the interview, the Senior Education Officer indicated that there is a possibility of integrating the
TaRL methodology through the School Program of In-service Training for the Term (SPRINT) to
maximise the benefit of the Catch-Up programme. In this way, MoGE could envision all the teachers
understanding the methodology and applying it in their teaching to promote better learning outcomes.
The schools on their part will have to volunteer to undertake the extra work resulting from implementing
the TaRL methodology.
5.4.4. Promising avenues to better implement the Catch-Up programme
The survey participants were asked the question, “Are there deliberate activities to build ownership and
capacity of Master Trainers, mentors and teachers for sustainability purposes?” The response patterns
to this question were different in the two provinces. 70 % of the respondents from Southern province
agreed that there were such activities, while 20 % of them disagreed. On the other hand, most popular
choice selected by the respondents from Eastern province was “Don’t know” or “Refused to answer”
(57 %).

Some of the respondent teachers indicated that support would be required from school leadership to
continue the Catch-Up remedial learning activities. The areas that were mentioned as requiring support
are provided in the table below.
Support required from school leadership to continue with the remedial learning activities in the school
Financial support for the learners to buy books, resources that are not available locally
Capacity building training, coaching and mentoring
Encouragement and motivation in the form of incentives, etc.
Monitoring and supervision of teachers
Provide adequate materials for learning and teaching
In summary, the programme is considered highly sustainable. The engagement of MoGE with the
programme is quite high. Officials in the system are incorporated into the programme as monitors and
trainers. Furthermore, there is buy-in from the government on incorporating the programme into the
system and scaling it up nationally. Sufficient capacity and confidence are perceived to have been built
up so that the programme can continue without external support. However, teachers have pointed out
that support from the system in specific areas, including financial support and capacity building, is
important for continuing successful implementation of the programme.

5.5. Equity and Gender
This section focuses on the equity and gender aspect of the programme. First, the perception of
participants is explored on whether vulnerable children have lower learning outcomes and retention or
if learners have issues with continuing education and the measures taken to address the issues at the
system level. This sections also discusses the efforts made by teachers to address the learning issues.
5.5.1. Exposure to vulnerable children and girls of the programme
Indicators
Proportion of respondents stating gender and poverty have a role to play in learning outcomes
Proportion of respondents stating they are making efforts to bridge the learning gap resulting from
vulnerability due to poverty/disability/violence
Almost three quarter of the survey respondents (74 %) agreed that there was a difference in the learning
outcomes of vulnerable children. Vulnerable children (made vulnerable because of gender, disabilities,
poor economic status, etc.) tend to perform lower and face more learning difficulties.

217 survey respondents reported the efforts made to bridge the learning gap resulting from vulnerability.
Encouragement, interaction and coordination among the learners were promoted. The teachers were
trained to show more love and care and to treat all the learners as equals. In some cases, inclusive
learning programme or school feeding programme run by MoGE was organised for the learners’ benefit.
A minority of the participants mentioned initiatives for encouraging children with disabilities. For
example, the initiatives mentioned were child protection group, careers day and reading camps.

A gender difference was noted when the participants were asked about continuity of education or
retention rate for female learners. 44 % of the respondents answered that continuity of education is
better among girls. This may be because of the gender-related stereotype that people have: 29 % of the
respondents from both provinces reported that there was no difference in retention rate between the two
gender groups. A little more than a quarter of the participants considered more boys continue their
education than girls. It seems that the perception is mixed, and we need further study on the matter.

outcomes. When the respondents were asked to elaborate upon their opinion, it was mentioned by 8 %
of the respondents (13 out of 167 responses) that girls performed better than boys. 28 % of the
respondents (46 out of 167 responses) related poverty and gender as discriminatory factors that hinder
girls. Poverty affects student learning since they come to school hungry and are frequently absent on
account of work to support the family income, resulting in insufficient study time. However, poverty
affects girls more since most families prefer their boys to be educated. When girls experience puberty,
they tend to stay home and often end up marrying early and pregnant. This shows that cultural and
traditional stereotypes also play an important role in people’s perception of gender, making it difficult
for girls to be educated.

However, Head of International Collaborations from Pratham disagreed that there is learning disparity
due to gender and vulnerability of children in the learning outcomes achieved as the impact of the Catch-
Up Programme. She concluded that attendance in the programme would have an impact on learning
outcomes as stated below:
“If attendance is uniform across different groups, we don’t have experience that shows that
learning outcomes differ by context. In fact, in cases where we do have gender data, we see
equal improvement for boys and girls. We don’t necessarily have this information for Zambia.
But in India, for example, we’ve definitely seen that.”
The Education Manager from VVOB reported during the key informant interview that it was shown
that boys were dropping out at a higher level than girls from the programme since the COVID-19
pandemic hit Zambia. The series of observations found from the stakeholders suggest there is a need
for systematic research on the vulnerable student population and their learning outcomes focusing on
the impact of the Catch-Up programme in Zambia.
75% of the survey participants reported that the Catch-Up classes included children with disabilities.
However, this was based on their perception rather than a formal record of children with disabilities
that they maintained.

Although there were children with disabilities in the Catch-Up classes, the teaching-learning activities
were not specifically designed to address their needs, and children with disabilities participated in the
classes in the same manner as their peers. However, the teachers in some instances were reported to
have been taking special care of such learners.

Special efforts made by teachers for children with disabilities reported by the respondents are mostly at
the individual teacher level rather than the programme level. As an effort to accommodate children with
disabilities, teachers gave special attention to those learners during the classes, gave more time to the
learners, tried to include the learners and demonstrated care and love towards them.

The key informants uniformly stated that there was no accommodation or special strategy made for the
children with disabilities at the programme level.
In summary, while there is consensus that learning outcomes are lower for vulnerable children, there is
a difference in perception on whether gender plays a role in retention or continuation of education across
provinces. Furthermore, it is suggested that the Catch-Up programme has similar impact on both male
and female learners. Due to lack of gender disaggregated data, the evaluation team has had to rely upon
anecdotal evidence in this regard. Some effort is also made by MoGE and schools to accommodate
vulnerable children. For learners with disabilities, accommodations are made at the level of the teacher,
however, owing to the paucity of data on children with disabilities, it is difficult to bring all such learners
within the ambit of the programme.

5.6. Classroom Observation
This section focuses on the classroom observations undertaken by the field teams. It would be apt to
mention here that prior to the start of the fieldwork, the team members in both the provinces were trained
by an MoGE official from the province. The training comprised an orientation of the TaRL approach,
its methodology for classroom transactions, how to observe classrooms and conduct literacy and
numeracy assessments using the approach. A total of 97 classroom observations were undertaken by
the team, of which 54 were done in the Southern Province while 43 classes were observed in the Eastern
Province. The observers went for the classroom observations after duly apprising the Head Teachers
about the purpose of the observation with the request that their visit was not to be announced to the
Catch-Up teacher. They took care to observe the proceedings from a distance without disturbing the
momentum of the class and duly recorded their observation on a pre-designed format.
Key findings from the classroom observation are presented below.

As stated earlier, a total of 97 classroom observations were undertaken by the team. These observations
were conducted both, in the Southern as well as the Eastern Province. District wise distribution of the
observed classrooms is presented in the figure below.

Of the 97 classroom sessions observed, 71 were in literacy while 26 were in numeracy. The prevalence
of literacy sessions was not by design but in accordance with the Catch-Up sessions planned during the
period. Since there was a greater focus on literacy classes during the period of data collection, the
number of classroom observations was greater in the subject.

5.6.2. Adherence to TaRL approaches in the observed classrooms
Indicators
Teachers paced learning activities appropriately
Teachers included locally available material during Catch-Up classes
Teachers demonstrated a command over the Catch-Up approach
Students willingly participated in classroom activities
Most students were engaged in the lesson throughout the duration of the class
One of the key factors in any classroom transaction by the teacher is the pacing of teaching learning
activities. The TaRL approach lays emphasis on responding to the learners’ needs during the remedial
learning classes. In 93 out of the 97 instances, it was observed that the teachers were pacing the
classroom activities appropriately so as to ensure that every child got a chance to participate in them.

The TaRL approach also lays a strong emphasis on the use of locally available material to facilitate the
teaching learning activities in the remedial learning classes. In 95 out of the 97 instances, it was
observed that the teachers were indeed using locally available material, such as, twigs, pebbles, leaves,
etc. to conduct the teaching learning activities.

95 out of the 97 teachers displayed a command over the TaRL approach while conducting the remedial
learning classes. They used locally available material, conducted lessons by level and ensured that the
learners were participating in the activities being conducted in the classroom. Related findings are
presented in the figure below.

Learners were generally found to be willingly participating in the Catch-Up classes. In 92 out of the 97
instances, the learners were observed to be active participants in the classroom activities. Only in 1
instance each in a school in Kazungula and Chipata did the observers notice that

Most learners were engaged throughout the Catch-Up classes. In 92 out of the 97 instances, the
observers found that the learners were fully involved and working in close groups with fellow learners.

To sum up, the classroom observations corroborate the findings pertaining to effectiveness and
sustainability of the programme. In an overwhelming majority of the instances, the teachers displayed
a strong understanding of the TaRL approach and were using it effectively for conducting the Catch-
Up classes. The learners were found to be engaged too which points to the effectiveness of the approach.
Since the teachers displayed a clear understanding of the approach, it may be concluded that at the
school level, the remedial learning methodology being followed is sustainable.

Chapter 6. Conclusions
The Catch-Up programme was considered to be extremely relevant to the Zambian context in achieving
foundational literacy and numeracy by most respondents. The education community in Zambia,
including the Ministry of General Education, embraced the Catch-Up programme as a practical solution
for the existing learning gaps among Zambian learners. The Catch-Up programme had reached 1,780
schools in Southern and Eastern Provinces by the end of 2020. The further scaling up of the programme
is expected to help improve the quality of education and to close the learning gaps in the country.
The strength of the programme comes from many aspects. The programme defines learning outcomes
required for foundational learning in a very simple manner making it easy to apply at large scale. It
applies simple and short assessment methodology to evaluate the level of student learning, which
produces assessment results quickly. Teacher training plays a significant role in the programme and
introduces student-centric teaching. Extra-remedial classes as the main programme activity for short
time period have proven effective to promote student learning after having implemented the TaRL
approach for years in India by Pratham. Owing to these strengths, the programme was able to secure
the ownership and scale up from MoGE. As reported by some respondents, it is likely for MoGE to
integrate the programme with its SPRINT programme and universalise it as a regular pre-service and
in-service teacher training programme.
To summarize the findings of literacy and numeracy, there is a varied trend in the proportion of learners
across levels. For example in literacy, overall, 22% learners assessed during the midline could read a
simple paragraph. This was an increase by 2 percentage points over the baseline. At the same time, 31%
learners were able to read a story, a decrease by 3%. Similarly, in numeracy, the assessment results
show that more than 80 % of the learners were able to recognise numbers of two or more digits, showing
that they were ready to start with numerical operations. Almost 30 % of the learners attained both
multiplication and division skills of G.
Clearly, these trends are not in line with the earlier assessments conducted between 2018-2020, where
a consistent improvement is evident in the performance of learners in both literacy and numeracy. The
only plausible explanation for the varied trend in learning outcomes during the mid-line assessment is
the disruption in Catch-Up classes during the COVID19 pandemic. A study conducted by VVOB and
TaRL Africa on learning losses due to the pandemic found that least 16% of Grades 3 to 5 learners
dropped a reading level, In the same grades, learners who lost the skills to do addition, subtraction,
multiplication or division, were 10%, 7%, 12% and 6% respectively. The same study reported that 2020
has been a year where G3-G5 learners made little or no progress on basic skills.38 It would therefore be
pertinent to add here that the findings of the midline assessment should be interpreted with caution as
they may not be a true reflection of the effectiveness of the Catch-Up programme. When implemented
over a complete academic year, the programme has shown promising results throughout the period of
2018 to early 2020, prior to the onset of the pandemic.
Based on the analysis of the survey and the stakeholder interviews, it can be concluded that the scale
up of the Catch-Up programme was implemented as designed and ensured the effectiveness of
partnerships and sustainability mechanisms. The stakeholders appreciated that MoGE showed
ownership and enthusiasm for the successful implementation of the programme. Support from the
ministry combined with the strong partnership, among J-PAL, Pratham, UNICEF, USAID and VVOB
in providing technical and financial support and coordination, enabled smooth implementation of the
programme. Stakeholder participation in terms of providing feedback was reported to be regular and
perceived to have been duly incorporated throughout implementation of the programme.
As reported by various stakeholders, the programme is likely to be sustainable without external support
in the long run. MoGE has been deeply engaged with the implementation of the programme and the
system has adapted well to it. Right from the school level up to the provincial level staff of MoGE, the

common understanding of the Catch-Up programme, its methodology and potential benefits are well
established. The Institutionalisation of Catch-Up strategies achieved during the scale up phase will be
of great help when the ministry further expands the programme to the national level. It was discussed
during the stakeholder interviews that the ministry would integrate the TaRL methodology with
SPRINT for the term as part of teacher training system of the country.
The survey participants and the key informants agreed that the programme was implemented in a cost-
effective manner generally and followed the planned schedule. Throughout the programme
implementation frequent monitoring and mentoring were provided using the MoGE system at the
provincial, district and zonal levels. Among the challenges in monitoring reported by the survey
participants and the key informants were wide coverage of remote areas, lack of availability of transport
and funding shortage of transport available. It was known to be expensive to maintain the training and
monitoring components of the programme. Some of the survey participants felt that more teaching and
learning materials were to be made available for better implementation of the programme in schools.
As far as equity was concerned, the school system automatically includes all vulnerable children within
its folds. As reported by the teachers, head teachers and MoGE staff, they had not come across any
instances of discrimination based on gender, economic or social background of learners. Having said
this, due to a paucity of data on vulnerability in general and disability in particular, a focused effort of
including such children in the programme and tracking their progress was not possible. At the
implementation level, the teachers and stakeholders reported that all learners were treated equitably
regardless of their socioeconomic background.
Overall, the programme was perceived successful by the survey participants and the stakeholders
satisfying most of the programme indicators. The programme was effective in training all participating
teachers who felt that learners improved in literacy and numeracy skills. Frequent monitoring and
mentoring provided feedback to teachers on a regular basis. Almost all the participants agreed to the
usefulness and continuity of the programme. Many of them thought the programme design was adequate
in addressing the needs of learners.
Having said that, it is difficult to conclude on the basis of the baseline and midline assessments that the
changes in learning outcomes in literacy and numeracy were solely due to the intervention only. The
results from both assessments show a similar pattern and in some cases the proportion of learners at the
beginner level turned out to be higher in the midline assessment. Some of the stakeholders pointed out
that there was a difficulty with implementing the expected programme activities as planned for the last
group of schools who joined the programme in 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It may be useful
to revisit the programme implementation in such schools to gauge the impact of the pandemic on
programme implementation and learning outcomes.

Chapter 7. Recommendations
During interviews with stakeholders, several recommendations were made for improving the Catch-Up
programme. Based on the suggestions and analysis of information collected from the teachers, monitors,
learners and different stakeholders (including UNICEF, USAID, MoE, J-PAL, Pratham and VVOB),
the key recommendations are summarised below. Alongside each recommendation, indicative timelines
have been added.
• Disparities in terms of expectations of teachers regarding the programme support through
mentoring were witnessed in the two regions. Going forward, the Ministry of Education(MoE)
needs to ensure that Catch-Up and similar other remedial learning programmes holds consistency
in the implementation and monitoring and mentoring across the provinces. (1-2 years)
• If the Catch-Up approach is to be adopted for remedial learning in the foundational grades and
implemented during school hours, the education system should have the capacity to respond to the
needs and levels of learners, focusing on child-centred teaching and learning. It is recommended
that the Catch-up methodology be integrated into the in-service teachers training system and
implemented nation-wide to improve foundational learning for Zambian children. Further, it would
be useful to train additional teachers from every primary school to respond to Catch-Up teacher
vacancy owing to transfers, promotion, attrition, etc. A useful approach to ensure the sustainability
of Catch-Up training sessions would be to include them in the existing School-Based Continuing
Professional Development (SBCPD) or School Programme of In-service Training for the Term
(SPRINT). (3-5 years)
• Creative and innovative aspects of the Catch-Up methodology reportedly generated the greatest
interest among learners. Going forward, the training programmes for the teachers on the Catch-Up
methodology must lay emphasis on the two aspects and include additional training sessions on
strengthening them. Further, a teachers’ learning platform may be created where teachers share
their innovative ideas and learn from each other’s practices and utilise new teaching methods in
their Catch-Up and mainstream classes. (1-2 years)
• If MoE plans to institutionalise the programme and implement it at the national level, it is important
for the Ministry to secure funding for activities, such as continued training, mentoring and
monitoring of the programme. In addition to aid agencies, MoE could explore mobilising funds
from corporates, large foundations, etc. (3-5 years)
• To implement the Catch-Up programme better, it is recommended that participating teachers be
duly recognized and kept motivated. Cost effective ways of recognition, such as, certificates of
appreciation and other non-monetary incentives would go a long way in sustaining the sense of
pride among the teachers. (1-2 years)
• Some teachers indicated the high pupil teacher ratio (PTR) as one of the challenges in the effective
implementation of Catch-Up programme. World Bank data from 2017 puts the PTR for primary
grades in Zambia at 42. However, in several instances, the classrooms included 80–100 learners,
making it difficult for the teacher to give personalised attention to learners. Recruitment of teachers
coupled with their deployment as per the needs of the school needs to be considered. Further, a
mapping of teachers may be useful to identify schools with excess teachers, if any. These teachers
may then be deployed to schools facing a shortage of teachers. (3-5 years)
The recommendations for the future of the Catch-Up programme and improvement of the programme
implementation show the importance of securing funding. The Ministry should be able to support
teacher recruitment, training and compensation; transport for monitoring; materials for teaching and
learning; school feeding and so on if the programme is to be continued or expanded. Equally important
is the need to implement the necessary policy level changes to mainstream the TaRL methodology in
the teacher training curriculum. Further, the COVID19 pandemic has led to forced closure of schools
which in turn has resulted in learning losses for learners. Going forward, it would be useful if MoGE
develops a plan to ensure continuity of learning during similar circumstances.

Chapter 8. Lessons learned
The Catch-Up programme is perceived in Zambia as a powerful tool to improve foundational learning
of young learners. During the implementation of the programme, the programme partners managed
many challenges faced at every stage of the programme and achieved the programme objectives. In the
interviews, the stakeholders identified the key lessons learned from the programme, which may be
significant for other education programmes as well.
The biggest lesson is the importance of partnership with MoGE and its system at all levels. The
engagement of the Ministry enabled the other programme partners to make decisions and to draft action
plans jointly. This ensured that the Ministry developed ownership of the programme from the beginning
and led it with the full support from the partners. The programme was effective because the Ministry
adopted it and accepted it. The Ministry took the programme as a low cost and effective solution for
addressing learning gaps in the country. The assessment tools and pedagogy used by the Catch-Up
approach are easy to implement at the school level and do not require a high level of expertise. The
simplicity and the quick turnaround of results helped the Ministry develop a buy-in for the programme.
Thus, the catch-up approach has been different from any other interventions where the net impact fades
away with the passage of time. This approach aims to ultimately build a sustainable programme. As a
result, most of the survey participants and the key informants concluded that the programme would be
sustainable without external support in future, especially in the schools that had implemented the
programme from the beginning. Hence, the leadership from the Ministry, effective partnerships and
sustained efforts at training and monitoring the programme are some of the key takeaways, which if
followed in other programmes can be equally effective.
Effective communication among the stakeholders contributed significantly to the success of the
programme. The key factor in effective communication was the use of information to help programme
implementation. For example, during monitoring activities the stakeholders did not only focus on
reviewing the programme but also on sharing the information to improve its performance. In this
manner, ongoing course correction was applied throughout the programme to ensure that it worked
perfectly within the Zambian context.
Prompt response to the changing environment was one of the key lessons learned from the programme.
Since early 2020, amid the COVID19 pandemic, the programme partners quickly changed some of the
core activities by conducting them online rather than in the face to face mode. Most of physical meetings
were replaced by virtual ones. Orientations and trainings were organised in online mode.

Purpose of the Study
Greetings! My name is ___________________________. I am a part of the survey team working with ACER
India. We are here to study the implementation of Catch-Up Scale up programme in Zambia for remedial learning
of learners. Under this approach, the learners are taught as per their ability and not their grade level. This study
has been commissioned by UNICEF and supported by the Ministry of General Education (MoGE). It is being
administered to assess the progress of the programme against its intended objective, which are:
1. To assess the extent to which the programme is achieving its objective of improving literacy and numeracy
skills for all learners and for those further behind.
2. To assess the extent to which the programme is being implemented as designed including effectiveness of
partnerships and sustainability mechanisms.
3. To assess the minimal cost required to implement the Catch-Up Programme, while still maintaining
effectiveness.
4. To assess the enablers/factors contributing to the implementation of the Catch-Up programme.
Confidentiality
All information generated as a result of the observation will be kept confidential. Once the study is finished, the
list of names with your contact information and the completed surveys will be destroyed.
Benefits
Research helps society by providing new knowledge. You may not benefit directly from this study. However, the
findings will be important to improve pupils’ learning outcomes.

Purpose of the Study
Greetings! My name is ___________________________. I am a part of the survey team working with ACER
India. We are here to study the implementation of Catch-Up Scale up programme in Zambia for remedial learning
of learners. Under this approach, the learners are taught as per their ability and not their grade level. This study
has been commissioned by UNICEF and supported by the Ministry of General Education (MoGE). It is being
administered to assess the progress of the programme against its intended objective, which are:
1. To assess the extent to which the programme is achieving its objective of improving literacy and numeracy
skills for all learners and for those further behind.
2. To assess the extent to which the programme is being implemented as designed including effectiveness of
partnerships and sustainability mechanisms.
3. To assess the minimal cost required to implement the Catch-Up Programme, while still maintaining
effectiveness.
4. To assess the enablers/factors contributing to the implementation of the Catch-Up programme.
Confidentiality
All of the answers you give will be confidential and will not be shared with anyone other than members of our
study team. At the end of the study, we will put all the answers together and make a report. Once the study is
finished, the list of names with your contact information and the completed surveys will be destroyed.
