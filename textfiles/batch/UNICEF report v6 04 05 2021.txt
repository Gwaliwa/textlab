Introduction
v
it This report presents the findings of an evaluation of UNICEF’s modelling activity, which
u
c was commissioned by UNICEF to support their work to test and scale-up models.
e
x Modelling means piloting an intervention in new contexts to demonstrate its replicability
E
and effectiveness1. Between 2016-2020 UNICEF initiated or continued to develop a
number of models in the areas of health, child protection, education and adolescent
wellbeing. A set of 10 necessary conditions or ‘Sine Qua Non’ (SQN) for modelling is
intended to guide this work.
In this evaluation, modelling was examined through five exemplar models, each at a
different stage in modelling and work towards scale-up:
• Family Outreach Worker (FOW): an intensive family support service for families
with children with multiple and complex needs, intended to improve the capacity
of families to support children’s development and to avoid out-of-home care.
Modelling took place from 2013-18 in Belgrade, Novi Sad, Kragujevac and Niš.
Delivery ceased after the end of modelling except in Novi Sad. Amendments to
legislation required to take the model to national scale have been drafted but not
adopted.
• Intermittent Foster Care (IFC): periodic family-based respite care for children with
disabilities, to support families and improve care for children, and connect
families and children with their local community. The model was implemented in
2015-2016 in Novi Sad, Belgrade, Kragujevac and Nis by regional Centres for
Foster Care and Adoption, working with Centres for Social Work.
The amendments to law required for scale-up have been drafted but not enacted.
The model continues to be used in Novi Sad, and elsewhere some families from
1 Terms of Reference for this evaluation- see Annex 1
1 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
the modelling period continue to be supported. Regulatory amendments have
been drafted but as with FOW delivery has largely ceased.
• Diversionary Measures (DM): a form of restorative justice, diverting children from
criminal sanctions to rehabilitative activity. It is intended to protect the best
interests of children, reduce reoffending rates, and reduce the burden on the
legal system. DMs were enacted in law in 2006 but are not widely used, and
modelling was undertaken between 2015-19 in Belgrade, Novi Sad, Kragujevac
and Niš initially, then also in priority areas chosen from areas with highest juvenile
crime including: Paraćin, Zrenjanin, Sombor, Sjenica, Jagodina, Kraljevo, Batočina,
Kruševac, Aranđelovac and Novi Pazar2.
• Early Childhood Intervention (ECI): a transdisciplinary, family-centred programme
delivered by teams of professionals from across public health, pre-school
education and social welfare. It is intended to provide early identification of
children with developmental delay, and early intervention including through
home visits. This is the newest model, with modelling and evaluation ongoing. It is
being fully implemented in Leskovac, Kragujevac, Niš, Sremska Mitrovica and
Belgrade (Rakovica municipality), and partially implemented in Čukarica and New
Belgrade.
• Dropout Prevention Programme (DOP): designed to prevent children’s non-
attendance at school, the model involves an assessment tool to identify children
at risk, capacity building for schools, and planning and provision of preventive
support. DOP was modelled between 2016-18 in in Vrbas, Kraljevo, Kragujevac
Pancevo, Bela Palanka, Surdulica and Vladicin Han, and dropout prevention
activity has been adopted in law and scaled-up nationally, although not yet with
the full support UNICEF judge to be needed. DOP was subsequently included in a
three-year programme addressing child marriage, currently in the process of
external evaluation.
The objectives of the evaluation were to assess approaches to modelling (including use of
the SQN), identify barriers and enablers to scale-up, and make recommendations to help
the Serbian Country Office to strengthen modelling, and to optimise or scale-up the
models. The primary audience for the evaluation is UNICEF Country Office staff in Serbia.
The evaluation involved:
• an inception mission and inception report
• development of a theory of change for modelling
• extensive document review
• six individual or group interviews with UNICEF teams and leaders and 40
interviews with stakeholders
• a small survey of local implementation sites
• and analysis of financial systems including a small number of interviews with key
informants.
The evaluation used an analytical framework, the UNICEF Scale-up Framework, which is a
synthesis of the evidence on the necessary steps, strategies and determinants for effective
scale-up. The UNICEF Scale-up Framework sets out, based on this evidence, what needs to
have been achieved by the end of the modelling process. It has four domains: a
programme which has been optimised (improved and fully prepared) for scale-up; is

2 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
supported by evidence: fits the delivery context and wider context, and where essential
stakeholders are committed to supporting scale-up. These four domains form the key
analytical framework that was applied in this evaluation of UNICEF’s approach to
modelling. The four domains, and the analysis of modelling against them, provide the main
structure of the findings section of the report (chapters 3-6).
Social, political and economic context
During the last two decades, Serbia has significantly improved the legal and policy
framework for combatting discrimination, social exclusion and gender inequality.
Challenges remain, particularly in access to education and the high use of institutionalised
care.
Despite efforts to de-centralise responsibility for social protection, education and health,
central government has by far the largest role in financing these areas. The new Law on
the Planning System and draft Strategy for Social Protection Development involve some
limited reform to the public policy framework for social protection. The fiscal strategy for
2021 does not suggest planned increases in social protection expenditure, and continued
fiscal restraint is likely. Levels of transparency in fiscal decision-making and public
participation are low, which highlights the complexities of intervening to influence financial
allocation.
Findings
Did modelling result in an optimised programme?
Systematic approaches were taken to initiating and designing each of the five models,
using for example situational analysis, discussions with families and professionals, review
of international programmes and delivery systems as well as drawing on UNICEF staff
expertise. Government commitment to modelling was secured at an early stage, alongside
extensive consultation and partnership work with other stakeholders. UNICEF was viewed
by the stakeholders interviewed as an energetic and active leader of modelling. Modelling
generated high levels of enthusiasm among the stakeholders and partners involved.
Many of the elements and resources that need to be in place to support scale-up had been
developed for the five exemplar models by the end of the modelling period. There were
some gaps for example in whether all models had an equity-based theory of change,
clearly specified essential and adaptable practices and fidelity criteria, and assessment of
costs.
Did modelling build the evidence base?
For a model to be ready for scale-up, there needs to be robust evidence about what it
takes to implement the model, effectiveness (i.e. the extent to which intended outcomes
are achieved), and cost-effectiveness. Review of evaluation reports and other documents
showed that significant evidence was generated through evaluation of the models. All the
models (with the exception of ECI where the evaluation had not yet been put in place) had
some evidence about implementation. The quality of evidence about outcomes was
strongest for DOP, which was the only model where evaluation had involved a quasi-
experimental design and objective outcome measures. There was evidence about cost-
effectiveness for FOW and IFC.
Did modelling result in a programme that fits the context?
All five models were viewed by stakeholders as relevant and credible. They were seen as
addressing high-priority needs, and having clear added value.
3 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
All five of the exemplar models were intended to improve, reform or change the system in
which they operate. This inevitably creates some tension in their fit within delivery
organisations and the wider system of e.g. policy, finance, legislation, regulations, other
services, professional paradigms and established ways of working, and community cultures
and preferences. Despite the positive regard for the models, stakeholder interviews
identified areas where the models are not fully aligned with operating contexts. These
included the intensity of interventions being over-ambitious for the capacity of delivery
organisations, the need for intersectoral cooperation (i.e. support from other services and
organisations) that was not always available, models being ahead of professional and
socio-cultural norms, and the need for changes to legislation or regulation to incorporate
models into mandated and funded practice.
Has modelling secured commitment to scale-up?
There was an agreed target and pathway for all the models (with the exception of ECI
where this work is ongoing). The necessary policy, legislation and regulation changes had
been made for DM and DOP, and draft amendments to legislation and regulation agreed
and not yet actioned for FOW and IFC. There was not yet government commitment to
funding the models and their support at scale.
UNICEF was viewed by stakeholders interviewed as having strong relationships with
government and other key bodies and was highly regarded for its professional expertise
and wisdom. However, government had not yet committed to what UNICEF personnel
regarded as the full set of legislative, regulatory and financial requirements, for any of the
models.
Stakeholders encouraged UNICEF to continue with and amplify direct government
advocacy, but also to recognise and support other organisations that can advocate to
government. UNICEF was also encouraged to place more emphasis on mobilising social
and professional movements in support of change. UNICEF’s political advocacy includes
financial advocacy but review of UNICEF’s planning instruments found no references to
specifically influencing government financial allocation for any of the models.
Discussion
Readiness for scale-up of the exemplar models
All the exemplar models have good potential to address equity issues and secure
improvements to children’s rights and wellbeing. To realise that potential, each of the
models needs continued work to increase the readiness of delivery organisation and wider
systems for the model, and to optimise the model to improve its fit and feasibility.
• The FOW appears to be viable for scale-up through residential institutions
repurposed as Child and Family Centres. Further testing and optimisation of FOW
in this new delivery setting would be needed.
• Similarly, IFC could viably be scaled-up. Once the necessary regulations are in
place and financial allocation agreed, further testing of IFC would be needed to
review fit within the new regulatory framework.
• DMs are enacted in law, and UNICEF’s work has helped to build service and
system readiness somewhat. To reach children and young people at scale, there is
a need for significant expansion in available rehabilitative activities. This, and
building social and professional acceptability of restorative justice approaches,
should be the focus for UNICEF’s continued work.
4 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
• The ECI model is at an early stage of implementation and evaluation. A phased,
iterative approach will be needed to scale-up, with incremental changes to the
model alongside strengthening the readiness of delivery organisations and the
wider system, avoiding scaling-up until the necessary infrastructure is in place.
• Modelling achieved significant successes with DOP, demonstrating a viable
approach and securing dropout prevention as an issue to be included in individual
education plans. However further work is needed to embed DOP and improve the
quality and comprehensiveness of school prevention work.
OECD/DAC criteria: relevance, efficiency and sustainability
The five exemplar models were seen as relevant to beneficiaries’ needs and in line with
many partners’ priorities, but there was more mixed evidence about their relevance to
national policies and priorities. In terms of efficiency, UNICEF’s approach to modelling is
strong and no clear alternative approaches emerged in the evaluation, but modelling
needs to be widened and strengthened to achieve the intended results, as discussed
further below. The evidence for sustainability is also mixed, since only DOP has yet been
scaled-up.
Strengthening modelling
UNICEF’s approach to modelling could be strengthened in a number of ways. The systems
change ambitions behind each model could be more clearly set out and an integrated
portfolio of work planned encompassing modelling, advocacy and communications. The
design of models needs to be closer to the capabilities of the current system, with more
robust testing of implementation and fit, iterative cycles of work to improve the
performance of the service system, and developing the complexity and demands of
models gradually in line with this.
UNICEF makes a significant commitment to evaluation, but there is scope to strengthen
the robustness of implementation, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness evaluation. There
is also scope to sharpen the focus on gender in model development, monitoring and
evaluation.
The evidence points to a need for UNICEF to make its financial advocacy more targeted
and aligned with government fiscal planning calendar, and based on credible costs
analysis. There is also a need to extend advocacy and communication activity. Finally,
planning and governance needs to be adapted to document the wider systems change
ambition and wider portfolio or work required to address it. Monitoring approaches need
to document not only whether the intended work was undertaken but also whether the
desired results were achieved, with the expectation that systems change and scale-up
involved dynamic, adaptive and non-linear approaches.
Conclusions, lessons learnt and recommendations
UNICEF’s approach to modelling has led to a set of models that are well-regarded and have
potential for improving children’s outcomes at scale. The approaches taken to initiating
modelling are systematic and included securing the involvement and participation of
appropriate stakeholders. Many of the necessary elements of models have been
developed. There are some weaknesses in approaches to modelling, particularly in the fit
of models to operational and systems capacity and the extent to which all necessarily
commitments to scale-up have been achieved. The implications are that UNICEF needs to
strengthen its work particularly in improving systems and their readiness for the models
and influencing government priorities, in support of modelling.
5 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
In summary, the lessons learnt are that UNICEF is well positioned to build on modelling;
scaling up requires more attention to the fit between models and the current service
system; this requires extended and integrated activity at model and system level, and
UNICEF should develop its capacity for advocacy, communication, soft influencing, political
analysis, evaluation and economic analysis.
Eight recommendations are made:
1. Create a comprehensive and integrated scale-up plan for each area of systems change:
Behind each model is a wider systems improvement and change ambition. However,
this ambition is not clearly set out nor visible in plans, and is not explicitly agreed with
partners and stakeholders as the basis for modelling work. UNICEF needs to set out the
ambition and ensure that for each model there is a comprehensive scale-up plan to
achieve it. The plan should articulate the intended end goal, the social and systems
level change sought, and a pathway and integrated set of activities to change it which
includes not only modelling but also advocacy, research and communications. The plan
should be developed with partners, and commitment secured from partners to it,
rather than only to modelling activity. Annual work plans need to be agreed with all
relevant ministries, not just the lead ministry. In this way the change ambition and the
work required to secure it will be transparent to all stakeholders, the commitment
required will be clear, and weak or absent commitment will be visible more quickly.
2. Design models that are closer to the current system capacity:
Because UNICEF’s ambition is systems reform, the models are designed to
demonstrate what a future improved system could achieve. This creates barriers to
scale up, since the system conditions and supported needed for scale-up are not fully
present. UNICEF needs to design models that are closer to the capacity of the current
system (i.e. the professional, operational, organisational and strategic capacity of
agencies involved in implementation). This requires UNICEF to undertake risk and
assumptions analysis, systematically identifying where the system is not sufficiently
mature to sustain models, and planning work to improve the system.
3. Identify where UNICEF’s work needs to stimulate change in social norms and
behaviours, and plan work to achieve this:
The models are also somewhat in advance of social attitudes, norms and behaviours in
their expectations and grounding (for example, ambitions for inclusion of disabled
children, or for restorative justice approaches). UNICEF needs to identify where
changes in social norms and behaviours are required to address root causes of
problems addressed by models, to build demand, or to create the conditions for
sustainable change. There needs to be more emphasis on building and mobilising social
movements. Communications and knowledge dissemination plans need to be aligned
with modelling plans to support this.
4. Improve the monitoring of achievements against the scale-up plan:
UNICEF’s planning documents do not currently reflect the full range of work needed to
secure scale-up, and monitoring is narrowly focused on whether intended actions have
been undertaken rather than monitoring progress towards scale-up. UNICEF needs to
improve its monitoring to assess regularly whether the necessary conditions and
capabilities for systems change are being developed, and where there remains
resistance and barriers. UNICEF also needs to plan for multiple scenarios and expect
non-linear progress. This requires a more dynamic, adaptive way of working where
plans are regularly reviewed, adapted, and additional work built in, or stages of work
repeated, as necessary.

5. Improve the robustness of evaluation and its use to improve model:
Although UNICEF invests considerably in evidence generation, it needs to improve the
robustness of both implementation evaluation and effectiveness evaluation.
Implementation evaluation needs to involve more rigorous analysis of implementation
strategies, barriers and enablers, and to be focused on the aspects of implementation
that are known to be determinants of programme effectiveness. Effectiveness and
outcomes evaluations need to be more rigorous, including using comparative designs
(so that impacts can be robustly attributed to models), validated outcome measures,
and measuring longer term outcomes across aspects of child wellbeing. Existing
international evidence can also be used to make the case, where effectiveness
evidence is not yet available. Cost-effectiveness evaluations need to be undertaken. A
phased approach is needed, with research questions proportionate to modelling phase.
This evidence needs to be used to improve models to increase fit and effectiveness,
strengthen implementation strategies, and increase readiness for scale-up. It would
also highlight where a model has limited chance of success.
6. Strengthen political advocacy, skills and efforts:
Political commitment to the models is not yet fully secured. UNICEF needs to bring
advocacy and modelling work into closer alignment so that they work to the same
objectives and plans. UNICEF should continue to develop political analysis and
influencing skills of Country Office staff in programme, advocacy and communications
teams. UNICEF Country Office also needs to strengthen its initial and ongoing analysis
of political contexts, priorities and drivers, and the adaptation of work to align with this
analysis. There is a need to amplify and diversify approaches to advocacy, both
advocating directly to government and working indirectly through other institutions,
individuals, coalitions and social movements. Senior leaders at UNICEF need to play a
key role in advocacy efforts.
7. Target and strengthen financial analysis and advocacy to influence allocation of
government and public financing:
Financial commitment to the models has not yet been fully secured. Financial advocacy
is embedded in other advocacy work but there is scope for it to be better attuned to
political financial strategies. UNICEF needs to strengthen its financial advocacy to
influence the allocation of government and public funding, in support of models. This
needs to be part of the work of Country Office leadership and programme and
advocacy team, and clearly represented in UNICEF’s planning instruments. UNICEF
needs to set out a costed business case for investment in modelling and scale-up,
based on stronger financial analysis of both current public financing and of the cost-
effectiveness of models. Robust costed project proposals need to be put to
government at key points in the government financial decision-making calendar
between January and the end of August, with representations made at multiple levels
in relevant ministries including to Ministers, Ministerial Assistants, State Secretaries
and advisers as well as through other agencies with influence. The format or
instrument for these representations is less important than the strength of business
case made and its alignment with government priorities. The aim should be to ensure
that spending commitments are included in both the final budget and in the
government-wide annual work plan. Government financial commitment should also be
documented in the annual work plans between UNICEF and each ministry, as well as
UNICEF’s financial commitment.
8. Strengthen the focus on gender in model development, piloting and planning for scale-
up:
UNICEF’s modelling is strongly oriented to addressing equity gaps and disadvantage.
However there is scope to bring a stronger emphasis to gender in particular. This would
involve: understanding gendered experiences and causes of the need addressed (e.g.
school dropout), addressing these in model design and content, targeted strategies to
7 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
reach the boys and girls most in need, analysis of service barriers to effectively meeting
the needs of boys and girls, understanding and addressing gendered assumptions and
behaviours among staff, monitoring the reach to boys and girls and their satisfaction
with and outcomes from the service, and adapting the model as needed to address
gender issues identified. Better data on gendered differences in need, participation
and outcomes is key to this.

Chapter summary
• The current evaluation is an evaluation of UNICEF’s modelling activity to support the
scaling-up of effective interventions. Modelling means piloting an intervention in new
contexts to demonstrate its replicability and effectiveness. Modelling was examined
through five exemplar interventions or ‘models’.
• The evaluation involved an inception mission and development of a theory of change
for modelling, extensive document review, interviews with UNICEF teams and leaders,
40 interviews with stakeholders, a small survey of local implementation sites, and
analysis of potential funding sources for activity involved in scaling-up.
• The evaluation used an analytical framework, the UNICEF Scale-up Framework, which
is a synthesis of the evidence on the necessary steps, strategies and determinants for
effective scale-up. It establishes what UNICEF needs to have achieved by the end of
the modelling process under four headings: Optimised programme, Evidence based,
Fit for context, and Secured commitment.

The processes of piloting and modelling are a key strategy of
UNICEF within the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region4.
Piloting is defined by UNICEF as testing a new theory of change
to assess whether an approach could be effective. Modelling is
defined as demonstrating that the intervention works in a new context, to promote
replication and encourage adoption by others5. In practice, the current evaluation of
modelling found that these stages (piloting vs modelling) are not distinguished from each
other, and the early work to develop and test programmes is regarded by the UNICEF
teams as part of modelling – see further discussion in Annex 2.
UNICEF have launched a significant number of models between 2016-2020 in the areas of
health, child protection, education and adolescent wellbeing. The process of modelling is
intended to provide information about the effectiveness and feasibility of wide-scale
implementation, and to be an advocacy tool in efforts to secure the resources and
partnerships need for scale up and sustainability of the models. It is also intended to
increase ownership and buy-in from stakeholders. A theory of change for modelling was
developed as part of this evaluation, based on interviews with UNICEF teams, and is also
included in Annex 2.
In 2014 UNICEF developed consensus about the necessary conditions for modelling, based
on discussions between Deputy Representatives in all Country Offices (CO) and the
Regional Office of the Central and Eastern Europe and Commonwealth of Independent
States region. These are articulated as ten ‘Sine Qua Non’ (SQN) and are shown in chapter
2.
1.2. Objectives of this evaluation
The Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia was an external, independent
evaluation that undertook a rapid assessment of modelling as carried out by the UNICEF
Country Office (CO) in Serbia between 2016- 2020. The purpose of the evaluation was to
inform future strategic directions and provide recommendations to UNICEF at both the

country and regional levels. The evaluation was conducted by the Centre for Evidence and
Implementation (CEI) in partnership with SeConS Development Initiative Group (SeConS).
The objectives of the evaluation (with a small amendment made to those set out in the
Terms of Reference (ToR)6 - see Annex 1) are:
• To evaluate and assess the extent to which selected models have been designed
in accordance with the SQN
• Assess and identify implementation barriers and enablers to scale up of the
models in the context of Serbia's Government systems and structures
• As compared to alternative strategies, assess the extent to which modelling was
the most efficient way of achieving the desired results
• Make recommendations that will help the Serbia Country Office optimise
modelling as a strategy in its next country programme
• Make specific recommendations that will help UNICEF optimise, replicate or
scale-up the sampled models where feasible
• Assess the sufficiency of the SQN as a framework for guiding UNICEF’s modelling
efforts at the country level.
During the inception phase of the project, the objectives were developed into a detailed
set of evaluation questions, shown in Table 1. Against each question is an indication of its
relationship with the OECD DAC evaluation criteria7. The table also shows where in the
report each is addressed.

6 Following recommendations made by reviewers of the Inception Report and agreed by UNICEF, two
objectives in the ToR were combined into the second objective set out above. The original objectives as set
out in the ToR were: ‘Assess and identify implementation challenges that hindered or supported scale-up of
the models’ and ‘Looking forward, assess the factors that may facilitate or further impede scale up in the
context specific to Serbia's Government systems and structures (particularly in the areas of governance and
financing) in the next programme cycle (2021-2025)’. Reviewers recommended the combined and briefer
version of the objective to reduce duplication and increase coherence.

The main OECD DAC evaluation criteria addressed are ‘efficiency’ and ‘sustainability’.
Efficiency, defined6 as ‘the extent to which the intervention delivers, or is likely to deliver,
results in an economic and timely way’, is relevant to evaluation questions relating to how
UNICEF approaches modelling, and how it addresses financing and costing as part of
modelling. Sustainability, defined as ‘the extent which the net benefits of the intervention
12 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
continue, or are likely to continue’ is the key goal of UNICEF’s scale-up work, relating to
the continuation of implementation and impacts after the end of the modelling period. It is
relevant to evaluation questions relating to whether modelling has led to national scale-up
and whether the models are sustainable and scalable. One evaluation question – how
UNICEF chooses and initiates investment in modelling – relates to relevance, defined as
‘the extent to which the intervention objectives and design respond to beneficiaries,
global, country and partner/institution needs, policies and priorities, and continue to do so
if circumstances change’.
Modelling, as a concept and process, is the object of the evaluation. It was explored in the
evaluation through five exemplar models. The selected models provide a broad
representation of UNICEF team, service area, policy area, lead Ministry, and current stage
of scale-up. A brief description of each of the five exemplar models is provided in Table 1..
More detail on each model is provided in Annex 3.
Table 1.2 The five exemplar models
Family The Family Outreach Worker service is an intensive family support service which
Outreach aims to improve the capacities of families to support children’s development in a
Worker family environment, providing safety and protection from neglect and abuse. It is
(FOW) intended for families with children with multiple and complex needs; families
where there is a risk of the child being taken into care; and families planning for the
reintegration of the child after a period in care. Family Support Workers based in
residential care institutions, supported by Centres for Social Work, met weekly with
parents and coordinated other support services, for up to 12 months. Modelling
took place from 2013-18 in four municipalities: Belgrade, Novi Sad, Kragujevac and
Niš.
The model has not been scaled up. Delivery ceased after the end of modelling
except in Novi Sad. Amendments to legislation required to take the model to
national scale have been drafted but not adopted. The scale-up pathway will be to
embed FOW in the work of new Centres for Children and Families
Intermittent The Intermittent Foster Care service supports periodic, family-based respite care
Foster Care for children with disabilities. The service aims to support families, provide high
(IFC) quality care for children, connect children and families with support and
resources in their local community, and aid community integration. Support is
provided by the Centre for Social Work and the Centre for Foster Care and
Adoption. The model was implemented in 2015-2016 in four municipalities
(Novi Sad, Belgrade, Kragujevac and Niš) by regional Centres for Foster Care and
Adoption, working with Centres for Social Work.
The model has not been scaled up. The amendments to by-law required for
scale-up have been drafted but not enacted. The model continues to be used in
Novi Sad, and elsewhere some families from the modelling period continue to be
supported. The intended pathway is to embed IFC in foster care provision
Diversionary Diversionary measures are a form of restorative justice, diverting children from
measures criminal sanctions to rehabilitative activity in the community. The approach is
(DM) intended to protect the best interests of children, reducing the number exposed
to prolonged judicial proceedings, reduce reoffending rates and decrease the
burden on the legal system. Diversionary measures had been enacted in 2006
but were seldom used. They are ordered by either judiciary or prosecutors, and
rehabilitative activity is provided by Centres for Social Work or other local
providers. Modelling involved training and capacity building for key actors
working within the justice and social welfare systems and was implemented in
2015-2017 in four municipalities: Belgrade, Novi Sad, Kragujevac and Niš.
In 2018-2019 this work was expanded to municipalities in Serbia with the highest
juvenile offending rates where local authorities had expressed commitment to
13 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
invest in and sustain diversionary schemes. The indicative list was Paraćin,
Zrenjanin, Sombor, Sjenica, Jagodina, Kraljevo, Batočina, Kruševac, Aranđelovac
and Novi Pazar.8
DMs are enacted in law but the approach is still not fully scaled-up. UNICEF and
partners are currently establishing work in seven further areas to promote the
use of diversionary measures. Periodic ongoing capacity building and training
continues in many of these regions.
Early The Early Childhood Intervention model (ECI) is the newest of the exemplar
Childhood models, recently developed by UNICEF with stakeholders across the health,
Intervention education and social welfare sectors. It is being fully implemented in Leskovac,
(ECI) Kragujevac, Niš, Sremska Mitrovica and Belgrade (Rakovica municipality), and
partially implemented in Čukarica and New Belgrade. It is a transdisciplinary,
family centred programme delivered by teams of professionals from across
public health, pre-school education and welfare institutions. Its aims are the
early identification of children aged 0-5 years with learning delays and disabilities
and provision of intensive early intervention including through family visits.
Eligible children are screened by paediatricians in Paediatric departments at
Primary Health Centre (PHC), and referred to the intersectoral ECI team,
coordinated through Development Counselling Unit at PHC. Provision of support
to children and their families is delivered through home visits and visits at
kindergarten, including support for transition (ending ECI program, transition
from home to pre-school, to school or to other services/programs).
The model is at an early stage of modelling, which will include evaluation and
determining the appropriate delivery service or services for scale-up. Pathway to
scale is not yet determined
Dropout The Dropout Prevention model is designed to prevent children’s non-attendance
Prevention at school. The model involves an assessment tool to identify at risk students,
(DOP) capacity building for teachers and schools, and development of individual
education plans for each child, providing cross-sector support as needed. The
model was implemented in 2014-2016, in 4 primary and 6 secondary vocational
schools in 7 municipalities: Vrbas, Kraljevo, Kragujevac, Pancevo, Bela Palanka,
Surdulica and Vladicin Han.
The requirement for schools to incorporate dropout prevention activities into
individual education plans has been adopted into law and scaled-up nationally
(the intended pathways to scale) although without the level of implementation
support and resourcing for schools that UNICEF judged necessary for the DOP
model to be fully effective.
Each of the models is part of a wider programme of work, illustrated in Annex 4 by the
Country Programme 2016-2020 theory of change. In 2015, UNICEF developed its Country
Programme Document (CPD) jointly with government partners for the period 2016-
2020. The CPD was designed to be aligned with key government strategies, notably the EU
accession process, the sustainable development goals, and UNICEF’s Strategic Plan 2014-
2017. The CPD 2016-2020 is to a large extent a continuation of strategies endorsed by the
previous Country Programme and the comprehensive Mid-Term Review conducted in
2013.
The overall goal of the Country Programme is to support the efforts of Serbia to promote
and protect the rights of all children and to give all children equal opportunities to
reach their full potential. The Programme focuses on supporting vulnerable children
from the very start of life and enhancing the social welfare system’s capacity to prevent
vulnerable families from falling below the poverty line. UNICEF strategies for unlocking
bottlenecks to the realisation of child rights include advocacy, partnership, leveraging
8 Indicative list outlined in the UNICEF Country document: A Second Chance for Juvenile Offenders in
Serbia (N.D.)
14 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
resources, capacity development, evidence generation and modelling/piloting innovative
solutions.
The primary audience for and intended users of the report are UNICEF Country Office staff
in Serbia. Secondary audiences are UNICEF Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia,
UNICEF headquarters, the government of Serbia including line ministries and state bodies,
and other stakeholders involved in modelling and scale-up. The ultimate beneficiaries are
the rights holders who benefit, or could benefit, from the models. The intended uses of
the evaluation are:
• For learning about and improved decision-making in modelling and scale-up
• To inform scale-up strategies for the exemplar models including the work of
government and other partners
• To identify lessons learned and good practice for national, regional and other
stakeholders already implementing or interested in applying modelling.
The scope of the evaluation reflects the ToR and decisions made during the inception
period and documented in the inception report, particularly the focus on the five
exemplars, and the chronology reflecting the periods of modelling for them. The remit of
the evaluation did not extend to reviewing existing data sources on the scale of delivery of
those models still being implemented, nor to primary data collection on these points. The
evaluation relied on information from previous reports. The remit also did not extend to
include other models, and areas of activity not identified as being part of the modelling
process.
1.3. Evaluation methods
1.3.1. Evaluation methodology
The evaluation is not a conventional evaluation of a single model, but a formative
evaluation of the process of modelling as undertaken by the Serbia Country Office, using
the five exemplar models. It does not therefore focus on the impacts of the models
themselves, but on the impacts of modelling as a process.
The key element of the evaluation methodology is the use of implementation science.
Implementation science is the study of methods to promote the adoption and integration
of evidence-informed practices, interventions, programmes and policies into routine care
and service settings to improve population outcomes, and covers programme design,
piloting, implementation and scale-up. This includes an extensive body of published, peer-
reviewed literature about what it takes to scale-up programmes, the barriers and
challenges involved, effective strategies, and the determinants of effective scale-up. It
addresses the challenges of moving from small-scale delivery in idealised and tightly
managed conditions, to scale up through existing systems, structures and resources. This
evidence establishes what is required for effective scale-up and is therefore a key resource
used in the evaluation. The analysis of modelling is situated within this wider evidence of
‘what works’ in modelling and scaling-up interventions.
Implementation science was operationalised in the evaluation in two ways. First, the
published evidence on what works in scaling-up was synthesised, and the synthesis used to
build the analytical framework (the ‘UNICEF Scale-up Framework) against which each of
the models was assessed. An analytical framework synthesising evidence about what
works in scaling-up is required to address several of the evaluation questions set out in
Table 1 above:
15 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
• What is emerging as consensus internationally as the important stages and
strategies required and determinants of successful scale up?
• How do these relate to the context of UNICEF’s programs in Serbia including
consideration of gender perspectives and achievement of equity- and child rights-
based impact?
• Are these stages, strategies and determinants addressed in the sampled models’
design and in the approaches taken to modelling?
A framework based on synthesis of the international evidence is also needed to address
other evaluation questions:
• Is the SQN a useful and sufficient framework for guiding UNICEF’s modelling
efforts?
• How are the stages, strategies and determinants of effective scaling reflected in
the SQN?
• What if anything is missing or could be strengthened to provide a framework for
modelling for scale-up that includes the achievement of equity- and child rights-
based impact?
• What are the key criteria for assessing the feasibility of the sampled models for
scale-up?
• How feasible are the sampled models for scale-up?
• For those considered feasible for scale-up, what would scale up involve in the
context specific to Serbia’s Government systems and structures (particularly in
the areas of governance and financing) in the next program cycle?
The most robust approach to addressing these questions is by explicit reference to
evidence from implementation science. Alternative strategies, such as addressing them by
reference to UNICEF teams’ plans, or by reference to the views and perceptions of
stakeholders without a particular analytical framework, or by reference to the SQN, would
lack rigour and objectivity. The SQN was therefore not used as a primary framework for
the evaluation.
The second way in which implementation science is used in the evaluation is in the
recognition that a pre-condition for scale-up is an implementable model. The key
determinants of effective implementation are summarised in a number of syntheses or
frameworks, of which one of the best tested is the Consolidated Framework for
Implementation Research (CFIR).9 CFIR identifies the determinants of effective
implementation as being:
• The innovation: its complexity, adaptability, costs and other factors
• The staff involved in implementation: their beliefs, attitudes, knowledge and skills
• The inner organisational context for implementation: including factors such as
capacity, leadership and usual work

16 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
• The outer environmental context: policy, funding, legislation etc.
• The implementation process itself: the processes and resources required for
effective implementation.
CFIR informed the design of research instruments that were used in research with local
implementation sites – see further below.
The evaluation used a mixed-methods approach. Documentary analysis was used to collate
information about the models, the approach to and findings from evaluation, and planning
and governance tools and how they were used, and to provide wider context. Qualitative
research with UNICEF personnel and stakeholders was used to provide flexible exploration
of the processes involved in modelling, and flexible application of the key evaluation
criteria, in ways that reflect and gain value from the diversity between the five exemplar
models, and the diversity in stakeholders’ perceptions. Scaling-up involves collaboration
between a number of stakeholders and cannot be the work of a single agency or
population, and using qualitative methods allowed this diversity to be captured. A short
online survey was used to collect further standardised information from local
implementation sites.
These methods were triangulated in analysis, bringing together findings from different
methods to provide a more rounded analysis, and where possible drawing comparisons
between methods. Alternative approaches, such as conducting the evaluation only
through documentary analysis or only through structured quantitative questionnaires,
would not have enabled the exploration of the diversity of perspectives that are intrinsic to
effective scale-up. The range of methods used and the use of triangulation also adds
credibility to the research and provides a check on accuracy. The evaluation team
consisted of a total of eight members. Interviews and analysis were undertaken by six
team members. The initial findings from the evaluation were presented to UNICEF Country
Office and Regional Office staff in four presentations, and these aspects of the methods
additionally provide credibility and validation and support accuracy.
1.3.2. Inception period
The evaluation began with an inception period which involved:
• Desk review of model documents and other relevant documents (see Annex 7 for
a full list of documents reviewed in the inception and evaluation phases)
• A 4-day inception mission in February 2020 to meet with the UNICEF Country
Office teams and key stakeholders
• Development of a theory of change for modelling (shown in Annex 2)
• Development of the UNICEF Scale-up Framework. This is a summary of the
evidence (from selected syntheses or frameworks) about the necessary steps,
strategies and determinants for effective scale-up. It outlines what UNICEF needs
to have achieved by the end of the modelling process and is the main assessment
framework used in this evaluation. The version of the UNICEF Scale-up
Framework used in the evaluation is shown here. A slightly modified version,
revised in light of learning from its application in the evaluation, together with
explanation of how it was developed, is provided in Annex 8. The UNICEF Scale-up
Framework is highly compatible with the OECD/DAC evaluation criteria as applied
to individual models or interventions – see further Annex 8.

1.3.3. Evaluation: elements of work
Use of the theory of change
The theory of change informed the aspects of modelling that were explored in the
evaluation, particularly in the review of documentation and interviews with stakeholders.
The evaluation reviewed whether the inputs and activities described in the theory of
change were available or carried out and in what forms. It also reviewed whether the
intended outputs were created or achieved, and whether the intended outcomes and
impacts were secured. The evaluation team refined the theory of change in light of
findings of the evaluation.
Review of model documentation
The evaluation team reviewed documentation for each model provided during the
inception period. To ensure inclusion of all relevant documents in the evaluation, the three
relevant UNICEF teams (Child Welfare, Early Child Development and Education) then
completed a checklist for the exemplar model/s (Annex 9) to show which documents and
elements of work had been completed. This identified further relevant documents that
were then reviewed by the evaluation team. The evaluation team summarised key points
from this document review relating to each model and its evaluation, and reviewed
documents further to explore issues emerging from stakeholder interviews.
Review of further governance, planning and strategy documents
The evaluation team also reviewed a number of governance, planning and strategy
documents provided by UNICEF during the course of the evaluation. A full list is show in
Annex 7. Key points from these documents were summarised, and the team reviewed
planning documents further to identify whether and how issues emerging from
stakeholder interviews and from further analysis were referred to in governance
documents.
18 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
Interviews with UNICEF teams and senior leaders
Interviews were held with the head and members of each of the three relevant UNICEF
programme teams in June 2020 (the teams responsible for the development and
modelling of the five exemplar models), and the Representative and Deputy
Representative of the UNICEF Serbia CO in September 2020.
Interviews with systems stakeholders and local implementation
stakeholders
Between August and October 2020, 40 interviews were conducted with key system-level
and local stakeholders engaged in the modelling phase. Participants were identified by the
UNICEF teams. They included representatives from Ministries, national sector bodies,
partner NGOs, research groups and local implementation partners. The roles of
stakeholders in modelling varied, and included: partnering with UNICEF in the selection
and development of models; responsibility for implementing models within local services;
undertaking evaluation or associated research; funding implementation or evaluation;
providing strategic support to modelling; and involvement in strategic discussions and
decisions.
Some interviews covered more than one model, and some involved more than one
participant. A total of 54 participants took part in an interview. The number of participants
per model is shown in Table . A list of all the organisations involved is shown in Annex 10.
Overall, of the sample of 54 participants, 44 were women and 10 were men.

Survey of local implementation sites
Following the interviews, a short online questionnaire was developed to explore
implementation experiences and views about the models with individuals involved in local
implementation. Coverage was informed by the UNICEF Scale-up Framework and by a key
implementation framework, the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research
(see above section 1.4.1). The sample was provided by the UNICEF teams. Because the
focus was on practical implementation experience, the survey only covered models
currently being delivered. The survey did not include the Family Outreach Worker model,
and only minimal coverage of the Intermittent Foster Care model as sites currently
delivering these models were previously involved in interviews. A total of 39 complete
responses to the survey were received (Table ).
The survey included questions about:
• Perceptions of the model
• Quality of programme resources and support
• Collaboration with other organisations in delivery
• Fit with organisational priorities and work

• Barriers to continued delivery

Analysis of financial systems
The analysis of financial systems involved desk-based review of documents concerning the
funding sources available in the public system at national and local levels, international
financing institutions, major NGOs and donors, public-private partnerships and private
financial systems. This was complemented with conversations with key contacts of the
evaluation team member who led this element, to obtain further information. Additionally,
the costing analyses already undertaken by UNICEF were reviewed. List of documents
reviewed and organisations from which participants were interviewed can be found in
Annexes 7 and 10 respectively.
Triangulation, validation and development of findings and recommendations
Most of the analysis drew on more than one data source. The way in which data sources
were brought together varied. For some evaluation questions, the lead data source was
the documentary analysis. Here the team reviewed and summarised the content of key
documents, noting what was absent as well as what was reported. Other research
questions drew more on the qualitative data. Here the team reviewed consistency and
difference in the data from different study populations (for example, assessing whether
assessments of stakeholders were consistent across stakeholders from different settings,
and consistent with data from UNICEF personnel). Where relevant, the coverage or
absence of key points in model or governance documents was also noted. In this way
different data sources were brought together to substantiate, contrast or add to each
other.
The interim findings were presented to the three UNICEF programme teams and to
representatives from the Regional Office and UNICEF Headquarters, in four presentations.
This provided validation of the evaluation team’s interpretation, an opportunity to identify
any inaccuracies, and further refinement of interpretation and recommendations.
1.3.4. Gender equality considerations
Gender equality was taken into account in the methodology in a number of ways:
• The methodology and conduct were informed by the UN-SWAP standards and
gender equality and the empowerment of women considerations10
10 United National Evaluation Group (2018) UN-SWAP Evaluation Performance Indicator Technical Note
21 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
• The evaluation team reviewed model evaluation reports to identify findings about
the research and impact of models disaggregated by gender, and implications for
model development and scale-up
• Gender and wider equity issues were explored in discussions with UNICEF teams
and leaders
• They were also explored in interviews with stakeholders
• The team ensured that research instruments were gender-neutral, and
stakeholder participation was monitored to ensure that women were not under-
represented
• Strategy documents, plans and other documents pertinent to modelling were
reviewed to identify gender issues or considerations highlighted
• Gender and wider equity issues were considered in data analysis and
interpretation, and gender implications of plans for scale-up are highlighted in the
analysis in Chapter 7
Further ethical issue considerations are set out in Annex 12.
1.3.5. Stakeholder involvement and reference group
Key stakeholders in the modelling process, both within UNICEF and externally, were all
informants in the evaluation and took part in interviews or the survey. The UNICEF teams
led the modelling process for the exemplar programmes. They were involved in the
inception phase, took part in group interviews lasting around 90 minutes, provided further
information and documents during the course of the evaluation, took part in sessions to
discuss the findings, and provided commentary on an early draft of the report.
The roles of external stakeholders in modelling varied, and included: partnering with
UNICEF in the selection and development of models; responsibility for implementing
models within local services; undertaking evaluation or associated research; funding
implementation or evaluation; providing strategic support to modelling; and involvement
in strategic discussions and decisions. These stakeholders either took part in an hour long
interview or completed the online survey (estimated 15 minutes); a few were also involved
in a meeting during the inception phase.
Given the extensive involvement of stakeholders in the evaluation itself, a small external
reference group was established but it was not government-led given the centrality of
government perspectives on modelling in the evaluation itself. The reference group
advised on the early design stages and reviewed the final report.
1.3.6. Strengths and limitations of evaluation and methods
The strengths of the evaluation methods are:
• The use of evidence-based frameworks and concepts from implementation
science to understand and explore the processes and determinants of scale-up.
This meant that issues were uncovered that had not been addressed in-depth in
previous evaluations.
• The focus on five exemplar models provided tangibility and depth to discussions
of modelling and scale-up, making them more concrete and less abstract.
22 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
• The range of methods used, including qualitative interviews, paired interviews
and focus groups; online survey; extensive documentary analysis, provided
diversity and support credibility, validation and accuracy.
The evaluation design had some limitations:
• The focus of the evaluation was on models, rather than on themes or wider
programmes of work. A key finding was that modelling needs to be explicitly
oriented to the wider ambitions behind models. These are represented in
UNICEF’s work by themes or programmes. The focus on models means that the
evaluation team was not fully sighted on this wider work.
• The evaluation did not service users or beneficiary children and families, as this
was not feasible within the project resources, although their perspectives were to
some extent captured in existing model evaluation reports.
• The evaluation mainly used a qualitative methodology, which captured in-depth
contextualised data, but meant that data was not standardised and quantifiable.
The number of interviews conducted per model was limited. Interviews were
either conducted in English (not the first language of interviewees), or in Serbian
(transcribed in Serbian with summaries translated in English), which affected the
richness of data available.
• Samples were provided by UNICEF so that those more relevant and involved in
modelling could be interviewed, although this is likely to orient the sample to
individuals with more favourable perceptions of modelling and of the model.
• There were gaps in the data available. For example, gender and equity issues
were not addressed in depth in any of the model evaluation reports that were
reviewed. There was very limited data on the gender-related reach of the models
(none for most) and no data on the gender-related impacts of the models
• The UNICEF Scale-up Framework which shaped the evaluation had not previously
been tested or validated, although adaptions were made in its use to include
other items reflecting key aspects of scale-up work or requirements, and to
modify concepts and language in the light of learning from fieldwork.
1.4. Report structure
Chapter 2 provides a brief analysis of the national context of Serbia, covering social,
political and financial considerations. It draws on documentary review supported by some
further intelligence from key informants.
Chapters 3 to 6 are the main chapters reporting evaluation findings. They follow the
structure of the UNICEF Scale-up Framework since this represents the analytical
framework used in the evaluation. They address, in turn, the domains set out in the
UNICEF Scale-up Framework. Chapter 3 reviews whether modelling resulted in
programmes that were optimised and ready for scale-up. Chapter 4 addresses whether
modelling built the evidence base needed for scale-up. Chapter 5 considers whether
modelling results in models that were acceptable to and fit for the national context.
Chapter 6 summarises evidence about whether modelling resulted in the necessary
commitments for scale-up being secured.
The implications of findings from these four chapters are then discussed in chapter 7. It
provides a summary analysis of each model and its feasibility for scale-up and outlines the
work needed for each model to take forward scale-up. The chapter then draws together
findings and implications for how modelling could be strengthened. Chapter 8 sets out
conclusions, lessons learnt, and eight recommendations.

S
• The highest rates of poverty are among children and youth, in South-Eastern Serbia,
and in households headed by someone with limited education, unemployed or
inactive. Children from poor families and Roma children encounter substantial
obstacles to accessing education.
• The number of children in alternative care continues to rise, albeit at a decelerating
rate, and with uneven progress in de-institutionalisation. Juvenile crime is declining,
although the share accounted for by girls is rising.
• Despite efforts to de-centralise responsibility for social protection, education and
health, central government has by far the largest role in financing these areas.
• Local governments’ role in the area of health and education is limited to capital
expenditures. Municipalities have more room to intervene in funding social care,
although this has not resulted in significant funding levels. In half of municipalities,
less than 0.37% of the budget is dedicated to social care services, and 29 local
governments allocated no funding to social care.
• Almost two thirds of all public expenditure is directed toward social spending (social
protection, education and health) but half of that is directed to pensions. Public
spending on social services is very limited.
• Besides European Union, which is the single most important donor, Serbia benefits
from assistance from various other multilateral and bilateral donors. Private public
partnerships are at an early stage, focused on physical infrastructure.
24 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
• The new Law on the Planning System introduces the principle of coordination and
cooperation, with a focus on economic strengthening and education and on aspects of
social protection including the social care, seasonal employment reforms and housing
and pre-school. The fiscal strategy for 2021 does not suggest planned increases in
social protection expenditure and continued restraint is likely.
• There is a clear annual calendar of milestones for budgetary planning. However, levels
of transparency and public participation are low, which highlights the complexities of
intervening to address financial allocation.
2.1 Serbia social context
2.1.1. Social and political framework
Serbia is a democratic, upper-middle income country with a total population of just under
7 million in 2019 (mid-year), with negative population growth rate of -5.3, and infant
mortality rate of 4.8 per 1000 live births. Population ageing is one of the demographic
challenges, with increased older population dependency ratio (from 24.7 in 2002 to 31.8 in
2019) and relatively high average age of the total population - 43.3 years in 2019. Over half
of the population lives in urban areas.
Serbia is a unitary decentralised state with central government and two autonomous
provinces, and a system of local self-government consisting of 174 local self-government
units. Serbia was granted status as a candidate country for EU accession in March 2012,
and over the past decade has been making steady progress towards social, economic and
political development and reform, and greater regional cooperation. In areas relevant to
child rights, Serbia has made efforts to reform legislation and public policy including
legislative changes with regard to education, social policy, health, justice and anti-
discrimination provisions.11 National legislation is largely compliant with international
standards, incorporating principles of a child-oriented approach, respect for human rights
and social inclusion.12
During the last two decades Serbia has significantly improved the legal and policy
framework for combating discrimination, social exclusion, and gender inequality. The
country ratified several United Nations human rights conventions, including the
Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW),
Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and Convention on the Rights of Persons with
Disabilities (CRPD). It has been regularly reporting to these international human rights
mechanisms. However, there are many challenges that remain and require further decisive
action.
Poverty
Poverty is twice as common in non-urban areas (10.5 percent versus 4.9 in urban areas),
and higher in South-Eastern Serbia, among children up to 14 years of age, youth (15-24
years), households headed by someone with a low education level, unemployed or
inactive. Poverty is also slightly higher among women than men (7.2% vs. 6.9%). Some
120,000 children (aged 0-18) and 40,000 youth (aged 19-24) lived in absolute poverty in
2017.13

Education
Children from poor families and Roma children still encounter substantial obstacles
concerning access to education, attendance, the quality of education they are offered and
in their progression. As a result, many students fail to meet initial expectations and are
then frequently directed into programmes and education plans intended for students with
learning disabilities, or drop out from school. Children from vulnerable groups who are
most in need of additional support for early development and learning are the least
involved in pre-school education, which suggests that they face high inequity. According to
Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) data from 2019, only 10.5% percent of poorest
children (age 36-59 months) attend pre-school, and only 7.4% of Roma children, and
45.9% children from rural areas attend pre-school.14
The 2019 MICS showed that only 85.4% of Roma children have timely primary school
entry. The enrolment rates have been improving as this is an increase compared to the
2014 MICS when timely entry was registered among 69% of Roma children. However,
gender differences are prominent with a slightly lower proportion of girls entering primary
school on time than boys (82.33% vs. 86.3%). Only 63.7% of Roma children complete
primary school compared with 99.5% for all children. The proportion of adolescents
attending secondary school is 94.1% for the general population, with gender differences
slightly in favour of boys (94.7% vs. 93.3% for girls). The completion of secondary school
rate is 98.4% for boys and 97.0% for girls. The net attendance of secondary school is much
lower among Roma children - 28.4%, with gender differences (30.0% among boys and
26.6% among girls).15 Child marriage is a key reason for this. According to 2019 MICS,
15.9% of Roma women old between 15 and 49 years were married before age of 15 years,
and 55.8% before age of 18 years.16 In Serbia child marriage among predominantly Roma
population is mostly driven by poverty, level of education (Roma girls are at particular risk
of school dropout around the ages of 12-14), and gender norms.
Administrative data show that one third of pupils aged 15 are functionally illiterate. This
points to an education of inadequate quality that requires further modernisation of the
curriculum and teaching methods and intersectoral coordination to support inclusion and
prevent dropout.
Since the introduction of inclusive education in 2009, the number of students in special
schools decreased by 25.3%. The structure of students in special schools has also changed
since 2009, shifting towards children with multiple disabilities.
Out of home care
Since 2013 the overall number of children in alternative care has continued to increase,
although at slower pace than in the previous period. In 2018, 89.5% of children without
parental care were placed into foster families and 9.6% into residential institutions.
Despite challenging circumstances, clear progress has been made towards de-
institutionalization. However, this process has not been felt equally by all children. There
remains a slightly higher number of boys predominantly among children with disabilities in
both residential and foster care. Despite the introduction of a ban on placing children
under-three years of age (2011) in institutional care, it continues to occur. In 2019, among
children without parental care placed in residential institutions, 4% were younger than 3
years.17
Juvenile crime
According to official statistics, there were 2,903 juvenile criminal reports, and 1,676
convictions in Serbia in 2019. Most reports and convictions are for boys (90.6% of

convicted cases).18 The trends in the number of reports and convictions since 2013 are not
linear but are in decline overall (13.5% decrease in reports since 2015). For juvenile
criminal convictions there is a small but continuing increase in the share of girls (from 7.4%
of all convicted in 2015 to 9.4% in 2019).
2.2 Political and financial context
2.1.2. Public finance systems: central and local government
responsibilities
Overall public expenditure in Serbia amounted to 43.4% of gross domestic product (GDP)
in 2018, relatively high compared to the level of development and explained by the legacy
of socialism. Social spending amounted to approaching 24.2% of GDP, of which the largest
share was for pensions (10.4% GDP). Spending on health was 5.5% of GDP and on
education 3.3%.

Health care
Health care in the Republic of Serbia is based on the principles of universality and
solidarity, and the right of citizens to physical and mental health is a matter covered by the
constitution. The health care system covers the entire territory of the country with
primary, secondary and tertiary health care. It is an extremely complex system whose
regulation includes a number of complementary laws and bylaws. This is a clear challenge
for monitoring the system and its financing and understanding the functional relationships
between its elements.
Health care is financed from three sources: compulsory health insurance funds, public
funds, and private funding by citizens.
Health insurance is compulsory for all citizens who have income, including wages,
pensions, benefits, etc., although those without an income can also make contributions.
Family members of the insured have the rights from the obligatory health insurance if not
on another basis. The Minister in charge of health care decides on the scope and content
of health services that are funded from compulsory health insurance. The National Health
Insurance Fund contracts with health care providers, generally those that are part of a
network established by the Government. At the end of 2017, the Fund had more than 6.9
million insured persons, almost the entire population of Serbia.
The budget of the Republic of Serbia funds health care for groups of the population that
are exposed to an increased risk of illness, prevention, suppression, and treatment of
diseases of greater public importance, as well the socially vulnerable, children, those over
65 years of age, the unemployed and Roma who, due to their traditional way of life, do not
have a permanent or temporary residence in the Republic of Serbia.
The role of autonomous province and local self-government units is limited to providing
emergency medical care, health care planning and development activities, preventive
measures in the immediate living environment, etc. In previous regulations, the role of
local authorities in health care was more significant, but local capacities proved to be
insufficient to ensure an adequate level of universality, and a centralised model was
adopted.
Further financing comes from founders of public health institutions who provide business
premises, equipment, construction, and investment maintenance. Citizens can also fund
health care through direct payment for services, i.e. voluntary health insurance.
Total health care expenditure increased during the first decade of the 2000s as a
consequence of the recovery of the previously devastated health care system, the growth
of the population's purchasing power and the change in the structure of health care
spending. In the second decade of the 2000s, a downward trend followed, which can be
explained primarily by the growth of GDP, but also by the reduction of other indicators
such as the number of health care staff. Between 2014 and 2018, the number of doctors
was reduced by 630, and the number of other medical staff was reduced by more than
3,500. Expenditure on health care fell by over 3 billion dinars annually. The number of
visits to the doctor in 2018 was 4 million fewer than in 2014, and the number of hospital
days 390,000 lower. The only increase was in infrastructure investments: the number of
hospital beds increased by 1300.
Over the past two decades, the share of public expenditure accounted for by health care
expenditure decreased from 70.9% in 2003 to 57.6% in 2017. Private consumption rose
from 29.1% of total health care expenditures in 2003 to 42.4% in 2017. This suggests that
increasing expectations to which the state is not ready to respond. The COVID-19
pandemic will increase the total spending on health care from 2020.
28 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
Education
The Constitution stipulates that primary and secondary education is free, and higher
education is also free for gifted students of lower financial status. Enrolment of children in
a preschool institution is mandatory in the year preceding the start of primary school, i.e.
children aged 5 to 6.5 years. The education strategy in the Republic of Serbia envisages
compulsory secondary education, but this has not yet been introduced into the legal
framework.
Finance for education comes from the budget of the Republic of Serbia, the autonomous
province and local self-government units.
From 5 to 6.5 years, pre-school education is free and mandatory for all children for 9
months and 4 hours per day. Pre-school education is free for children with disabilities who
should, by law, be prioritized for enrolment. Funds are allocated from the central budget
for this. The local self-government provides up to 80% of funds for the pre-school
education of children aged 0.5 until the beginning of mandatory pre-school, determined
on the basis of criteria adopted by the Minister. The remaining amount is usually paid by
the parents. The local self-government also finances additional support, transportation of
children and investments for public institutions.
The costs of primary education are borne by the central government or the autonomous
province. This includes salaries and compensations of employees, development programs
of the institution, professional training and investment projects. The law stipulates funding
from the central budget to support especially talented primary school students in the form
of non-refundable financial aid prescribed by the Minister, but this practice has not taken
root. The local self-government bears the costs of investment and current maintenance of
the school as well as other current expenses. Also, from these sources, funds are allocated
for a part of professional training and a smaller part of expenses for employees. Local
governments provide transportation of students for a distance of more than four
kilometres, i.e. transportation, accommodation and nutrition of children and students with
disabilities, regardless of distance.
Secondary education is financed from the central budget and the budget of the
autonomous province in the same way as primary education. Funding for especially
talented high school students in the form of non-refundable financial aid is functional, in
contrast to the same measure intended for primary school pupils. The local self-
government has no obligation to provide transportation for students, although this can be
funded in accordance with local policies.
According to the Third National Report on Social Inclusion and Poverty Reduction, applying
the methodology of the European Union, estimated public expenditures on education at
the level of the Republic of Serbia in 2015 amounted to 3.9% of GDP, which is below the
average public spending at the EU-28 level of 5.09% of GDP. According to the Ministry of
Finance, total public expenditure on education in 2017 amounted to 3.98% of GDP. In
terms of education level, 16.4% of total expenditures are allocated to pre-school
education, 43.2% to primary education, 18.8% to secondary education and 14.5% to higher
education. The fiscal strategy for 2021-2022 plans to increase education expenditures at
the expense of social protection expenditures, which will be reduced due to better
targeting of cash transfers.
Social Care
Support to citizens in the field of social protection is divided into social benefits and social
services. Funds for the main social benefits are allocated from the central budget. This
includes Financial social assistance, Child allowance and Allowance for other care and
29 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
assistance. Cash benefits tare regulated by a separate Law on Financial Support to Families
with Children, namely: Birth grant and Wage compensation during absence due to
childbirth - maternity leave, parental leave and leave for special child care. The budget of
the Republic of Serbia also provides funds for one-time assistance in crisis situations that
have caused a threat to a large number of citizens.
The aim of reforms over the last two decades in the area of social services was to allow the
plurality of service providers and contribute to de-institutionalisation by reducing the
reliance on large residential institutions, and instead develop community based services,
whilst reducing the role of the Centres for Social Work (CSW).
The central budget provides funds for foster care as well as for counselling and training for
foster families and adoptive parents, and residential care and supported housing for
people with disabilities in less developed local communities. The budget of the Republic of
Serbia provides funds for case management in CSW, funds for the work of institutions
founded by the state or autonomous province, as well as funds intended for the
implementation of programs for the improvements of social protection. In addition,
central government finances the activities of the CSW related to the protection of the
children’s rights, adoption and guardianship, in accordance with the Family Law.
The provincial government funds programmes for the improvement of social protection in
the autonomous province, financing of institutions established by the provincial authorities
(except residential care institutions) and for innovative services and social protection
services of special importance for the autonomous province.
The responsibility of the local government in terms of cash benefits refers to one-time
assistance in individual cases as well as various other types of assistance regulated by local
policies. In terms of social services, funds are allocated from local budgets for day care
community-based services; services for independent living; emergency and temporary
accommodation services and counselling/therapy and social/educational services. In
addition, local authorities are funded through earmarked transfers to provide programmes
aimed to enhance social protection in the local government area, and innovative services
and those of particular importance to the Republic of Serbia. However, for municipalities
with below average level of development, all six types of services are covered with
earmarked transfers.
Central government determines the amount of earmarked transfers and criteria for
allocation to local authorities (largely on the basis of population size) and which services
constitute ‘services of particular importance for the Republic of Serbia’. Municipalities are
assigned to four categories, based on level of development. The least developed (in the
4th category) receive transfers regardless of whether they are able to co-finance social
protection services from their budgets. Those in categories 2 and 3 are funded on the basis
that they will supplement central funding with their own funding. Municipalities in
category 1 are the most developed and do not receive any transfers. The net result is that
major cities could end up receiving higher amounts of funds than they actually spent on
local services.
30 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
A supplement to local funding is that every year, Ministry of Labour, Veteran and Social
Affairs issues a call for applications19 from civil society organisations for family protection
projects at the local level. The latest call dedicated 40,000€ for these purposes.
The autonomous province of Vojvodina has more responsibility for social services,
operated through the Vojvodina Capital Fund which provided funding for health and social
protection among other areas. In 2019 projects in the areas of health and social protection
were granted a total of around 2.1m€, and education projects around €2.9m. However, a
review of the project calls20 during the last five years shows that only one almost 100 calls
was intended exclusively for projects in the area of social protection, and even focused on
reconstruction and adaptation of residential facilities.
Overall spending on services within the mandate of local self-governments in 2018 stood
at €31.1 million or 0.07 % of the GDP. Of this, day care community-based services
accounted for 81% of total local government spending on social services. In half
municipalities in Serbia, spending on social services within local government mandate was
below €76,600 per year21, and in half less than 0.35% of their budgets is dedicated to these
purposes. Only five local self-governments reserved more than 2.5% of their budgets for
social services, some of these among the least developed areas of the country. Twenty-six
local self-governments did not allocate any funds from their budgets for social services.
Most local governments provide only two to three services with higher number of services
only in larger cities. The number of beneficiaries and funds invested has not changed in
recent years in the majority of municipalities in Serbia. In 8 out of 145 local self-
governments, there were no social services offered. Counselling/therapy were present in
about a quarter of all municipalities and cities in 2018.
During the last decade, overall spending for social services within the mandate of local self-
governments has not changed significantly in relation to GDP, although absolute amounts
have grown steadily. In 2018, expenditure for local social protection services amounted to
3.65 billion dinars, increased from 2.6 billion dinars in 2015 and 2.5 billion dinars in 2012.
Allocations from local government budgets for social protection services vary according to
the availability of alternative sources. Municipalities and cities, from their budgets, had
allocated from 70 to 86% of the total funds spent. With the growth of alternative sources
of financing local services, the share of funds from the local government budget is
declining while the share of funds from the local self-government budget is increases.

2.1.3. Constraint and austerity
The large number of cases per social worker has been troubling the profession for years
and has impacted on the quality of provided services. Austerity measures adopted in 2015
with the intention to curb the growing public deficit and public debt involved reduction of
wages and employment in the public sector. The downsizing of the public-sector workforce
was envisaged as a 5% cut each year for the three years subsequent to the introduction of
the fiscal consolidation package. However, implementation has not evolved according to
the plan. Instead, as anecdotal evidence and press coverage suggest, mainly individuals
near retirement age have been urged to leave the public sector. This was especially the
case for women near retirement age (60 years), although, by law, they had the right to
retire at 65, similar to men.22 Further, all new hires in the public sector have been
forbidden. So, despite the fact that budgets for social services have not been under the
attack of austerity measures, bearing in mind that women are the majority of the
workforce in the social service sector, it seems likely that employment constraints coupled
with wage cuts have had significant impact on the quality and quantity of service
provisions in the recent period.
According to the Strategy (see below), one of the biggest challenges for the development
of the social services at the local level is the alignment of adopted policies with the
financing structure. In other words, the financing structure is not aligned with national
priorities nor with expert opinion, and for example the structure of public funding for
social services does not reflect the intention to de-institutionalise care for children.
Allocation of funds for community-based services has somewhat increased while there was
no reduction in the financing of institutional care during the last decade. Despite the aims
of the previous strategy and opinions of experts in the field that beneficiaries should be
placed in families and communities, finances have not followed these recommendations.
Services for family accommodation and residential care institutions have secure financing
from the central budget, whereas development and financing of family support services is
in the mandate of local governments and depends on their capacities.
22 https://portal.pep-net.org/public/project/20000
32 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
There has been a disequilibrium between the expectations, as presented in all strategic
documents guiding the system of social services since 2000s, and the funding available.
More than 75% of social services spending is covered through local budgets. In other
words, it is up to local governments and their capacities to provide a framework for the
normal functioning of the system of social services at the municipal level. The latest
mapping of social services at the local level, performed in 201823, confirms that these
services are not sufficient, not equally available throughout the country and with varying
quality among different municipalities. Provision of certain services is unstable and
unsustainable. Every second local self-government has decreased spending from its budget
on social services or has kept the zero-based budget compared to the 2015 mapping of the
social services.
2.1.4. Other finance systems
Multilateral cooperation
Serbia receives assistance from numerous partners including UN agencies and multilateral
and bilateral donors.24 It is difficult to compare the support received, since assistance is
provided in different forms, with different objectives and with different reporting
methods. Serbian Government and World Bank estimates that the country receives
between USD 0.5 and 1 billion each year from its development partners.
Among multilateral partners, the European Union through the Instrument for Pre-
Accessions (IPA) has been the largest donor in Serbia since 2000, and Serbia is the biggest
recipient of EU funds among the Western Balkans countries with €200 million annually.
Since 2000, the EU have implemented projects regarding justice and public administration
reform as well as physical infrastructure.
Under the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) II, in the period of 2014-2020
Serbia received financial assistance of €1,539.1 billion total, including €123.7 million
allocated in the area of education, employment and social policies. That is around €220
million per year or 0.6% of the Serbian GDP. Compared to government spending on similar
areas, this is quite small (Table ) The main goals of the IPA II support were: harmonisation
of legislation with EU law; improved quality of educational provisions; enhanced social
inclusion; and active labour market policies. The main goals of the support in this area
were: harmonisation of legislation with EU law; improved quality of educational provisions;
enhanced social inclusion; and active labour market policies.

Most of the funds placed from the IPA to local social services are allocated from the
education, employment and social policies sector. However, part of local social services is
financed from other sectors such as democracy and governance as well as rule of law and
fundamental rights. There is no separate allocation data available for local social services
from the IPA fund. The overall share of funds from donations and on the basis of
international cooperation in the costs of local social services is not high. According to data
from the mapping of local social services, this source participated in the total costs with
16% in 2012, 5% in 2015 and only 2.8% in 2018.
There is currently no available report of the projects realised with IPA II funds. The
European Commission proposal suggested an overall budget of €14.5 for Western Balkans
and Turkey for the period 2021-2027. Recently, the Ministry of European Integration
stated that by the end of June 2020 the preliminary list of priorities for financing in 2021
and 2022 would be suggested to European Commission, but no public announcement has
been made on this.
Despite the fact that funds from donations (in particular Instrument for Pre-Accessions
(IPA) programmes) have been recognised as important means of support for social
protection projects, most local governments (especially those from the most
underdeveloped areas) lack capacity to prepare and implement projects to receive this
type of support25.
Bilateral cooperation
Serbia receives bilateral assistance from 17 partner countries.26 According to Serbia Report
on SDG Policy Support, seven key bilateral partners have invested a total of $ 427,7 million
in achieving the SDGs in Serbia from 2018 to 2020. As stated in the report, it is noteworthy
that SDG 1 and particularly SDG 10, both very important in tackling inequalities, poverty
and social exclusion, receive a very minor part of resources from development partners.

Switzerland is among the most important of bilateral donors, providing financial support
totalling 400 million € through its Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC).
Priorities include the enhancement of the quality of life of Serbian citizens, particularly
those who belong to excluded groups, through improving the rule of law at the local level,
strengthening social cohesion and increasing the responsibility, transparency, efficiency
and effectiveness of the local self-governments, as well as the participation of the
population in the decision-making processes27.
The Swiss PRO Programme in 2019 launched a public call to civil service organisations,
aimed at increasing the availability and quality of social protection services. The call
supports the deliverer of new social services (not currently available in the municipalities).
The Government of Switzerland supports about 20 local governments with a total of
€242,000 in establishing an efficient and sustainable social protection system at the local
level. Support is for a period of 1 year with a maximum grant of €12,000 per project. Each
project should cover at least 500 users of social services from vulnerable groups.
Private sector donors: Corporations and Foundations
The highest giving donors (2016-2020) were NIS a.d. Novi Sad, Novak Djokovic Foundation,
Delta Foundation, and Dunav Osiguranje a.d. Beograd. The significance of the impact of
donations is highlighted by the fact that in 2015, expenditures on counselling services
increased threefold compared to 2012, largely due to donors support28 for the new FOW
service in four cities in Serbia (Novi Sad, Belgrade, Kragujevac and Nis). In 2015 counselling
services had the highest share of donations in their financing structure, around 45% due to
UNICEF programme. For other service types donations were around 2-3% of the total
expenditures.
Private public partnerships
Public-private partnership (PPP) is a long-term cooperation between public and private
partner to provide financing, construction, reconstruction, management or maintenance
of infrastructure and other facilities of public importance as well as provision of services of
public importance.29 In principle this could include infrastructure for educational and
health institutions. In fact, there are examples of PPP in the educational system such as
dual education 30 or that have the elements of PPP even though are not being officially
regulated as such.31 However, the majority of approved project proposals so far concern
the reconstruction and maintenance of physical infrastructure.
Some commentators on Serbian legislation on PPP point out that there are limitations of
the current framework when it comes to specific areas (education and health system).32 In
detailed observation of the content of the Law on public-private partnership, no direct
obstacles to its application in education, health or social protection can be found.

35 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
Nevertheless, the models offered by this law are primarily intended for large investments,
and the procedure itself is too complex and expensive to be applied in the basic forms of
health care, education or social protection. Therefore, PPP, as a legal procedure, is
currently not suitable for application in these fields until the law is changed and a model
that is conducive to smaller investments is introduced.
On the other hand, PPP, as a concept, could be implemented by relying on other
regulations. The Law on Public Services33 offers the possibility of establishing public
services in a mixed founding structure. This means that it is possible to establish a public
service whose founders are both a local government and a private entity. It should be
borne in mind that public services cannot make a profit, so this type of organisation would
be more appropriate for cooperation between the public sector and civil society
organisations. It is also a possible way of expressing social responsibility by private
companies that would at the same time participate in the steering bodies of the public
service that they have jointly established with the public authorities.
Overall, this option has not been sufficiently explored, and the risks and advantages of this
type of financing need to be considered carefully. Regulation will be an important
consideration, and the level of public service to be provided must be in accordance with
the prescribed quality standards. The readiness of the authorities to relinquish
participation, in health care, education and social protection, to the private sector should
be determined. This commitment of the government is not recognised in any source of
public policy.
When it comes to initiating PPP in other areas, such as education or social protection on a
local level, it should be carefully considered what are all the advantages and risks of this type
of financing. The important part of the provision of services is regulation - The level of public
service that will be provided in this way must be in accordance with the prescribed quality
standards. It should also be considered that literature on Serbian legislation on PPP points
out that there are limitations of the current framework when it comes to specific areas
(education and health system).34
2.1.5. Public policy framework for social protection
Two key strategic documents that will guide the development of social protection in the
following years are the Economic Reform Programme (ERP) and the Strategy of Social
Protection Development for 2019-2025. These will binding on government at all levels, but
the Strategy has not yet been adopted. It should be noted that both documents were
prepared before the corona virus crisis and will likely be reviewed once the scale of the
crisis and its consequences are fully assessed.
Economic Reform Programme
The New Economic Reform Programme (ERP) for the period 2020-202235 sets out a limited
number of structural reforms in the areas of social protection and education. In the area of
education, mid-term priorities of the government are investments in dual (i.e. vocational
and school-based) education system and digitalisation of educational system, including the
development of the unique pupil number information system in education. In the area of

36 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
social protection, there is only one structural reform – introduction of the integrated
system of social cards.
Law on the Planning System
The Law on the Planning System36 introduces the principle of coordination and
cooperation, which, among other things, implies special respect for the Government's
priority goals in formulating public policies. In this regard, it is important to keep in mind
the content of the Work Program of the Government of the Republic of Serbia.37 In this,
the further economic strengthening of Serbia is set as one of the six priority goals. In
achieving this goal, the Government, among other things, emphasizes the importance of
strengthening human capacity. The key role is assigned to education, while social
protection is not perceived as an important element of strengthening human capacity.
One of the other goals of the government is an efficient and responsible state that
includes, among other things, social and population policy. Within social policy, two
priorities have been formulated. The first is the introduction of the social card as an
instrument for more precise targeting of social assistance. The second is to expand the
scope of seasonal employment reforms in order to reduce unemployment and
dependence on state aid. The priorities of population policy are somewhat more
substantial. The plan is to improve housing for young married, amendments to the Law on
financial support for families with children in line with the experiences of the past few
years, and the strengthening of infrastructure of preschool institutions through
partnerships with employers.
Key elements of the new law on planning system are to connect policy planning with
planning of the government’s budget. This should allow prioritisation and more rational
use of public resources. The Law requires impact analysis to be conducted during the
process of planning, formulating and adopting public policies and regulations (ex-ante) as
well as after the implementation of public policies (ex post) with the aim to determine its
results.38 This means that any decision on the introduction of new public policy has to be
preceded with the analysis of its potential effects. This may provide an opportunity for
UNICEF to gain traction where they have good impact data regarding models.
Draft Social Welfare Strategy
The draft Strategy of Social Protection Development for 2019-2025 period recognises that
services in the mandate of local governments are undeveloped and with unequal access
throughout the country. Despite this gloomy picture of the current state of affairs in the
service provision at the local level, the Strategy offers no clear direction for change as
there are no recommendations except general claims like:” It is expected that additional
funds secured thorough earmarked transfers would enable development of social services
in local self-governments”.39 Similarly in relation to counselling/therapy, the strategy does
not offer a precise direction for change, claiming that: “For the support of families with
children at risk of early school leaving, and prevention of child separation, it is necessary to
extend counselling-therapy and socio-educational services to other municipalities”.
The new strategy is more concrete in the area of the dropout prevention and intervention.
It acknowledges that the current model lacks efficiency as Centre for Social Work do not

37 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
have enough capacity to deal with this problem on a regular basis. The strategy, thus,
recommends that local self-governments with a higher share of students at high risk of
dropout and children living in Roma settlements allocate larger number of workers from
Centres for Social Work for these tasks. The Strategy also advises that central budget
funds should be secured for these purposes.
Given the quite uneven funding of social services from local budgets across municipalities,
the Strategy considers determining a minimum level of expenditures for social protection
at the local level. Although no evaluation of earmarked transfers has yet been done, the
Strategy questions whether financing according to the size of the municipality, rather than
number of services, is the right approach. Also, the current system of public procurement
practices favours offers with the lowest price, often without taking into account quality of
the services. There is an undivided opinion that the existing model of financing local social
services did not give the expected results. Nevertheless, there is still no initiative to
thoroughly consider more effective forms of financing local social protection services. This
topic emerges from stakeholders exclusively in a simplified form of distinction between
funding from the central or local level of government. It is unlikely that the central
government will simply take responsibility for financing the local services now used by
more than 25,00040 beneficiaries. Especially bearing in mind that there is a significant
number of potential beneficiaries for whom these services are not currently available.
The strategy points to a number of challenges in the field of childcare. Around 30% of all
beneficiaries in the social protection system are children. The high level of poverty and
poverty risk of families with children was emphasised, which is especially true for families
with more children and families in rural areas. In addition, it points to vulnerable groups
that are not sufficiently recognised in the system or in the public, such as young drug and
alcohol addicts, children caught begging, children from families with unrecognised
paternity. The data show that in recent years the number of reported cases of domestic
violence has increased, the high number of children without parental care, single-parent
families and children with disabilities who cannot join society without support of public
services. The number of children separated from their families and who are in the social
protection system is continuously increasing, despite the decreasing number of children in
the total population. As a result, the number of children under guardianship has increased.
The gap between the decrease in the number of children in the population and the
increase in the number of children in the social protection system indicates an insufficient
level of support for birth families and a lack of integrative services. The strategy draws
attention to the fact that families with children are provided with uncoordinated support
within various systems, and that social protection services in the mandate of local self-
governments in Serbia are underdeveloped and insufficiently accessible. Inadequate
capacity of the Centres for Social Work is especially highlighted. The strategy proposes to
address these challenges through several key areas:
- Improving cash benefits
- Development of sustainable and quality services in the community as a
precondition for continuing and maintaining the process of deinstitutionalisation
- Strengthening the capacity of CSR for integrated planning and support to
individuals and families, but also capacity of other social welfare institutions.
- Improving the system of monitoring needs and goals in the field of social
protection.

38 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
- Integration of services and importing support from the social protection system,
with support and services from other systems
Finally, it should be borne in mind that the draft strategy has not yet been adopted and
that the text has been made on the basis of data from 2016. In the meantime, numerous
legislative acts have been improved and different circumstances have arisen, primarily
those caused by the COVID 19 pandemic. It should be expected that the text of the
Strategy will undergo significant changes until its final adoption
Fiscal strategy
Contrary to the statements in the draft social protection strategy, the fiscal strategy for
202141 does not suggest a planned increase in social protection expenditures. Social
assistance and transfers, excluding expenditures for pensions, were reduced during 2020
by 2.7 billion dinars compared to the projections from the beginning of the year. This is
due to the reduced realization of certain categories of social protection. Such changes are
quite unexpected, given the challenges caused by the epidemic. Projections of the share
expenditures for social protection and transfers in GDP range from 14.1% in 2021, to
13,7% in 2023. Given the expectations of nominal GDP growth in the projected period, it
can be expected that this type of expenditure will remain at approximately the same level.
Given that public organization provide local social services for 58% of beneficiaries, public
employee expenditures should be considered as an important indicator for social
protection. According to the projection from the fiscal strategy for 2021, the share of
public employee expenditures ranges from 10% of GDP in 2021 to 9.6% in 2023. Similar to
expenditures for social assistance and transfers, public employee expenditures will remain
at approximately the same nominal level.
In addition to the above, it should be noted that the Law on Budget System envisages the
continuation of restrictive employment policy in the public sector until 2023. Another
important budget item is the procurement of goods and services, given that this type of
expenditure includes the procurement of social services from private and non-
governmental organizations. As in previous types of expenditures, no increase is projected
here either. The expected share of expenditures for the procurement of goods and
services in GDP for 2021 is 7.6% and 7.1% for 2023, respectively.
Data from the fiscal strategy refer to the entire state budget and do not necessarily reflect
fully on social protection. However, the Government's commitment to keeping
expenditures at the current level is quite clear. The implication for UNICEF is that the
adoption of a social protection proposal with a request for additional resources will need
to be preceded by intensive advocacy and would ideally rely on efficiency gains.
Ministry priorities
A more detailed insight into the priorities of social protection can be gained by reviewing
the budget section of the relevant ministry.42 As a rule, the program structure of the
budget is determined in accordance with the hierarchical functions of the state, the goals
of the Government, i.e. the competencies and goals of the budget users.43 A list of key
competencies is determined based on the legally prescribed competencies of budget
users. Programs are identified in accordance with key competencies and, as far as possible,
linked to the organizational structure to ensure the application of the principle of
organizational responsibility for the implementation of the program. The budget of the
Ministry of Labor, Employment, Veterans and Social Affairs is based on the organizational

43 Available from: Uputstvo za pripremu programskog budzeta.pdf (mfin.gov.rs)
39 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
structure, which, given the complexity of the field of social protection, significantly
complicates the insight into achieving the objectives of relevant public policies.
The budget section of the Ministry contains three programs of importance for the field of
social protection. The "Social Protection" program should be based on the competencies
of the Law on Social Protection, while the "Family Legal Protection" program should be
based on the Family Law. However, these expectations have not been consistently
implemented through program activities. Most of the legal competencies are difficult to
identify in the Ministry's budget section and some are completely invisible. The third
program "Budget Fund for Social Protection Institutions", according to the decision on the
establishment of the fund, relies on the Program for the use of the Budget Fund, adopted
by the Minister. Given that this document, contrary to legal provisions, is not publicly
available, it is not possible to draw appropriate conclusions.
In addition to relying on legal competencies, determining the content of the budget should
be based on the Ministry's medium-term plans and social protection strategy. As
mentioned earlier, the social protection strategy has not been adopted and the ministry's
medium-term plans are not publicly available. The Law on Social Protection introduces the
Social Protection Improvement Program, which should contain measures and activities to
improve existing and develop new social protection services. The program is defined by
the Law on Planning System as a medium-term public policy document that elaborates the
specific goal of the strategy or some other planning document in accordance with which it
is adopted. It is not known whether the Ministry adopts this document and certainly it is
not publicly available or established in the consultative process.
The Ministry of Labor, Employment, Veterans' Affairs and Social Affairs regularly prepares
a performance report, based on the Law on Budget System and the Law on Planning
System. This report should contain qualitative and quantitative indicators of the
achievement of program goals and public policy goals. However, these reports are not
publicly available. Also, during 2020, an Ex-post analysis of the implementation of the Law
on Social Protection was made in accordance with the Law on the Planning System. This
analysis should provide insight into the implementation of measures and activities
established by the Law on Social Protection. In this way, the relevance, efficiency,
effectiveness and sustainability of the Law would be assessed. Unfortunately, as in
previous cases, this document is not yet publicly available.
Austerity
Comparing the planning documents of the Government with the sectoral sources of public
policies and the budget, it is apparent that the harmonisation of the planning documents,
in accordance with the Law on the Planning System, remains a challenge. Also, the use of
data in the planning and evaluation process is not recognized, which significantly hinders
the improvement of the area. The striking lack of transparency further complicates already
complex circumstances. Finally, in order to respond to envisaged economic difficulties
arising from COVID-19 pandemic, as of March 2020 government introduced measures to
support households, firms and basic infrastructure. The whole package of support
measures is large, amounting to 11% of GDP, and will be financed by increase in the
government debt. In June and in December 2020 government provided additional financial
help to certain sectors (hospitality and restaurant industry) and in July additional financial
help to small, medium and some large enterprises. Lockdown will at the same time reduce
the capacity of the economy to contribute to the budget by paying taxes which will further
put a strain of the government’s funds. This could potentially lead to new austerity
measures in the coming period and reduce available funds for social spending. Given that
financial crisis is expected to put largest burden on more vulnerable population, it would
be a challenge to meet increasing needs with fewer resources.

Informal advice obtained as part of this evaluation from a former employee of the Ministry
of Finance, was that UNICEF should start early on with discussions with the Ministry for
Labour, Employment, Veteran and Social Affairs (MLEVSA), meeting with the Ministry in
January to present a project proposal along with the draft budget. MLEVSA is a crucial
point for discussion, not the Ministry of Finance (MOF). MOF only intervenes if the budget
limit for the MLEVSA is surpassed. Regarding the budget UNICEF should have a clear
picture what needs to be funded. In principle, adoption of a project of up to 5 million EUR
would be feasible, co-funded by UNICEF and public money). Intensive lobbying would be
required, oriented to multiple levels including the Minister, Ministerial Assistant, State
Secretaries and advisers in MLEVSA (and other relevant ministries). This would need to be
constant activity until the project is included in the budget of the MLEVSA by September 1.
The aim should be to ensure that modelling activity is including in the government-wide
annual work plan. This is created incrementally over the course of the year, with each
ministry making proposals and the Prime Minister the ultimate decision-maker, although
there is no transparent process for decision-making. Since ministers are accountable to the
Prime Minister for delivery against the annual plan, this is the best representation of a
financial commitment.
41 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
Regardless of the Government's determination to keep expenditures at approximately the
same level in the medium term, the possibility of increasing funds intended for social
protection should not be completely ruled out. However, advocating such a position
requires strong analysis that is primarily based on changing the current paradigm of social
protection. It is clear that this area is perceived as a public expense rather than a public
investment, and so a costed business case needs to be set out. The strength of the
business case and financial analysis is more important than the precise format in which it is
documented.
Advocating the allocation of larger funds for social protection ideally needs to be preceded
by a significantly higher level of harmonisation of planning documents and laws with the
budget programming process. Better data and evidence would certainly contribute to
these aspirations.
Transparency and participation
Numerous efforts were made by the evaluation team to obtain further information from the
Ministry of Finance, Secretariat for Finance of the province of Vojvodina (a provincial arm of
the Ministry of Finance) as well as to the Capital Fund of Vojvodina, without success. This
illustrates previous findings regarding the transparency of the budgetary procedures. The
International Budget Partnership has been running the Open Budget Survey that produces
an Open Budget Index (OBI) since 2008. This measures the state of budget transparency,
participation, and oversight in countries around the world. Questions in the survey address
the public availability and comprehensiveness of the key budget documents that
governments should publish at various points of the budget cycle and whether there are
opportunities for public participation in the budget process. It also examines the roles of
legislatures and supreme auditors in budget formulation and oversight.
Serbia’s OBI score has varied since 2008, as can be seen on the graph, but it has always been
below 60 points (OBI is an index of 0-100 with higher values indicating greater transparency
in budgetary processes and higher public participation).

The 2019 score of 40 points out of 100 in 2019 placed Serbia at 70th place among 117
countries that participated in the survey. A transparency score of 61 or above indicates a
country is likely publishing enough material to support informed public debate on the
42 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
budget.44 Compared to other countries in the region, only Bosnia and Herzegovina
achieved a lower score (33), while Romania (64), Bulgaria (71), Croatia (68), Slovenia (68)
and Albania (55) all fared better. The interpretation of these figures is that the country
provides insufficient information to the public regarding the budget and processes and
that opportunities for public participation in the budget process are almost non-existent
(the score for public participation in the 2019 survey was 2/100).
2.2. Key features of the enabling environment for
modelling
Finally, a number of features of the Serbian national context are relevant to the challenges
and opportunities of modelling, also highlighted in the analysis above and by UNICEF staff
and stakeholders.
Financial constraints
As the analysis above indicates, there are significant financial constraints on public sector
funding, likely to become tighter in response to the funding requirements of the COVID 19
pandemic. Securing additional funding for a policy or service area requires the involvement
of the highest levels of government. The budget is regulated by legislation and the consent
of the Government is required for changes in the budget: approval by individual ministries
is not enough. UNICEF teams and other stakeholders referred to the significant challenge
this imposes.
Frequent changes in key government posts
The dynamic political scene in Serbia is reflected in frequent changes in decision-makers.
Even the contents of key strategic documents do not ensure continuity. Some continuity
can be achieved by maintaining the involvement of public servants whose position is not
tied to changing decision makers. However, these results are limited because the public
administration has a high level of adaptability to the circumstances of political change.
UNICEF teams in particular described the loss of momentum, and sometimes commitment,
that was frequently the result of changes in senior post-holders, and that could be
mitigated only partially by strong relationships with civil servants and consultants.
Limited absorptive capacity of government, not readily open to influence
The government’s absorption capacity is closely linked to frequent changes in decision-
makers. Decision-makers are often not familiar with all the details of the duties they take
on and a significant role is played by the public administration. UNICEF teams and
stakeholders referred to senior levels of government not readily being open to influence,
and to the influence of social movements and professional groups being more limited than
in other countries, although it was said that this is changing with growing social media use.
Constrained service capacity
As the earlier analysis has highlighted, service delivery capacity is limited particularly in key
areas such as Centres for Social Work. National and local stakeholders frequently referred
to service capacity being under considerable pressure and to key professional groups being
under-resourced, exacerbated by constraints of expanding publicly funded posts. There
were also references to specialist service capacity being limited, for example in services for
44 https://www.internationalbudget.org/sites/default/files/country-surveys-pdfs/2019/open-budget-
survey-serbia-2019-en.pdf
43 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
disabled children, youth justice specialist support, and the number of child psychologists
and psychiatrists.
Constrained civil society sector
UNICEF personnel described the civil society sector in Serbia as being more limited and less
influential than in other countries, resulting from political centralisation.
Service provision governed by legislation and regulation and not readily
flexible
The central regulation of service provision, linked with budget control, means that
legislative or regulatory changes is needed to adopt new models or services, in contrast
with other countries where the content of service provision at a local level is a matter for
local discretion.
Intersectoral cooperation constrained national and local levels is
constrained
Intersectoral cooperation is stimulated by regulations or governance. One of the
characteristics of the legislative framework in Serbia is inconsistency of regulations, which,
among other things, causes a lack of cooperation between different sectors. Improving
these circumstances is a complex, time-consuming and uncertain endeavour. Although
cooperation at management level yields some results, these are not necessarily
sustainable. UNICEF teams and stakeholders described intersectoral cooperation as being
more limited than in other countries where models had been implemented – for example,
Portugal and the United States where the ECI model had been used.
Social movements not well established
Traditional social movements have limited influence and variable capacities. For example,
movements such as disability groups or parenting groups which have been influential in
other middle- and high-income countries were described as being very nascent in Serbia.
Poor national data systems
Data management is often unregulated and unrelated to regulations and expected
outcomes, with insufficient discipline in recording and documenting processes. Such
circumstances could be improved by the application of the Law on Planning System and
especially by the development of the practice of making ex-ante and ex-post analyses.
Nevertheless, the full implementation of this Law is a lengthy process that requires a
significant change in public administration practice. National data systems in several policy
areas were described by UNICEF personnel and stakeholders as poor, for example there is
no single system for monitoring the application and outcomes of DMs.

Chapter summary
• Systematic approaches were taken to initiating each of the five models, and
government commitment to modelling was secured at an early stage alongside
extensive consultation with other stakeholders

45 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
• UNICEF was viewed as an energetic and active leader of modelling and modelling
generated high levels of enthusiasm among the stakeholders and partners involved.
• Several of the components that form the core, necessary, elements of models (as set
out in the UNICEF Scale-up Framework) were created through modelling. There were
some gaps: model-level theories of change, specifying core and adaptable
components and fidelity criteria, establishing monitoring systems, and assessment of
costs. Use of the Sine Qua Non in modelling was limited.
3.1. Initiating modelling
The exemplar models reflected UNICEF’s long-term investment in policy and practice
areas. Initiation involved systematic approaches to identify options, including:
• situational analyses and other research to explore gaps in current provision and
unmet needs
• discussions with families, professionals and stakeholders
• reviewing international programmes and delivery systems
• drawing on UNICEF staff expertise.
UNICEF’s stakeholders particularly valued the extent of early collaboration and discussions,
and the involvement of key partners about a potential model. The document reviews and
interviews with UNICEF teams and stakeholders consistently show efforts to involve
government and other stakeholders from an early stage. Annual work plans illustrate that
an explicit joint decision was made with government to embark on modelling.
“We started with a situational analysis of what we have in Serbia, and what we can
use, and how we could support these professionals we have, in what way, and then
we started to build, and at the same time we informed ministries, we worked with
them as an Advisory Board and so on.” System stakeholder
3.2. The approach to modelling
Stakeholder engagement was also a strong component of modelling itself. Both the
UNICEF teams and stakeholders consistently described strenuous efforts to engage
government as well as national sector partners, NGOs and professional associations, with
few references to obvious gaps where partners that should have been included were not.
Advisory groups, working groups and cross-sectoral teams were developed, with teams in
local implementation sites and at national level carrying out coordinated work. This had
raised awareness of the models and motivation to take part in modelling, stimulated new
relationships and local cooperation, and achieved early successes in overcoming potential
areas of resistance.
“So we had the opportunity for practitioners to say how they see the situation, what it
looks like from the position of a practitioner, which of these examples of good practice
we heard about here could be applied, what would be important for us, what would
be significant for us.” System stakeholder
UNICEF teams and stakeholders described UNICEF as very actively involved in modelling,
playing an essential role in leading work, collaboratively developing plans, adapting,
problem-solving, and drawing on the expertise of partners. There were occasional
references to UNICEF not having anticipated all the work needed and other partners
46 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
needing to a little more than they had expected, and to a lack of direction in ECI following
initial training, but generally the work was viewed very positively.
The modelling approach consistently generated high levels of enthusiasm and engagement
from partners. Families and young people do not appear to be directly involved in the
collaborative development of models and there is scope to strengthen co-creation activity
beyond research and consultation.
“We were going back and forth, back and forth. In a way, checking all the time with the
counterparts, with all stakeholders involved, and monitoring, checking if something is
working, what is not working? That was actually, our strategy was also, I guess, to be
present there, together with them, and to jointly go through all the stats, closely
monitor, listen, give, take feedback all the time. I don't know if that is a modelling
strategy, but that is something that we did, when I think about that time [it was] ….
Very intensive, really intensive, because you cannot let things go as they start, and it
cannot be like business as usual. It really needs close, close work in close partnership
with all stakeholders.” UNICEF personnel
“I believe a project with UNICEF always goes okay. They know how to programme a
project.” System stakeholder
A wide range of capacity building methods was described as part of modelling, going
beyond formal training and including country and site visits, coaching and mentoring,
intensive formal and informal communication across teams and with advisory groups,
conferences, seminars and other learning exchange and networking activities.
Stakeholders expressed strong satisfaction with this work, with no obvious exceptions or
gaps.
“All kinds of activities that included education … and trainings and Zoom, and
consultation, supervision, reflection direct, indirect, team meetings, various lectures
…. [We] gained a huge contingent of knowledge. I don’t think we are even aware yet
how much knowledge we have gained.” Local implementation stakeholder
“So my key story is that this project is extremely well designed … and it had so many
instruments, tools, different activities, which really made up one amazing whole of
different activities that contributed and … our mentoring collaboration and how much
we asked the schools what it was, how much we encouraged them to do some new
things, and so on.” Local implementation stakeholder
This satisfaction is also reflected in the survey of local implementation sites. The survey
asked whether implementation sites had received sufficient support to prepare for
implementation. This support had been received by all but one of the 39 participants. As
Table (overleaf) shows, it was judged completely or mainly sufficient by almost all.

3.3. Developing key programme components
The UNICEF Scale-up Framework summarises the key programme components, parts and
resources that need to be developed, and improved, in a programme in order for it to be
ready for scale-up. These include:
• An equity-based theory of change: the importance of a theory of change as an aid
to programme development, testing and scale-up is highlighted by much of the
research that underpins the UNICEF Scale-up Framework
• Specified beneficiaries and outcomes, formulated as child rights realization and
with clarity about whether the aim is to reach the most vulnerable children:
several of the reviewed frameworks46 emphasise the importance of clarity about
the populations to whom a programme is targeted and the intended impacts
• Specified programme content and activities, delivery processes and staff: the
importance of a simplified and standardised programme, clarity about what is
required to prepare for implementation (e.g. staffing levels and training),
activities undertaken (e.g. set out in practice protocols or guidance), and other
resources to support preparation and delivery47
• Specified core/adaptable components. Core components are those elements
deemed to be essential for programme outcomes to be secured. They are
elements that must be delivered, and consistently with the programme
instructions. Adaptable components are elements that can either be modified or
not included. The scale-up literature also highlights the need for clarity about
fidelity criteria and the scope for adaptation: the frameworks reviewed note the
importance of fidelity requirements that can be monitored, and the need for
balance between fidelity and adaptation48
• Monitoring system: so that implementation and performance can be tracked and
improved49
• Assessment of cost of delivery of the scaled-up model: so that the level of
resources required for sustainable and scaled-up delivery are clear50
The partners involved in modelling were generally very positive about the highly
collaborative approach to developing these core components. In some cases, UNICEF led
the development of resources, in others, partners led, but both were described as positive

and effective processes. UNICEF teams and stakeholders described the development of
accredited training programmes, tools for identification or screening of eligible or targeted
children, procedures, standards and guidance, and viewed these components as essential
contributions to their successful delivery of the models.
“You know, when you provide a service you take responsibility for its quality. So you
have to have clear instructions and guidelines.” Local implementation stakeholder
“Like instructions for implementing diversionary measures, the manual, each step
described …. We have all those materials, so any time a new case manager calls us,
we go with them through that, all the steps defined, so they know when to send us
official referral. We have the entire procedure explained in those instruments.” Local
implementation stakeholder
The evaluation team triangulated this interview data with a review of programme
documentation to assess the extent to which the core components had been completed.
Table summarises this analysis. As the table shows, not all components were fully
completed for all models. In some cases, key components appeared to be most fully
described in evaluation reports, suggesting that they may not have been clarified, or
documented, as early in the modelling process as is optimal. It was also not always clear
whether final improved versions had been created which reflected learning from
modelling. This is an important part of optimising a model for scale-up.

Two models, ECI and DOP, had a full model-level theory of change, in both cases
developed at an early stage in model development. The three child welfare team models
(FOW, IFC and DM) were included in wider programme-level theories of change. This is an
49 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
area where practice could be strengthened: a model-level theory of change provides
important clarity about key activities and intended mechanisms for change, intended
outcomes, and necessary conditions for effectiveness. This supports work to evaluate and
strengthen models and provides guidance for scaled-up delivery. This is an area of
UNICEF’s work that could be strengthened.
Box 3.1 The importance of a model-level theory of change
A good theory of change aids:
• Articulation of the underlying logic and theory
• Agreement of realistic outcomes and ambitions
• Understanding of how the model contributes to wider programme-level ambitions
• Consistency in understanding across partnerships and time
• Understanding of necessary enabling conditions and what it will take to implement
effectively at scale including wider activity
• Induction of staff at delivery sites
• Improvement of service delivery and processes
• Focussing evaluations, interpretation of findings, and demonstrates whether a
programme is on track to secure longer-term outcomes
• Identification of core and adaptable model components
• Communication, marketing and advocacy
• Realistic work planning, prioritising and resourcing
The intended beneficiaries and outcomes for some models were set out in model
guidelines (for example IFC). In some cases, however, the evaluation reports were
suggested as the best source of information on beneficiaries and outcomes.
Eligibility criteria and referral processes were generally set out in guidance documents.
Some models had clear procedures for identifying and assessing eligible children or
families. This is important to ensure both that models reach the most marginalised and
deprived children, and that the support provided is effectively tailored to their needs. For
example, DOP includes an instrument to be used by schools to identify children at risk of
school dropout, and IFC uses recommended assessment processes. Stakeholders involved
in DM said that assessing need and defining appropriate rehabilitative activity was an
aspect of the model that needs to be strengthened.
The model elements that were most consistently developed were specifications of service
content and activities, and of the delivery processes involved. These were documented in
guidelines and standards – Table 3.3 shows the approach used in one exemplar model.
Table 3.3 ECI model guidelines
ECI ‘Pilot Implementation Recommendations Action Plan 2-19-20’ sets out:
the background and theoretical basis of ECI, recommended service
structure, step-by-step activities for screening, referral, intake,
assessment, family plan, intervention, service delivery, transition out, and
evaluation. The document also sets out staffing requirements and roles.
Local implementation sites were generally positive about the guidelines and standards
produced for the models. These were an essential implementation resource. There were
some comments from ECI sites that these resources had not been made available quickly
enough following initial training, leaving sites unclear about how to implement what they
50 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
had learnt. In general, however, the resources and their availability were very positively
viewed by stakeholders.
It was noteworthy that none of the documentation of service content and delivery
processes identified gender-specific considerations or adaptations. It might be expected
that these would be particularly relevant for DM (given the low proportion of girls among
juveniles in the justice system which suggests a need for particularly consideration of
relevant rehabilitative activities) and DOP (given the gender implications of issues such as
child labour and child marriage)51.
The models involved aspects of work which could be flexed and adapted to the needs and
circumstances of individual children. The documentation reviewed by the evaluation team,
however, did not include a specification of core and adaptable components and fidelity
criteria. Core components are those that must always be implemented in the same way,
adaptable components are those that are optional or can be adapted. Fidelity refers to
models being implemented as intended, and fidelity criteria set out requirements
particularly for quality aspects that have been demonstrated as key to effectiveness. These
aspects of models are an important aid to scaling-up, relevant both for supporting
effective high-quality implementation and for enabling tailoring for the best fit to local
contexts.
The extent to which models included a monitoring system that would support delivery at
scale varied. Monitoring systems ideally monitor the take-up of the model, services
provided, and progress or outcomes achieved. They may be standalone systems integrated
into the model or may use existing national or service data systems. They need to monitor
gender and other equity dimensions of the reach and implementation of models, as well as
of outcomes. Such monitoring systems provide essential information to inform decisions
about iterative model improvement, scale-up, and a process of ongoing adaptation to
ensure a good fit between the model and the operating context (see further chapter 5 and
7).
Monitoring was particularly noted as a challenge to the DM model where there are two
separate and incompatible systems monitoring the use of DMs, with ad hoc arrangements
for recording the use of DMs in individual cases.
Finally, there was variation in how information about the costs of delivery of a model
adapted for scale-up was addressed in the models. A full costing for delivery at scale was
available only for FOW and DOP. Annex 6 provides further information about key
considerations in costing each of the models.
Cost analyses should be accompanied by a conclusion on cost effectiveness by comparison
with services already in use (see Chapter 4). The existing analyses suggest the reallocation
of funds from existing services to the proposed models. In the previous two decades, there
have been several similar proposals but these have had little success, if any. Future
analyses should focus on identifying how to address obstacles to reallocation of funds. A
key obstacle is the need for increased funds during the transition from existing services to
alternative ones. Conducting cash flow analysis based on an understanding of the public
51 However DOP was subsequently included in a three-year programme addressing child marriage,
currently in the process of external evaluation. The model involves intersectoral interventions at Roma
community, municipal and national level. The DOP model was adapted to focus on child marriage
(including for example tailored professional development and support for school staff, and is being
tested in a further group of schools.
51 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
budget will therefore be important. In addition, the government's restrictive budget policy
calls for increased efficiency, so a strong focus on efficiency will be essential.
3.4. Use of the Sine Qua Non
As noted in Chapter 1, the SQN (Box 3.2) was developed by UNICEF to aid modelling.
Although knowledge of the SQN had informed modelling for some teams to some extent,
none of the teams had used it as key resource in modelling or adhered to it, and not all
UNICEF team members were aware of it. The SQN does not include all the items that scale-
up literature and the interviews suggest are necessary parts of the development and
optimisation of model (see Annex 13 for further discussion of the SQN).

• Although significant evidence was generated in modelling, there were gaps in the
evidence generated
• Evidence about what it takes to implement models well did not cover all necessary
aspects of implementation.
• Evidence about outcomes rarely used using evaluation designs involving comparison
groups, objective or validated outcome measures, or examining longer term impacts.
• Evidence about cost-effectiveness was very limited.
4.1. The need for evidence
This chapter assesses the work undertaken during modelling to build the evidence base for
models. As the UNICEF Scale-up Framework summarises, for an intervention to be ready
for scale-up, evidence is required about three key dimensions:
53 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
• What it takes to implement the intervention: in organisations consistent with
those that will delivery at scale, and under routine operating conditions. Key texts
on which the UNICEF Scale-up Framework is based52 emphasise the importance of
analysing implementation, including in multiple settings, to understand what is
required for effective implementation
• Outcomes: in line with the equity and child rights ambitions of the models and
based on a version of the model that is in line with the intended scaled-up
delivery. This is consistently identified as key information for scale-up, essential
not only to engage government and partners53 but also because proceeding
without sufficient evidence that a model works can lead to scaling-up poor
interventions, leading to wasted resources, missed opportunities and loss of
credibility54
• Cost-effectiveness: assessment of the costs involved in relation to the benefits
secured55 is important to make sound decisions about sustainable funding.
These forms of evidence are important aids to securing commitment to scale-up and to
ensuring that scale-up is well implemented. There were different views from stakeholders
about the extent to which evidence is a strong influence on government. In general, it was
viewed as an important influence on technical staff even where political decision-making
necessarily reflects a wider set of considerations.
Evidence should also influence UNICEF’s decisions about whether and how to scale-up,
highlighting areas for model improvement and the work needed to create the conditions
required for effective implementation at scale.
4.2. The nature and quality of evidence generated
in modelling
4.2.1. Evidence about implementation
Evidence about implementation approaches and challenges was gathered for all the
models (except ECI where the evaluation had not been commissioned). The model
evaluations undertaken were varied in the depth with which implementation was explored
and in the range of implementation challenges identified. For FOW, IFC and DM,
summative thematic evaluations undertaken later in the modelling process, or after
modelling had stopped, identified more challenges than earlier model-specific evaluations.
As Chapter 1 described, implementation science is the body of evidence about what
effective implementation involves and requires. It involves robust evaluation of specific
factors known to be relevant to effective implementation, and thus essential pre-
conditions for effective scale-up, are surfaced and explored. Key constructs from this
evidence are summarised in Box 4.1.

Box 4.1 Implementation evaluations
There is consistent evidence that the level of implementation achieved is a key driver
of the effectiveness of programmes. Robust evaluation of implementation is important
to test and adapt implementation strategies, and to understand how to achieve the
intended programme outcome at scale. Three key areas where theoretically informed
evaluation approaches would be helpful are: determinants of effective
implementation, evaluation outcomes, and stages of implementation completion.
→ Determinants of implementation
There is extensive evidence from effectiveness studies about the factors that
influence or determine successful implementation. Exploring these explicitly
and directly adds rigour and robustness to what? and uncovers issues that
may otherwise be hidden. A widely used, evidence-informed summary of
determinants of effective implementation is the Consolidated Framework for
Implementation Research (CFIR)56. The CFIR identifies the key determinants
of implementation as:
• Intervention characteristics: evidence strength, relative advantage,
complexity, adaptability
• Individuals involved in delivery: their knowledge, beliefs, skills and
willingness to adopt the intervention
• ‘Inner setting’ or delivery organization (e.g. school, Centre for Social Work,
court): culture, readiness and resources for implementation
• ‘Outer setting’ or wider system: policies, legislation, regulation, funding,
social values and cultures, population needs and preferences
• Implementation processes and strategies: including planning, engaging,
capacity building
→ Implementation outcomes
Defining implementation outcomes is important to understand whether fully
effective implementation has been achieved, and the elements contributing
to achieving implementation. A widely used and evidence-informed
taxonomy57 outlines implementation outcomes as:
• Acceptability: the perception among stakeholders that a model is
agreeable, acceptable or satisfactory
• Appropriateness: the perceived fit, relevance and compatibility with
delivery organisations and the wider system
• Feasibility: the extent to which it can be carried out
• Adoption: whether the decision has been made to take-up the innovation
• Fidelity: the degree to which is was implemented as intended
• Cost: the cost-effectiveness or cost-benefit ratio
• Penetration: whether it has become integrated and embedded in the
delivery organisation
• Sustainability: whether it is maintained and continued

55 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
In initial implementation stages, acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility,
adoption and fidelity are likely to be most important, with cost, penetration
and sustainability more important in later stages. UNICEF’s implementation
evaluation would be strengthened by explicit assessment of the enablers and
barriers to, and the extent to which implementation outcomes have been
achieved.
→ Stages of implementation completion
Measuring the degree of completion of implementation and the proportion
of activity completed is also important. A well tested taxonomy58 involves
tracking progress through pre-implementation (engagement, feasibility
assessment, readiness planning), implementation (training staff, establishing
monitoring, beginning delivery, stable stage of delivery) and sustainability
(full competency and embedded delivery). Building assessment of stage
completion into evaluations would help to highlight whether elements of
early stages have been bypassed and delivery begun before necessary
supports are in place, and whether later stages have been reached.
The evaluation team assessed the model evaluation reports to assess the extent to which
key implementation constructs had been addressed and rich data concerning
implementation strategies, determinants, barriers, enablers and outcomes59 generated.
Table 4.1 summarises the evidence generated about implementation for each of the
model programmes.

The evaluation team also reviewed evaluation reports to assess coverage of gender and
wider equality issues. These are key considerations to understanding whether the models
are contributing to narrowing equity gaps, and assessing the effectiveness of processes for
identifying, referring and assessing eligible in reaching the most marginalised children and
families. It was striking that there was almost no coverage of these issues in any of the
model evaluation reports reviewed by the evaluation team. Model evaluations had
generally not looked in depth at the reach of models to the intended participant groups,
and had not examined differential reach by gender or other circumstances.
For example, the first FOW evaluation66 highlights the reach of the model to single-parent
families and the proportion of these which are a mother, and also the proportion of
families in the evaluation who were of Roma culture. There was no systematic gender
analysis nor analysis of the other circumstances of mothers and girls. There are some
insights for Roma parents and children, but no disaggregation by gender. There is similarly
no gender analysis in the later FOW evaluation67 beyond description of the research
sample. The DM summative evaluation68 highlights the absence of specific consideration in
the design of the DM modelling activity and in the 2014 and 2017 evaluations, although
notes that all young people in the justice system can be considered vulnerable. It
concludes that vulnerable groups need to be more of a focus in capacity building activity.
Finally, the DOP evaluation69 also has no analysis of the reach of DOP by gender, nor on

factors for dropout.
4.2.2. Evidence about outcomes
The extent to which there was robust evidence about outcomes varied between the five
exemplar models in terms of features such as whether there was a comparison design
(essential for outcomes to be attributed to models), sample size, the use of objective or
validated outcome measures and the length of follow-up periods. Table 4.2 summarises
the outcomes evidence generated for each of the exemplar models.

Again, it is noteworthy that there was no analysis, in any of the model evaluations, of
outcomes and impacts by gender, nor by other equity dimensions.
There was robust evidence about outcomes for the DOP model, based on a quasi-
experimental design. For FOW, IFC and DMs there was early evidence on outcomes based
on parental or staff perceptions; these evaluations did not involve a comparison design.
The gaps and shortcomings in outcomes data were not generally highlighted by the
UNICEF teams nor in stakeholder interviews. The evaluation approaches used were
generally perceived as sufficient by many of the stakeholders interviewed as well as by the
UNICEF teams. Government was not seen as particularly demanding in its evidence

requirements, and few stakeholders suggested that more robust evidence was needed
either to secure government commitment or to make the case for the models being
scaled-up. However, the approaches used by UNICEF are not consistent with the wider
international evidence about what is required to justify and support scale-up. This is
discussed further in chapter 7.
4.2.3. Evidence about cost-effectiveness
Cost-effectiveness relies on effectiveness evidence: it is a measure of the net cost impact
of the model compared to the counterfactual and depends on robust data about both
costs (discussed in Chapter 3) and effectiveness (discussed in section 4.2.2 above). Limited
data on cost effectiveness was generated for the exemplar models. Table 4.3 summarises
the data generated.

For FOW there is an analysis of the costs of delivery of the model as modelled, with an
estimate of how these might be different for a ‘settled’ version, and analysis of the costs of
the service compared with placement costs which estimates the outcomes needed for the
service to break even (‘threshold analysis’). For IFC there is similarly a threshold analysis.
There is no cost or cost-effectiveness analysis for DM, and none yet commissioned for ECI.
There is some analysis of the costs of a scaled-up model of DOP, but no cost-effectiveness
analysis.
UNICEF’s stakeholders see this as an important area for enhancement of the existing data,
critical to securing Ministerial commitment and to ensure that sufficient funding is made
available for the models to be effective.

d
iD typically, in global scale-up endeavours, an issue where work is needed to strengthen
readiness for scale-up, and this was the case for the UNICEF exemplar models. There
were aspects of all the models that were challenging, given the capacity of delivery
organisations. Tensions also existed in the fit of models with professional and socio-
cultural and norms.
• Each of the models requires intersectoral cooperation (i.e. support from other
services and organisations) and this was widely viewed as not yet sufficiently in place.
• There is a need for changes to legislation or regulation to incorporate the models into
mandated practice, and to secure sustainable funding.
61 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
• The models are clearly viewed as valuable and necessary, however, the system
support required to make them sustainable at scale is not yet in place.
5.1. Why are acceptability and fit important?
This chapter covers the third domain in the UNICEF Scale-up Framework: the extent to
which the models are seen (by policymakers, funders, delivery organisations, families,
communities and influencers) as:
• Relevant and addressing a high priority, equity-based need: the international
scale-up evidence reviewed emphasises the importance of programmes operating
in areas of recognised, sharply felt and persistent need, and where there are clear
gaps in provision77. This is an important starting point for the development of any
model.
• Credible: the evidence refers to programmes needing to be based on theory and
research, and demonstrably effective78
• Having relative advantage over other options and visible benefits: being
preferable to alternatives or to current provision, having evident superiority79
• Acceptable, appropriate, feasible and a good fit with:
o Policy, finance, legislation, regulation: to be scalable, interventions need
to be aligned with policy priorities, requirements and ‘incentives’80, i.e.
what is permitted, funded, encouraged, supported or condoned
o Capacity of delivery organisations and staff: interventions need to be
feasible given the capacity and capabilities of delivery organisations,
convenient to use, placing no or minimum additional burden on
organisations, with complexity in line with their capability81
o Community cultures and preferences: alignment with population
demand and preferences is emphasised by several frameworks82
However, at the same time, interventions, delivery organisations and the wider system (i.e.
policy, finance, legislation, regulations, other services, professional paradigms, community
cultures and preferences) are in a near-constant state of change. This means that
interventions need to be modified, and that delivery organisations and the wider system
also need to change to adapt to the intervention.
The Dynamic Sustainability Framework was used in the evaluation of UNICEF’s approach to
modelling, particularly in analysis of the feasibility and fit of the models and in considering
how far UNICEF’s planning and governance support the dynamic iterative work required.
The following sections of this chapter look first at how the models themselves are
perceived, and then at perceptions of their feasibility and fit to delivery organisations and
the wider system context in Serbia. Chapter 7 reviews approaches to planning and
governance.

Box 5.1 Fit and alignment: The Dynamic Sustainability Framework
The fit of an intervention within delivery organisations (e.g. schools, Centres for
Social Work, courts) and the wider system surrounding them (e.g. policy, finance,
legislation, regulations, other services, professional paradigms, community cultures
and preferences) is a key determinant of sustainability. ‘As a consequence,
assessment of organizational characteristics (e.g., structure, climate, culture,
resources) is seen as an essential component of sustainability, and indeed, the fit
between context and the intervention is at the center of a sustainability phase.’
(Chambers et al. 2013:118). However, since delivery organisations and wider systems
are subject to constant change, this involves an ongoing, dynamic and mutual
process of realignment. This means that approaches that aim to optimise
interventions prior to implementation, independent of context, will not aid
scalability and sustainability. Instead, the process needs to be one of contextually
sensitive programme adaptation to find and sustain fit: ‘… the success of an
intervention to be sustained over time lies in the measured, negotiated, and
reciprocal fit of an intervention within a practice setting and the practice setting
within the larger ecological system.’ (Chambers et al. 2013:121). Figure 5.1 illustrates
this.
Figure 5.1 The Dynamic Sustainability Framework83 (adapted from Chambers
et al., 2013)
This framework endorses modelling in real world contexts as a key stage before scale-
up. Models can be developed in context-specific ways. The Dynamic Sustainability
Framework also highlights the need for dynamic, non-linear approaches to modelling.
This is likely to require a combination of adapting models, building capacity in delivery
organisations, and wider system reform. In particular it means that model design and
adaptation should not be regarded as finite processes. If a model does not fit, it
should be adapted until it does, and adapted as the delivery context changes. As the
delivery context becomes more receptive, the model can be modified to be more
demanding or complex, in line with delivery capability.

5.2. Are the models viewed as relevant, credible
and having clear benefits?
5.2.1. Relevance and addressing a high priority equity-based need
All five models were consistently viewed by stakeholders as relevant and addressing high
priority equity-based needs, in line with the intentions of the UNICEF teams. Although
there were some concerns about feasibility (see below), none of the stakeholders
interviewed viewed any of the models as irrelevant or unhelpful.
The FOW and IFC models were seen by both system stakeholders and local
implementation stakeholders as providing children with complex needs with family
support that is critical for families to stay together, and for state care to be avoided. This
support was seen as clearly need and not otherwise readily available.
"The percentage of children who have developmental difficulties is not so negligible,
and as biological parents … are very often very tired, very often they are worn out, and
this kind of service, how can I tell you, simply taking a break would mean a lot, as well
as support for such families. So the service itself is something that is great for me "
Local implementation stakeholder
Similarly, the DM model was supported by stakeholders for recognising the vulnerability
and needs of children and restorative justice as in line with their best interests. The DOP
model highlighted the factors that lie behind school dropout for vulnerable communities,
and the need for schools to address them.
“So, somewhere in the school collectives, we actually felt how important those children
really are. And then, when we included the numbers, then we saw that the number
was not negligible either. And, in fact, the structure of students, we actually make
them aware so they can see the structure as well, the structure of students, and in
what way, not everyone can rewrite school plans and programmes. And somewhere, in
fact, they have to analyse. Exactly that, when we had this social analysis and the rest,
then we said you have to do that, almost every year before you start planning. Not to
rewrite last year's. So, each school year has its own specifics, let alone each school.”
Local implementation stakeholder
The ECI model focus on early intervention and multi-disciplinary approaches that help
parents to recognise the abilities and potential of children with developmental difficulties,
was applauded.
“This approach to parents, approach to the child, deficit avoidance, and generalization
of the skills a child has is something that is really a big step forward”. Local
implementation stakeholder
All the models were seen by stakeholders and by UNICEF personnel as addressing equity-
based need. This issue was discussed with stakeholders in an open question about equity
and disadvantage, rather than focusing initially on gender. It was noteworthy that none of
the evaluation participants provided commentary about gender in response, commenting
instead on other aspects of equity. The fact that each of the models addressed
disadvantaged children but with quite wide definitions, including children with disabilities
or living in a range of adverse circumstances, as well as Roma children, was noted
positively. Similarly UNICEF personnel generally described the overall equity intentions of
models, rather than focusing on gender.
64 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
‘As for drop out [when she was working in Serbia] I couldn’t really tell you that there
was something that we’re really focusing so strongly on. There were initiatives, but this
was different in the sense that it really focused on those who need something the
most, and it wasn’t on only Roma kids for example but also took into account early
pregnancy, misplaced homes and so on.’ System stakeholder
5.2.2. Credibility
Stakeholders viewed the models as credible in a number of ways. They recognised that the
models were underpinned by theory and evidence, or were based on an existing
programme. They saw them as reflecting an understanding of family needs and family
functioning. They valued the models as child- and family-based, and taking a whole family
perspective, and they viewed them as empowering families and built parenting capacity.
5.2.3. Relative advantage and visible benefits84
The models were all seen by stakeholders as having clear relative advantage in the sense
that they added value to existing services and filled essential gaps. There were no
references to models being similar, or inferior, to standard practice or to other
innovations, and they were consistently seen as improving what was otherwise available.
They were also seen as producing benefits – at multiple levels – that are visible to the
practitioners and system stakeholders. These reflected the models’ intended outcomes
and included enhancing children’s development, learning and social and community
engagement, supporting families to stay together (especially FOW and IFC), helping
parents to develop new skills, approaches and understanding of children (FOW, IFC and
ECI), and helping children and parents to access further service and community support.
These perceived benefits include but go beyond the outcomes evidenced in model
evaluations
"All of us really had faith that it was a good thing, that we were doing good things. All
of us from the team who...and those who were indirectly involved …. And we received
confirmations from everyone who had some contact with this service, primarily from
families and children". System stakeholder
“I strongly believe that there is no greater benefit or satisfaction than that when you
see your child progressing, and I have an impression that we do some useful and
important things, not only for the family in question, but for the community as well.“
Local implementation stakeholder
The positive regard for the models is reflected in the survey data (Table ).

5.3. Are the models viewed as acceptable,
appropriate, feasible and a good fit?
The acceptability of a programme to the communities that are intended to deliver and use
it, and the fit of a programme to the intended delivery organisation and wider system, are
key determinants of scalability.
From the accounts of UNICEF personnel and those of stakeholders (particularly system
stakeholders involved in the initiation of models), it was clear that the UNICEF models
were not designed primarily to fit easily and without friction in the current system, but to
change, improve or reform it. UNICEF staff emphasise that their role is to advance child
rights in areas where they are not being supported. They described giving careful thought
to how to adapt models to the Serbian context, and basing them in existing services rather
than creating new independent services that would be permanently led by UNICEF or an
NGO. In this way, each of the models introduces new ambitions for children, and new
paradigms for professional work, and thereby they deliberately and constructively push
the system towards improvement (see Box 5.2).
66 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
Box 5.2 What is systems change?
→ What is systems change?
UNICEF’s ambitions in Serbia are wider than the scaled-up delivery of
effective models. Although this is an important part of the ambition,
the real goal is systems change. Systems change is ‘an intentional
process, designed to alter the status quo by shifting and realigning
the form and function of a targeted system’.85 UNICEF’s ambitions are
in line with the growing body of literature that makes the case that
even the most effective programmes, on their own, will not be
sufficient to achieve changes for whole populations.
Key aspects of the wider system that emerge from this study as most
relevant are aspects of delivery organisations (e.g. capacity, skills, and
ways of working), aspects of the wider system (e.g. funding, policy,
legislation, regulation, intersectoral cooperation, national data
system, professional paradigms and family values and norms). These
are the dimensions that ‘hold in place’86 a social problem, and that
need to be addressed to solve the problem and make space for a
proven model as part of that solution.
The interviews also highlighted difficulties in the acceptability and appropriateness of the
models, and in relation to their feasibility and fit. Stakeholders identified limiting factors
that are relevant considerations in assessing readiness and requirements for scale-up.
“[Situational analysis] confirmed actually what we knew, that the practice in the
country is not in line with modern approaches when it comes to support to families of
children with developmental difficulties and disabilities, that we are starting, from the
point of early identification, with a very weakened process, despite some progress that
has been made in the past years, that the concept is not at all family-centred … it's not
strength-based, and all the weaknesses that actually were the critical, critical
components of an effective approach in actually changing or supporting families with
children with developmental risks.” UNICEF personnel
5.3.1. Acceptability and appropriateness
The models were universally viewed by stakeholders as meeting important needs and
making a difference. They were also recurrently viewed as a positive challenge to the
system in that they implicitly questioned both family and professional cultures. For
example, the FOW, IFC and ECI models were valued by stakeholders for aiming to grow
parents’ expectations about the abilities and possible lives of children with disabilities. The
DM model was seen as constructively exposing professionals to different ways of thinking
about the causes of children’s offending and the value of restorative rather than punitive
approaches.
"A child from zero to three years of age is not a small man, and it is not true that there
is time for him/her, so even if something is wrong, time will do its thing …. Because the
misconception is that there is time for a child, that older children should be educated,

schooled and invested in, that is only a baby, this one has time, he/she has just started
walking, he/she is just crawling and so on.” Systems stakeholder
At the same time, these aspects of models were seen as exposing ways in which the
system is not yet ready for them. It is important to note that these views were not
universally held, and some stakeholders – both system stakeholders and local
implementation partners – saw models as being implementable at scale without significant
social and attitudinal difficulties to overcome. For example, there were concerns that the
FOW, IFC and ECI would not be viewed as acceptable by some parents because they
challenge conceptions of their child’s capabilities. Stigma about the use of out-of-family
care was also thought to mean some families, who would benefit from IFC, had chosen not
to use it.
"Most often, parents who take care of children with disabilities … are focused on what
the child cannot do and not on what the child can do. So we had some disagreements
with them that when we try to … see what the potentials are that we had certain
problems there to convince the parent who lives all his life on that mode that the child
cannot do something and that some helper is always needed for almost everyone, that
we had certain obstacles there." Local implementation stakeholder
The models were also seen as questioning some aspects of professional paradigms or
norms. ECI was seen as a very new approach for professionals, which meant extensive
training was needed to introduce and embed early intervention principles. Stakeholders
talked about DMs not being used by judges and prosecutors because the shift in thinking
from punitive to restorative justice approaches had not been made. A challenge to DOP
that was noted was that some teachers have a limited conception of the role, focused just
on teaching and not including responsibility for ensuring that schools are accessible to
students and reducing drop-out. This was contrasted with the need for what UNICEF
describe as ‘a more democratic school culture’.
Again, these issues were not a concern for all the stakeholders interviewed. Some felt that
the degree of challenge to professional norms was not significant, or that the value of
these new ways of working would quickly outweigh enthusiasm for existing paradigms.
However, for others they were more significant concerns.
“What turned out to be one of the most important problems in that school … is that
almost two thirds of the employees travel, and they perceive school as something
where they go, work and return home …. [M]y position is, in fact, that the vocation of a
teacher is in fact you are a teacher not only when you are in the classroom, you are
also a teacher on the street, and wherever you are… And that turned out to be a great
weakness, for any serious work and the implementation of anything, anything more
serious, so that something could come to life.” Local implementation stakeholder
The UNICEF teams were clearly aware of these issues and addressed them through the
training and capacity building, which was an important component of each model, and
through advocacy and communication. In addition, there were plans to link with
universities and other professional training institutes to strengthen early intervention and
child development as components of initial and in-service training, and to extend training
for judicial professionals in youth justice and child rights.
“[We] tried to ensure from the very beginning, that we have people who are engaged
that are … from the universities that are training these professionals who are key
professionals in the application of service, so that we can also have some discussion
68 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
around how these new practices can be brought to the level of university training for
these professionals in the future. Because if we stay only in very intensive capacity-
building that is provided by international partners, and even by national partners if
there is a training of trainer, it's not going to be sufficient to really scale that up
throughout the country, and to even have a broader understanding among the
professionals. Because what the model is doing is - there is one very challenging part,
and this is kind of a changing completely the paradigm of work, and paradigm of how
services are provided.” UNICEF personnel
5.3.2. Feasibility and fit
The fact that models are designed to improve rather than fit the current system also raises
issues in relation to feasibility for and fit within delivery organisations.
Capacity of delivery organisations
A recurrent issue highlighted by local delivery sites and system stakeholders was the
capacity of delivery organisations to take on the work involved in delivering the model.
This reflected existing work burden – for example Centres for Social Work were repeatedly
described as being “overwhelmed” or “overloaded” – but it was also related to the unusual
intensity of work with families required by the models. Although intensive family support
was seen as necessary, and a positive feature of the models, it was perceived as
challenging in practice. The availability of the necessary staffing resource was an issue for
several of the models, as Table summarises.
Table 5.2 Staff capacity issues
FOW Capacity of FOW service providers to supervise FOW work.
(In addition, capacity for Centres of Social Work to provide assessment care
planning and monitoring services. Additional staffing would be provided by
new Child and Family Centres. (UNICEF have estimated the number of staff
needed in the new Centres to provide FOW.))
IFC Capacity of Centres for Foster Care and Adopt to assess and train new foster
carers and provide support and oversight.
(In addition, current foster care regulations need to be modified to reduce the
burden of assessment and training, and to ease the administration of monthly
payments to foster carers, and to provide more generous payment)
DM Capacity of Centres for Social Work to assess children and determine
appropriate rehabilitative activity, oversee activity, and provide activities
where no other provider is available.
Capacity of other organisations to provide appropriate activities
ECI Capacity of paediatricians to undertake assessments of children to identify
developmental delay.
Capacity of ECI team members to undertaken ECI work including home visits
alongside other duties
DOP Capacity of school staff to assess risk of school dropout, develop plans, liaise
with other organisations providing support, and provide and oversee
prevention work
"When we started implementing the service, due to the lack of staff, it was the biggest
drawback because it was necessary to appoint a foster care counsellor, who would
monitor the family, otherwise our counsellors are already burdened with monitoring
standard families. Also, a team had to be provided to assess the families who apply to
provide service, which included the appointment of a psychologist and a pedagogue, as
69 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
well as a social worker. So those were all additional calls, and additional obligations
and a lack of staff.” Local implementation stakeholder
“Because if the people don’t have enough time do the ECI and it is just added to their
already – they’re overwhelmed already and if this is just added to their duties, nothing
will really happen.” System stakeholder
“We will gain nothing if we send over 25 questionnaires to a paediatrician who has
thirty or twenty-five children today. He or she will absolutely not fill them out.” System
stakeholder
There were also areas where the models were viewed by local and system stakeholders as
not consistent with existing roles and skills. Carrying out a robust assessment of a child or
family’s circumstances and needs was seen as an essential part of most of the models, and
the availability of appropriately skilled staff was a concern. As a result, some organisations
had used or taken on specialists to carry out assessments. The ECI model was adopted
from Portugal and the United States, where multi-disciplinary teams already exist. The
amount of training needed for Serbian professionals to be ready for the model was viewed
as challenging, and the work was seen as much more complex and intensive than the usual
work of the professionals involved.
The UNICEF teams were aware of these issues, although in general did not describe them
as emphatically as some stakeholders, nor see them as significant challenges to scale-up to
the degree that learning from implementation science would suggest. The issues were
highlighted in strategic programme evaluations, but only some were identified in earlier
model evaluations.
It is also important to note that these issues were balanced with an overall positive
perception of the models. Thirty of the 39 survey participants were continuing to deliver
the model, and generally it was viewed as a good fit with working practices in the
organisation, and as relatively simple to deliver, as Table 3 and Table show. Almost all
survey participants felt the model should continue to be implemented in their
organisation. The barriers to sustained delivery identified by survey participants reflect
those identified in the qualitative research (this and the next section), particularly lack of
staff capacity; fit of model requirements with working hours and workload; lack of
awareness of the needs addressed by the model among staff, and lack of motivation to
implement it; and limited intersectoral support.

Availability of intersectoral cooperation and support
The models were often valued by stakeholders for taking a holistic approach to family
needs, in line with UNICEF’s intentions. This meant that they generally required support
from other services that are not the main provider. Intersectoral support in Serbia was
widely seen as weak and needing to be strengthened. UNICEF staff described models as
deliberately aiming to simulate cooperation, and the success of this was highlighted by
stakeholders.
“We knew from the studies that were done that there is also [a need for] inter-sectoral
cooperation and that without that the dropout prevention cannot function. So as well,
the dropout prevention, as we knew from the literature, it is not related only to one
sector, it has to do with social welfare mostly and the health system in some cases.”
UNICEF personnel
“We are always talking about intersectoral collaboration, so all three sectors [health,
education and social welfare] get to collaborate together, which is not common in our
country, and so this is a bit of change of practice in general, at local and also at
national level, which is not easy to achieve.” UNICEF personnel
However, gaps and weaknesses in intersectoral collaboration were seen by stakeholders as
potentially problematic for scale-up. The extent to which this was viewed as a potential
obstacle varied, but for some stakeholders the degree of concern expressed was
significantly greater than that expressed by UNICEF teams.
It was a particularly significant issue for the implementation and scale-up of DMs, where
stakeholders described difficulty in accessing the range and quality of rehabilitative
activities needed. For example, gaps in available provision included: psycho-social
interventions for youths and families; addiction and rehabilitation services; mental health
services; other health services; community-based volunteering activity; educational
support, and work placements. UNICEF’s modelling of DMs was seen as having prompted
significant improvements in local cross-sector cooperation. Further work was being taken
forward by local leaders in some areas to stimulate cooperation, and the Judicial Academy
had also organised a series of roundtables to prompt local cooperation. However, the
constrained availability of rehabilitative activities was seen as a significant issue for
scalability.
“Most of these diversionary orders cannot be actually implemented because of lack of
organisational capacity …. A lot of judges understand the value of it, but they cannot
prescribe it because they know it will not be carried out. There is no capacity for it in
that municipality, or it will be such a burden to the child to go [far] away to give him
[something not meaningful] to do – so they fine him or something like that.” System
stakeholder
Stakeholders also described difficulties in accessing support for families as part of FOW,
support for foster carers involved in IFC, and support for schools to tackle issues identified
by the DOP model.
“... some foster families really … very quickly gave up, recognising essentially that what
we said during the training about the promised support is missing." Local
implementation stakeholder
71 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
“Somehow this inter-sectoral cooperation is not functional …. [I]t is interesting how it is
difficult for sectors to cooperate and how it is difficult to do things that they need the
inter-sectoral cooperation.” UNICEF personnel
The survey findings reflect a rather more positive account of local cooperation, although it
was not possible to explore the issue in depth there. Twenty-two of the 39 survey
respondents indicated that other organisations were involved in the delivery of the model.
The quality of cooperation was mainly seen as very or quite good as Table 5.4 shows.

Fit with policy, finance, legislation and regulation
In the Serbian context, policy, finance, legislation, and regulation are particularly closely
linked since the work of public services is set out in legislation and regulation. This also
determines the available funding, with only limited local discretion for service innovation.
This explains why each of the models, to be successfully implemented and scaled up,
would require legislative and regulatory change.
Although considerable work was undertaken by UNICEF to engage government
representatives in modelling in the initiation phase, the models did not generally reflect
issues that were already recognised as government priorities. They served the purpose
more of raising the profile of particular needs or sowing the seeds for a new ambition. This
was viewed as a strength of UNICEF’s work, in the sense that its role is not to execute
agreed government priorities or strategies. But it was also recognised as a vulnerability in
modelling, with a view that although UNICEF’s role is to change government priorities,
more work is needed to align models with existing priorities.
“I think in a middle-high country like Serbia the expectation of our partners is that our
country office obviously doesn't do service delivery but does modelling from which they can
draw inspiration …. But it's very important in this type of geography that actually, the
government is always in the lead, and that we make sure that modelling happens in the
context of the prioritisation that they have done …. [I]in the past some of the models were
not completely owned by the government …. We have tried things to contextualise things
that we know work, for instance in the area of child development, for instance in the area
of preschool, but [the] timing didn't fit the prioritisation of the government.” UNICEF
personnel
Table provides a summary of the legislative and regulatory change requirements for each
model to be scaled up. The colour of text indicates the extent to which changes have been
made, red indicating that they have not (FOW and IFC), amber that some of the necessary
legislation has been enacted (DM and DOP). ECI is shown in grey and regulatory changes
are anticipated but not yet know.
72 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
Table 5.5 Legislative and regulatory change requirements
FOW Regulations have been drafted to embed FOW in the work of new Child and Family
Centres and secure national funding. These have been agreed in principle by
working groups including the Ministry but have not been adopted. As a result,
delivery has ceased in the original modelling areas except Novi Sad
IFC Regulations have been drafted to amend existing foster care and embed IFC in the
work of Centres for Foster Care and Adoption. Again these have been agreed in
principle by working groups including the Ministry but not adopted. Regulatory
change is needed to the requirements for assessment, training and monitoring of
foster carers as they were seen as unnecessarily demanding for intermittent care
from people who are often family members. Regulations for arrangements for
payments to foster carers also need to be changed. Currently, each time the
number of nights of foster care changes, a new assessment of payment
requirements has to be made, creating a significant administrative burden. As a
result, new families are not being taken on in the original modelling areas, except in
Novi Sad
DM DMs are enacted in legislation, but the funding of rehabilitative activities is not
mandated and there is not yet agreement where financial responsibility sits.
Stakeholders consider that national rather than local funding is needed to ensure
sustained availability
ECI Legislative change requirements are not yet known but are likely to be significant,
to embed early intervention and multidisciplinary working in the service system and
provide for funding
DOP The requirement for schools to incorporate dropout prevention activities (such as
risk assessments) into individual education plans has been adopted into law,
although without the volume of school training that UNICEF judged necessary
For some models, the need for cross-Ministry alignment and cooperation was an added
issue to be addressed. For example, rehabilitative DM activities are beyond the remit of
the Ministry of Justice (the lead Ministry). Similarly, issues beyond the remit of the Ministry
of Education relevant to DOP include the availability of local transport, homelessness, the
pressure for children in families in poverty to do paid work, and labour market conditions.
Addressing these issues requires a wider portfolio of work including advocacy – see further
chapters 5 and 7.
5.4. Implications for modelling
Overall, the UNICEF models were viewed as relevant, credible and having visible relative
advantage. However, there are issues relating to their feasibility and fit within the wider
Serbian system, which would constrain their scalability and so need to be addressed to
increase readiness. Delivery of FOW and IFC largely ceased after the modelling period
except in Novi Sad, where stakeholders said that there is a strong visionary local leadership
and support for innovation. Implementation of ECI had stopped following initial training in
a few areas or institutions. The uneven use of DMs across Serbia reflects different levels of
enthusiasm for the model among local judiciary and prosecutors, which in turn reflects the
availability of the necessary activities. The quality of DOP implementation was seen as
dependent on the individual motivation among school staff to use the model fully.
“With any project, the scope is limited, the impact is limited to those where they work.
You can see by the statistics – where [UNICEF] worked, it was good; in the parts [of the
73 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
country] that they didn’t work, nothing changed. That’s one of the basic issues with all
development projects, is sustainability, as always, it’s like a mantra …. If institutional
actors do not pick it up, and blow it up on the bigger stage, then it just falls. Most of
the things that UNICEF did then were great examples, but I don’t see that it was picked
up by the system.” System stakeholder
“Well, I think that it was personal motivation of professionals that joined this
programme, is the most important thing and also the support of the management of
institutions. Without support of direct managers of primary health services, and pre-
school institution and centre for social work, it would not be done.” Local
implementation stakeholder
The data suggests that the service, and wider system, in Serbia are not yet fully ready for
the exemplar models and are vulnerable to push back from the system – see Box 5.3.
Box 5.3 How systems neutralise innovation
→ The systems immune response87
Scaling is far from a linear inevitability, and innovation (a new
intervention, service or approach) is frequently stymied or blocked
by the surrounding system. This is particularly the case where an
innovation disturbs the current system and requires it to change to
support the innovation, if the necessary commitment to change
has not been secured. Donella Meadows, a leading theorist on
systems thinking, refers to this as ‘systemic policy resistance’88
which she sees as arising where there are discrepancies in goals:
‘Such resistance to change arises when goals of subsystems are
different from and inconsistent with each other’.
→ ‘Bad systems trump good programmes’
Drawing on evidence about failures to scale up programmes, the
leaders of a philanthropic foundation in the United States highlight
the need for system reform for effective programmes to reach scale.89
‘We have seen how bad systems trump good programs, even when
we have effective interventions.’

• UNICEF is viewed as being in a strong position to secure commitment to scale-up from
a range of stakeholders, having strong relationships with government and other key
bodies and being highly regarded for its professional wisdom.
• UNICEF have generally been successful in securing commitment for modelling, and
has secured commitment to supporting scale-up from some stakeholders, but
government commitment to modelling has not always translated into commitment to
support scale-up.
• Stakeholders encourage UNICEF to continue with and amplify direct government
advocacy, but also to recognise and support other organisations that can advocate, for
the same ambitions, to government.
75 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
• Stakeholders also encourage UNICEF to work more actively in support of changing
social norms and influencing behaviours, through marketing and communications in
addition to advocacy.
• Advocacy and communications activity is not always aligned and integrated with
modelling activity in UNICEF’s governance documents and UNICEF personnel highlight
a need for better integration of these activities.
6.1. Securing commitment: why it matters
Scaling-up initiatives, interventions or programmes requires multiple, committed
individuals and organisations to make it happen, particularly at a system level.
Commitment is an ongoing process rather than a single event. The evidence on which the
UNICEF Scale-up Framework is based highlights that commitment is needed from UNICEF
itself recognising that capacity and resources are finite and prioritisation is needed90; policy
makers91; funders92; delivery organisations93 directly implementing the model or whose
services support it at scale, and wider practice influencers94: experts or other stakeholders
in the field who influence wider practice. Their commitment is needed for:
• An agreed target for scale95: a clear, intended goal or vision for the model that is
quantifiable and measurable. This should include the scale of reach intended,
whether focusing on the most vulnerable or on all eligible children, and the
organisations to be involved
• An agreed pathway for scale96: whereas the target for scale is the ‘what’, the
pathway for scale is the ‘how’. It outlines the ‘end game’ for the model’s success
(e.g. policy, legislative or regulatory change to institutionalise the model, or
delivery at scale by a particular set of organisations, or incorporation into
mainstream practice). The pathway maps out the types of changes needed to
reach the end game, and a planned set of activities. It also needs to set out the
expectations of committed partners in this effort, so that roles, responsibilities
and accountabilities are clear.
• Funding97: both for scale-up activity (activities such as preparation, training,
recruitment and advocacy are critical to a successful scale-up effort and should be
considered ‘actual work’ that is budgeted for, detailed and resourced) and for
sustained delivery at scale. Funding needs to be proportionate to the goal and
timeline outlined in the target and pathway for scale-up.
• Policy, legislation and regulatory change98: a key aspect of scale-up particularly in
the Serbian context.
• Capacity building99: such as requirements to extend workforce size and skillset,
training required, exchange of learning, development of good practice and so on.

Of these, government buy-in or political will was viewed by UNICEF teams and
stakeholders as the most impactful commitment – because it is here that the decisions
that determine the future of a model rests. However, interviewees noted that it can also
be the most sensitive type of commitment to achieve and maintain, given changes in
personnel and priorities.
6.2. To what extent has UNICEF secured
commitment?
Looking across the aspects of scale-up for which commitment is needed:
• In all the models, the stakeholder interviews suggest there was commitment to
the target for scale, in the sense of the social problem to be addressed and the
target population (although this was not generally expressed in model
documentation or by interviewees in quantifiable or measurable terms).
• There was agreement about the pathway for all models except ECI (since this
issue had not yet been resolved), in the sense that there was consensus about
where in the delivery system the model should be delivered at scale, and the
organisational and other changes required for this. It was agreed that FOW
should be delivered by the new Child and Family Centres, IFC within the foster
care system, DMs by the judicial system and DOP by schools. There was less
consistent agreement about the underlying systems changes needed for this to
be effective, such as the need for development of rehabilitative activities to
support DMs.
• Agreement to funding delivery at scale had not been fully achieved. For FOW and
IFC, the agreed amendments to legislation to embed FOW and IFC in funded
services have not yet been enacted. For DM, judicial system funding was in place
but not sufficient funding for rehabilitative activities. DOP was part of funded
school activity, but there is a need for expanded funding both for training and
support, and for services to support students at risk of drop-out.
• The necessary policy, legislative and regulatory change for scaling up DM and DOP
had been secured, but those for FOW and IFC had not been enacted, and for ECI
the requirements were not yet known
• Finally, commitments to capacity building were also not fully in place. Non-
government partners with capacity building roles in modelling were generally
willing and expecting to continue providing this if funded. Government
stakeholders generally saw capacity building as to be funded and managed by
UNICEF or another part of the system.
Table outlines the indicative status of each of the models regarding commitment secured,
based on interviews with UNICEF personnel and stakeholders and analysis of model
documentation.

6.3. How has UNICEF secured commitment
6.3.1. UNICEF’s advantageous legacy position in Serbia
UNICEF was viewed by stakeholders as relative mainstay organisation in the Serbian
political context, and well placed to facilitate commitment and partnerships between
government, national sector organisations, research institutes, professional groups, NGOs
and the public. UNICEF was highly regarded as having strong relationships with both
government and other key organisations. Indeed, it is seen as the constant presence over
decades in which there have been significant changes. The technical and context-based
understanding and wisdom of the UNICEF team in Serbia means it was seen as a source of
expertise for government as well as a powerful conduit for information and
communication.
“We have a strong UNICEF office here in Belgrade and most of the people have been
working there for years. Probably we have there some people who are longer [more
experienced] in this topic, than anyone from the Ministry. So, they are really deeply
understanding [of] all circumstances in social welfare in Serbia and childcare … I think
that decision-makers are using their [UNICEF staff’s] experience very much. At the
78 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
beginning of each government, most important decision-makers in social welfare and
childcare are trying to catch as much as possible from the experienced person from
UNICEF.” System stakeholder
“Civil society organisations are not very famous in Serbia, so UNICEF had a big role to
put together different systems; they have authority to do that. People trust them…
They have the channels and means to motivate [sectors and ministries].” System
stakeholder
6.3.2. Securing commitment to modelling
As noted in chapter 3, UNICEF secured the commitment of a wide range of stakeholders to
modelling and demonstrated a sophisticated network of connections and partners in
different service settings. Key ministries appeared to be securely committed to modelling,
reflected in annual work plans agreed with the lead ministry. As Table 6.2 shows, some
ministries were engaged in modelling for more than one model (DMs, ECI and DOP). The
stakeholder interviews and interviews with UNICEF personnel indicated that secondary
ministries were not always as clearly and actively committed to modelling.
Table 6.2 Government Ministries engaged in modelling
Model Ministries involved as partners
FOW Ministry of Labour, Employment, Veterans and Social Affairs
IFC Ministry of Labour, Employment, Veterans and Social Affairs
DM Ministry of Justice Ministry of Labour, Employment, Veterans and
Social Affairs
ECI Ministry of Health Ministry of Education
DOP Ministry of Ministries of Youth and Sport & Health (part of
Education model advisory group)
Finally, other stakeholders, both national systems-level and local implementation partners,
were generally strongly committed to modelling and, as noted in chapter 3, were of the
view that all the necessary partners were appropriately engaged.
6.3.3. Securing commitment to scale-up
UNICEF is viewed by stakeholders as having worked energetically to secure government
partnership and commitment to scale-up, including aligning models and the language used
to government priorities. Other stakeholders, including NGOs, service providers and
institutes rely on UNICEF and their ability to be ‘in the room’ regularly, continuing the
dialogue with the most influential policy makers on their behalf.
However, government commitment to modelling did not always translate into
commitment to scale-up or the wider systems change needed to support it. Interviews
with stakeholders suggested that government and some other organisations differentiate
79 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
commitment to modelling and scale-up as discrete stages, while for other stakeholder
groups (some organisations, individual professionals and the public), the differentiation is
less stark. The evaluation data suggest a spectrum of forms of commitment with:
• at one end of the spectrum, commitment to modelling but not clearly to scale-up
or systems change (the perceived position of Ministries)
• at the other end, commitment to a shared systems change ambition (the position
for example of other NGOs and of some local or national implementation
partners)
• and in between, commitment to scale-up but not necessarily enrolment in
UNICEF’s wider systems change ambition.
Although commitment across the spectrum will be important for scale-up, this rather
mixed picture meant that there was not always clarity about roles, responsibilities and
lines of accountability for scale-up.
Across the models, there was a perception among UNICEF teams and non-government
partners that ministerial commitment to scale-up is ‘declaratory’ rather than full. There
appeared to be a disconnect between decisions about modelling and plans for scale-up. To
a degree for all models, government commitment was seen to have faltered before
sustained implementation or scale-up is achieved. However, stakeholders also believed
that UNICEF had not yet exhausted opportunities to secure this commitment and should
continue with and extend its work with government.
“It is not possible to expect that they [government] will [commit] just because they
have finally understood that it’s good and useful, so a little bit of advocacy and show-
and-tell is much needed in this regard.” System stakeholder
There appeared to be several reasons for the perceived lack of government commitment;
most notable though is that key senior ministry appointments and relevant ministerial
priorities have changed and consequently, model(s) in the same system are no longer as
high a priority.
“The Family Outreach Worker is actually the example where I think they cornered every
aspect before starting the pilot. They had the commitment of government, they had
the funding from the EU, and EU pushing the government as well. They documented it
very thoroughly. They did the evaluation. They costed it. And still nothing happened.”
UNICEF personnel
Multiple ministerial input, sometimes coupled with perceptions of poor cooperation
between ministries, has sometimes meant that no clear lead partner was identified or that
it remained unclear for stakeholders what scale-up would require. Some interviewees
noted that, even among only the exemplar models in this evaluation, some operate within
the same sectors and so are competing with the same ministries for priority, capacity,
finance and commitment.
These findings are particularly significant since, as discussed in chapter 5, UNICEF’s
ambition is for systems change. This suggests a need for UNICEF to ensure government
buy-in and commitment is based on a longer-term vision, systems change and, crucially,
what is required for it to happen.

6.4. Opportunities to strengthen commitment
6.4.1. Strengthening government advocacy
There is strong support for UNICEF’s political advocacy work to be continued, and whilst
some stakeholders were impressed by the work UNICEF had done, others wanted it to be
amplified in relation to all five models, actioning the work set out in Table 4.4 in chapter 4.
Some stakeholders emphasised the need for UNICEF to re-double its efforts given the
frequent change in government personnel and priorities, recognise the need to continually
form new connections, and to be proactive in anticipating or bracing for a change of
priority. Although they recognised they may not be sighted on all of UNICEF’s advocacy
activity, they saw a need for more advocacy and for it being more visible to partners, as
summarised by a system stakeholder below.
“UNICEF is acting like there is a strong continuum [continuity] here in Serbia in the last
20 years, which is actually not true. Each next government can accept everything from
the past or can reduce or refuse everything from the past. So, it is not true or at least it
would be wrong to think that there is a strong [continued relationship] in the last 20
years; and UNICEF is acting like there is. Their [UNICEF’s] attitude is we made
something [with government] ten or fifteen years ago. We are not going to do that
again. I understand their attitude and from their point of view they are probably right.
However, from my point of view or from the point of view of professional needs, I
would like to see them being more active in terms of advocacy.” System Stakeholder
UNICEF personnel noted a need for more nuanced and systematic analysis of the
(changing) political context to identify synergies, potential blockages and potential
influencers. They described instances where modelling had moved forward without
sufficient early work to build political demand and synergy. UNICEF leaders emphasised
the importance of aligning models, from the start, with existing government priorities or
incentives (i.e., what is encouraged, supported, valued and permitted). Teams recognised
the need to be agile in how they position a model to align with government or ministerial
priorities and commitments either within the sector, or to the model itself. For example,
DOP was initially not linked with inclusive education as it was not a focus in government at
the time100.
“So we proceeded with the modelling without actually preparing the advocacy first ….
Sometimes the model came at the wrong moment, where the issue was not [yet] on
the agenda at the time.” UNICEF personnel
“I think, frankly speaking, what is lacking at the onset of a development of pilots in
Serbia is this political analysis, first of all, and who are the movers and shakers that we
need to mobilise to make sure there is this ownership at the beginning.” UNICEF
personnel
100 This also reflected the fact that the drop-out prevention agenda was initially separate from inclusive
education at UNICEF Regional Office level. The Serbian Country Office was the first office to align
inclusive education with drop-out, in co-operation with the Regional Office.
81 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
UNICEF staff and others emphasised the importance of input from senior UNICEF leaders
for these efforts, and to address cross-sectoral issues which are handled at the highest
levels of government.
6.4.2. Strengthening financial advocacy
UNICEF personnel and stakeholders viewed political and financial advocacy as closely
connected: policy and legislative change that secures a model as part of mandatory
practice is linked to ensuring it is funded through national budgets. This was a clear part of
the scale-up strategy for FOW and IFC, for example.
For DMs and DOP, political and financial advocacy are entwined in that securing DMs and
DOPs as part of the juvenile justice and school systems by definition secured their funding.
The key issues for continued financial advocacy, however, is funding for rehabilitative
activities in the case of DM, and social provision in the case of DOP. Despite the close
involvement of the Ministry of Justice, stakeholder interviews suggest that the government
expectation is that funding for rehabilitative activities should be a municipal responsibility,
and funding for capacity building the responsibility of UNICEF.
Finally, for ECI there is not yet a government commitment to funding screening nor
intensive support, and continued work is needed.
Interviews with UNICEF teams and with model stakeholders highlight that UNICEF has
been very active in advocating for models and their funding in general. However, there
was no discussion of financial and political advocacy being linked with key points in the
budgetary calendar (see chapter 2) when interventions are likely to be more effective in
influencing funding allocations.
A review of UNICEF’s planning documents by the evaluation team found no reference to
influencing government financial allocation for any of the models in Annual Work Plans,
Result Assessment Module monitoring plans or knowledge mobilisation and
communication plans, and very scant references to securing funding from other sources.
This was identified as an area for strengthening by UNICEF leadership.
“I think [access to funding] is where UNICEF, frankly speaking, has been the weakest.
Mobilising funds to do a pilot is okay … We’ve not been influencing that process
enough and I think as part of our new Country Programme … we’ve put a huge
emphasis on public finance. I think one key issue in the development of models is that
we’re not anticipating the cost of the model, how much will it take to scale it up? …
That’s a critical missing link, to be able to invest in or to influence the government
planning and budgeting.” UNICEF personnel
6.4.3. Influencing government through others
Although some stakeholders saw advocacy as largely or entirely the work of UNICEF,
others also wanted to see UNICEF leverage the ability of other organisations (including
stakeholders’ own) to advocate directly to government. Some interviewees said their
potential influence had not been fully employed in UNICEF’s leadership of modelling. They
suggested that UNICEF should leverage, and help to build, the capability of other
organisations such as national bodies, professional associations, civil society and local
leaders, and to connect government with others who could speak powerfully for models.
Ensuring that government could hear directly from groups and individuals who can speak
for the change brought about by a model was seen as a powerful change agent, and one
that could be used, for example, in promoting ECI.
82 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
“[Ministers] need to be more involved to see how it functions and what are the benefits
for the children, for the parents …. This is crucial for them to see what were the
systemic solutions … for the three ministries to take part and to really talk to the
people from the [Portuguese] government about how they made it, what they did,
when it was done …” System stakeholder
UNICEF teams and leaders, and stakeholders, also noted the importance of leveraging
other influences on government such as the EU (particularly the integration agenda), and
other key players such as Russia and China. The private sector was also seen as an
increasingly important influence on government. It was noted that UNICEF needed to take
the private sector into account when considering private-public partnerships and in
influencing work. This was seen as requiring the alignment of models with improving social
mobility, economic growth and labour market skills, as well as improving outcomes for the
most disadvantaged children. Finally, other funders including international financial
institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, European Investment Bank and
significant foundations were seen as important influences, although the need for funding
to be sustained across the lifetime of modelling and scale-up efforts and/or budgeted for
accordingly was emphasised.
6.4.4. Building movements and leveraging social commitment
As well as advocacy directed at government, there was strong support from some
stakeholders for UNICEF to do more to ‘change hearts and minds’ and to build and
mobilise social and professional movements in support of change. This issue was not
discussed by all stakeholders, but for some, practitioner associations, parent movements,
associations of guardians and other groups were seen as important for developing a
groundswell of support for an initiative. Examples were noted of this being effective in the
Serbian context, such as in relation to domestic violence or other crime. These potentially
powerful movements were seen as having potential to generate significant community and
social demand for change and can influence the status quo, plans and priorities of
government, and connect with the vision underlying models. The importance of UNICEF
recognising parents’ voices, and using their power to mobilise other support, was
particularly emphasised.
“The parents [in Georgia] made miracles! Getting our parents and our association with
them to see what they do, to exchange what they did, what steps were made, how
they did that, would be very powerful.” System stakeholder
The potential of networks and movements to be a direct influence on government was
seen as important, and UNICEF was viewed as having a role in connecting movements with
government. However, stakeholders also wanted UNICEF to build the momentum and
voice of these movements to become powerful coalitions, ready to act when the
government becomes receptive. Similarly, building the capacity of local leadership for
coalitions and as support for UNICEF’s ambition was also considered important.
Overall, stakeholders suggest a need for UNICEF to amplify and also diversify its advocacy
and communication activities. Several stakeholders saw a need for a national media
campaign, for example on foster care, parenting support or restorative justice, to support
the vision and ambition behind models. They valued conferences and seminars run by
UNICEF and welcomed more. They also emphasised the need to recognise that local
organisations often have strong networks that can be mobilized to build movements and
strengthen voices.
83 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
“Well, what I have witnessed in recent years is that UNICEF is really very successful in
connecting departments, connecting people, and motivating them […] everything that
UNICEF does and what it initiates, and that is in fact a fantastic starting point, to
propose something that is then either an extension, or something that is new. [UNICEF]
are a great starting point to win over people from other sectors” Local implementation
stakeholder
“[UNICEF need] to be present in the media; they have many resources to make it visible
and to advocate intensively with the policy makers and with the broader public about
things like this. I think it is strength of the UNICEF that everybody recognised what
UNICEF says. It's stuck within people's heads, it's important” Local implementation
stakeholder
The UNICEF teams recognised the central importance of government advocacy, and some
also talked about the importance of building social movements, but this and the need to
advocate with and through others were not as emphasised by the UNICEF teams as they
were by some stakeholders.
6.4.5. Integrating modelling, advocacy and communications
UNICEF personnel also commented that modelling, advocacy and communications work
need to be better integrated in modelling plans and work. They noted that UNICEF’s
internal structures separate advocacy, communications and programming expertise, and
also separate thematic areas, mirroring siloes in government. Some staff said that better
integration was achieved where projects had funded specific advocacy or communication
capacity attached to a model or programme of work.
“We need to bring the team to work together in an integrated way and deliver to
counterparts in an integrated way …. Wherever we have been successful it’s when
those four elements – communication, advocacy, innovation and programme
substance – were aligned …. [In the current structure] We are actually also reflecting
the segmentation of the government.” UNICEF personnel
This lack of integration is reflected in model planning and governance documents
reviewed. The 2020 communications and knowledge dissemination plans reviewed by the
evaluation team reflect these shortcomings. There are specific knowledge dissemination
plans for child protection, early childhood development and education, and a
communication strategy and integrated communication implementation plan. These do
not set out an overall vision or ambition for change (beyond a brief phrase or sentence),
nor analysis of the barriers to be addressed and shifts needed. A varied set of intended
activity is described but it is not clear how the activities contribute to the social and system
changes needed, and the connection with modelling and models is often unclear.
Similarly, there is a little reference to advocacy or communication activity in model- or
programme-level theories of change (the ECI model was an exception). Annual work plans
which formulate activity agreed with each Ministry varied in whether systems-level change
was described, but where it is mentioned it is with very limited detail, and the focus is on
describing modelling activity to be carried out. The UNICEF 2020 Results Assessment
Module monitoring plans similar briefly refer to the systems change ambition but largely
describe specific modelling work with few references to advocacy or communication.
There were no references in planning documents to financial advocacy specifically, and no
indications of advocacy being linked to specific points in the fiscal calendar.

la • All the exemplar models have good potential, and all need a combination of systems-
c
S level change, attention to delivery organisations and further development of the
model to realise that potential
• The FOW appears to be viable for scale-up, if the new Child and Family Centres are
established with FOW as part of their work. Further testing and optimisation of FOW
in this new setting would be needed
• IFC could be scaled-up provided the necessary changes to foster care regulations are
made; again further modelling under these new scenarios is needed.
• DMs are enacted in law but are unlikely to reach children and young people at scale
until there is an expansion in available rehabilitative activities. This, and continued
work towards wider support for restorative justice approaches, would be the most
useful focus for UNICEF’s continued work
85 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
• The ECI model is at an early stage of implementation and evaluation. The evidence
from this evaluation suggests it needs to be adjusted to adapt to the current capacity
of the system. A phased, iterative approach is likely to be needed to scale-up, to avoid
scaling-up before the model, and the wider system, are ready
• There would be value in further work to ensure the DOP model is adaptable to fit to
differing school capacities, with continued capacity building depending on need.
Overall, this is likely to improve the quality of the model’s implementation at scale
• The evidence for the relevance, efficiency and sustainability is mixed, and there is
scope to strengthen modelling in a number of ways:
• There needs to be clarity about the overall systems level change intended and
how the model is intended to contribute, and modelling needs to be located
within a wider portfolio of planned activities to which key stakeholders are
committed.
• UNICEF invests considerable resources in evaluation but there is scope to
strengthen implementation evaluation, effectiveness evaluation and cost-
effectiveness analysis.
• The design of models needs to be closer to the capabilities of the current system,
with more robust testing of implementation and fit, and iterative cycles of work
to improve the performance of the service system incrementally
• There needs to be more focus on gender in refining model content and
approaches and in evaluation.
• UNICEF needs to extend and diversify advocacy and communications work, and
strengthen and target financial advocacy, and integrate this with modelling.
• Planning and governance needs to be adapted to reflect these wider portfolios of
work, recognising that scaling up requires dynamic, non-linear approaches.
7.1. Readiness for scale-up of the exemplar models
In this section we assess the readiness for scale-up of the exemplar models and highlight
the key steps required. The discussion draws on the analysis in previous chapters and uses
the three ‘domains’ set out in the Dynamic Sustainability Framework, namely the wider or
outer system, the ‘inner system’ of delivery organisations, and the model itself. The
analysis distinguishes between work needed at each of these levels, for each model. The
table at the end of each section summarises the work needed and suggests a sequence.
The section on each model also includes a figure (Figures 7.1-7.5) which graphically
represent readiness for scale-up for each of the models, assessed against the UNICEF
Scale-up Framework. The figures reflect the four key domains of the UNICEF Scale-up
Framework, assessing how far the model has been optimised, how far the necessary
evidence has been generated, how far the model is fit for context, and how far
commitment has been secured. The domain of ‘fit for context’ was divided into two sub-
categories to show separate scores for the credibility, relevance and relative advantage of
the model, and its appropriateness, feasibility and acceptability, since these two sub-
categories were distinguished in interviewees’ assessments.
86 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
To create the figures, each of the five areas of assessment (i.e. the four domains in the
UNICEF Scale-Up Framework, one of which was divided into two) includes between 3-7
individual items (as set out in the USF). For each of individual item, a score from 0-3 was
assigned, based on the findings reported in chapters 3-6, with 0 representing little or no
progress and 3 representing work being complete. This was inputted into an excel
spreadsheet and a combined average score for each of the five areas was generated.
7.1.1 Family Outreach Worker
Current status
Many of the necessary model elements of FOW are in place, the text of proposed
legislation has been agreed in principle, and there is consensus about the Child and Family
Centres as the delivery organisations. The FOW model has strong potential to address
equity issues. The focus was widened from children at risk of family separation to children
with developmental disabilities, and stakeholders see it as able to reach children with
multiple needs. Data on the reach of the model across gender and family circumstances
would be needed to establish its ability to reach the most disadvantaged, and this will
depend in part on the strength of referral pathway. Given that there are still more boys in
out of home care than girls, the model has particular potential for boys, but its potential to
address other equity gaps is strong.
Wider system level work needed
Government’s commitment to legislating for and funding FOW as part of the work of Child
and Family Centres needs to be secured. This is likely to require continued and expanded
advocacy and communications, both directly to government and by building momentum
and support via other stakeholders. Stakeholders are also keen to see FOW as just part of a
wider spectrum of support services for families, so attention would need to be paid to
ensuring it does not divert funding from other levels of need or service intensity. Building
wider social demand for a spectrum of support for families, and particularly demand for
intensive services, would also help to create systems readiness for FOW.
Delivery organisations level work needed
As the new Centres are established, their capacity and ways of working will need to be
developed to support FOW alongside other functions, with review of how FOW fits with
other responsibilities and functions, training and support needs, and ensuring that the
service capacity required for FOW is made available.
Model level work needed
As Centres, once established, will be new environments for implementation of FOW (albeit
repurposed organisations that engaged in the modelling work), a phased approach to
implementation would be needed. Implementation may identify issues that require more
work to support Centres, and/or modification of the model. For example, the delivery
approach will need to be adapted to reach children in rural areas. The UNICEF vision is
locally based outreach workers with strong community links, employed and supported by
each Centre. This would need to be tested and evaluated and ongoing monitoring put in
place. Reviewing how FOW has operated in the new context will provide insight and
learning to strengthen the model and its wider delivery. Longer term outcomes should also
be evaluated once stable implementation has been achieved.

Assessment against the UNICEF Scale-up Framework
Figure 7.1 shows the evaluation team’s summative assessment of progress on FOW against
the domains in the UNICEF Scale-up Framework. The highest score is given for relevance,
credibility and having clear benefits. The score for ‘optimised programme’ reflects the
absence of some key components, including a model-level theory of change and clear core
and adaptable components and fidelity criteria. The score for ‘secured commitment’
reflects the fact that the agreed legislative changes have not been enacted, and the score
for ‘acceptable, appropriate, feasible and a good fit’ reflects the need to assess this in
relation to the new Child and Family Centres once established. The lowest score is for
‘evidence based’ reflecting that there is limited evidence about outcomes.

7.1.2. Intermittent Foster Care
Progress made
Many of the necessary model elements of IFC are in place, and proposed legislation has
been agreed in principle. Like FOW, IFC has strong potential to address equity issues
although more analysis of its reach across family types and cultural groups is needed. In
was used in the modelling period to support children with a range of disabilities, one- and
two-parent families, and children from a range of cultural backgrounds. In the modelling
stages the service was used by boys more than girls, and the reasons for this disparity
88 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
should be explored. The most marginalised families are likely to have least access to
potential intermittent foster carers in their existing circles which should be a continued
focus in implementation and evaluation, and the reach of Centres for Foster Care and
Adoption into rural areas also needs to be taken into account.
Wider system level work needed
Government’s commitment to legislating for and funding the service as part of the work of
Centres for Foster Care and Adoption needs to be secured. This is likely to require
continued and expanded advocacy and communications, both directly to government and
by building momentum and support via other stakeholders. Stakeholders are also keen to
see IFC as just part of a wider spectrum of support services for families, so attention would
need to be paid to ensuring it does not divert funding from other levels of need or service
intensity, and that support for families at other levels of need is also strengthened. As
with FOW, building social demand for services for vulnerable families, as well as promoting
IFC among potential foster carers, would be helpful.
Longer term, there would be value in considering whether the foster care system is the
most appropriate delivery system for IFC. Situating the model in the foster care system
may be optimal at this point, given that foster care is a priority recognised by government.
However, there are questions about whether it is the best long-term service delivery
platform for IFC, and if not, what is, and how to secure it as a sustainable base.
Delivery organisations level work needed
As with FOW, implementation of IFC by Centres for Foster Care and Adoption using the
new regulations should be tested to ensure they reduce friction between IFC and the
foster care system sufficiently. The capacity of Centres for Social Work to support IFC
under the new regulations should also be assessed.
Model level activity needed
Guidance and procedures will need to be adapted to the new regulations, and any
necessary adaptations made to ensure IFC reaches the most marginalised children
including those in rural areas and where families do not have known potential foster
carers. Monitoring needs to be in place and longer-term impacts on children’s outcomes
measured.

the domains in the UNICEF Scale-up Framework. Like FOW, the highest score is given for
relevance, credibility and having clear benefits. The score for ‘secured commitment’
reflects the fact that the agreed legislative changes have not been enacted. The score for
‘acceptable, appropriate, feasible and a good fit’ reflects concerns about delivery capacity
and about the acceptability of respite care to families. The score for ‘optimised
programme’ reflects the absence of model-level theory of change, set of core and
adaptable components and fidelity criteria, and a monitoring system. The lowest score is
for ‘evidence based’ reflecting that there is limited evidence about outcomes.

7.1.3. Diversionary Measures
Progress status
UNICEF’s work has increased the acceptability of DMs to key professional groups and
strengthened local intersectoral support for DMs, as well as developing standards. The
summative evaluation101 notes that data on the reach of DMs to the most vulnerable
groups was not available, but that those in the youth justice system are likely to be highly
vulnerable. Capacity building had addressed equity issues somewhat but a more
systematic focus on this in the next stages of work will be important. Overall DMs have the
potential to promote equity issues. Given the preponderance of boys in the youth justice
system, they are likely to benefit boys disproportionately, and additional attention should
be paid to the needs of girls within the system and conscious or unconscious bias in their
treatment which might be a barrier to the use of DMs.
Wider system level work needed
The key barriers to scale-up are the need to increase the funding, provision,
appropriateness and quality of DM activities. This needs to be addressed as matter of
some urgency, since DMs are only notionally of value and beneficial without appropriate
rehabilitative activities available. The availability of tailored, appropriate and high quality
rehabilitative activities for girls, and for children in rural and other service-deprived areas
will need to be addressed, and agreement for how this would be funded nationally
secured. Activity to build wider social acceptance of restorative practice, and better
understanding of the circumstances that can lead to juvenile crime, would help to build
social readiness and demand for DMs.
Delivery organisations level work needed
Support to promote local cooperation to establish the necessary range of rehabilitative
activities in each locality is likely to be important, but it is not yet clear that there is a
scalable model for providing such support. UNICEF is unlikely to have the capacity to
promote local cooperation nationwide. Further work to establish how cooperation can be
promoted, perhaps by local leaders, is needed.
Continued work is also needed to embed restorative practice more fully in professional
ways of working in the judicial professions. A single system for monitoring the use of DMs
and judicial system outcomes needs to be established. Finally, the capacity of Centres for
Social Work to carry out assessments and oversee DMs also needs to be secured.
Model level work needed
Stakeholders noted the need to improve and standardise the quality of assessment of the
appropriate DM for each young person, referrals and rehabilitative activities, and to clarify
responsibilities and guidance. Better evidence, including on how to optimise the use of
DMs and about impacts on recidivism and costs savings, is needed.

Assessment against the UNICEF Scale-up Framework
Figure 7.3 shows the evaluation team’s summative assessment of progress made against
the domains in the UNICEF Scale-up Framework. The highest score is given for relevance,
credibility and having clear benefits. The score for ‘secured commitment’ reflects the fact
that the model is secured in legislation but without clarity about where responsibility for
developing and funding rehabilitative activity sits. The score for ‘acceptable, appropriate,
feasible and a good fit’ reflects concerns about delivery capacity and about the public and
professional support for restorative justice. The score for ‘optimised programme’ reflects
the absence of model-level theory of change, set of core and adaptable components and
fidelity criteria, monitoring system and costs analysis. The lowest score is for ‘evidence
based’ reflecting that there is limited evidence about implementation, outcomes and cost-
effectiveness.

7.1.4. Early Childhood Intervention
Progress made
A great deal of enthusiasm and support for the model has been generated, and core model
components developed. There are concerns about the capacity of organisations to
accommodate the model alongside other work, and the optimal delivery platform for ECI is
not yet clear.
The model has strong potential to address equity issues. The likely impact by gender will
need to be a focus in data collection. The current system, where paediatricians undertake
initial assessment as part of universal provision, has good potential to reach children in
need widely. The new national register of children with disabilities may also be helpful.
Reach to deprived and rural areas will need to be taken into account in determining the
best delivery system.
Wider system level work required
There are different views among stakeholders as to the right delivery system for ECI. It will
be essential to resolve this and to secure consensus before investing in further modelling.
There are different views about early intervention should be integrated into the work of all
relevant professionals, or the responsibility of virtual cross-sectoral teams, or undertaken
by specialist multi-disciplinary teams. Alternative proposals are that it should be the work
of a new national centre focus on early childhood development, or of public health
nursing. There are also some preferences for local variation that could encompass all or
some of the above. There are concerns that assigning ECI exclusively to specialist teams
would not embed early intervention and prevention in mainstream services. Continued
work and consultation, and clarification of Ministerial leadership, is needed.
An evidence-informed case for early intervention and prevention will need to be made to
government and relevant professionals based on outcomes and costs data and, ultimately,
demonstrating a feasible model. As with other models, this is likely to require a wide range
of advocacy and communications activity, as well as linking with professional training
provision. There is also a need for public- and professional-facing communication to
promote the value of early intervention and to build parent and professional movements
supporting these approaches.
Delivery organisation level work required
The model as currently designed is challenging for the delivery organisations involved,
even under modelling conditions (where there is usually more tolerance of additional
demands). Continued work is needed to build delivery organisation capacity and systems
support for ECI
Model level work required
An important step towards scale-up will be to review and simplify the model, in line with
developing delivery organisation and system capacity, with further phases of modelling to
optimise it for whatever is the chosen delivery system. Robust evaluation will be needed
through phases of modelling, initially to test training and capacity building approaches and
implementation, and then to measure short- and longer-term outcomes. A phased and
iterative approach to modelling and scaling up seems particularly important: confidence
could easily be lost and resources and opportunity wasted through scaling-up before the
model and wider service system are ready, and this is recognised by UNICEF personnel.
“We have different professionals with different experiences with not so much
experiences in collaboration among them, from different sectors. This is a long-term
process, and even when we define the model, we will need some time to really put that
93 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
model in the system, and just provide the assisted mechanisms and good mechanisms
to keep that process in next few years, so we succeed maybe in ten years or five years.”

Figure 7.4 shows the evaluation team’s summative assessment of progress on ECI against
the domains in the UNICEF Scale-up Framework. The scores largely reflect the early stage
in modelling of this model, and particularly that evaluation is only just being put in place
and that key model components have not yet been optimised based on learning from
implementation. The score for ‘acceptable, appropriate, feasible and a good fit’ reflects
concerns about delivery capacity and that early intervention is not embedded in
professional expectations and training.

7.1.5. Dropout Prevention Programme
Progress made
UNICEF has made significant achievements with the DOP. It has raised the profile of school
dropout, demonstrated a viable approach for addressing dropout, had key elements of the
approach embedded in education systems, and shown how schools’ own data systems can
be used to support dropout prevention and monitoring of outcomes. The inclusion of
multiple risks to school attendance in DOP means that it is well positioned to address
equity issues, and it will have a particular role to play in addressing the gender-specific
reasons for girls to drop out of school. Data on the reach and effectiveness of dropout
activity across gender and different demographic and cultural groups is needed. Different
cultural attitudes to education, and the possible unintended consequences for families
who are dependent on a child’s economic contribution, will need to be taken into account.
Systems level work needed
UNICEF is positioning DOP within a wider framing of school inclusion and school
improvement, and advances where would help to secure systems-level support for DOP
and to make the case for greater government investment in school training capacity
building to support DOP. This framing would also be helpful in widening perceptions of the
role of teachers and schools, which is likely to need school- and parent-facing
communication. There is also a need to continue national level advocacy to sustain funding
and support for drop-out prevention and monitoring of drop out, and to continue to
expand the economic and social welfare provision required to support DOP work
expectations and priorities.
Delivery organisation level work needed
UNICEF should continue to promote the programme, despite it already being embedded in
wider school policies and development plans. Means to achieve this include providing
training and capacity building support to support schools to use DOP well where this is
needed, including the risk assessment tool, to build networks of community support, and
to develop individual education plans that effectively address students’ needs. As UNICEF
is unlikely to be able to support implementation nationwide, strategies for building school
and local capacity should, over time, be handed over to the education sector to deliver.
DOP should be linked with school strategies and priorities, to promote it within a wider
vision of school inclusion and school improvement.
Model level work needed
Given the view of some stakeholders that the DOP model is too complex for some schools,
in particular the use of the EWIS tool, further review is needed to identify where the model
might be simplified, or support extended, to reduce the burden on schools. Continued
evidence building is needed to monitor implementation of DOP and measure its impact,
including on longer term education, employment and welfare outcomes.

Assessment against the UNICEF Scale-up Framework
Figure 7.5 shows the evaluation team’s summative assessment of progress on DOP against
the domains in the UNICEF Scale-up Framework. Overall the model scores relatively high,
reflecting that almost all the necessary model components are in place, the model is well
received by schools, it is implementable although there is some evidence that it is seen as
onerous and not necessarily in line with school priorities, commitment was secured to roll-
out also not to supporting implementation at scale as fully as UNICEF want to see, and
there is good evidence on both outcomes (at least short term) and implementation.

7.2. Modelling as assessed against the OECD/DAC
criteria
The evaluation questions focused on three OECD/DAC criteria, namely relevance
(evaluation question relating to decisions about where to invest in modelling) efficiency
(evaluation questions relating to the conduct of modelling) and sustainability (evaluation
questions relating to whether modelling is achieving sustained change through scale-up.
This section reviews the evaluation findings in relation to each OECD/DAC criterion.
7.3.1 Relevance
There is mixed evidence about whether modelling, as illustrated by the five exemplar
models, responds to beneficiary, global, country and partner/institution needs, policies
and priorities. This relates to the evaluation question about how UNICEF chooses and
initiates investments in modelling.
UNICEF undertakes systematic analysis in initiating investments in modelling and involves
key stakeholders effectively from early on in modelling. The decision to embark on
modelling is explicitly agreed with government and documented in annual work plans,
although the wider systems change ambitions and work involved is much less the subject
of explicit agreement.
The five exemplar models were all seen by stakeholders as relevant to beneficiaries’ needs,
reflecting gaps in current provision, and in line with the priorities of most of the key
partners involved in modelling. There was more mixed evidence about their relevance to
national policies and priorities. All five models were included in annual work plans agreed
with lead Ministries, and considerable efforts were made to have government
representatives at the centre of modelling work. However, the data suggest that they were
not always sufficiently strongly aligned with national government priorities, and that policy
analysis as an initial stage of modelling needs to be strengthened. This also reflects that
fact that modelling is used to stimulate recognition of aspects of need and to create
agreement around new priorities as well as to meet identified priorities. Models will
always, to some extent, be ahead of government recognition of an aspect of child rights.
Extended advocacy and communication work is needed to ensure stronger alignment.
7.3.2 Efficiency
Efficiency is concerns with the extent to which modelling delivers, or is likely to deliver,
results in an economic and timely way, as compared with other feasible alternatives. It is
reflected in evaluation questions concerning the alignment of UNICEF’s modelling activity
with emerging international consensus about what is required for scale-up, and whether
modelling is an efficient way of achieving the intended ambitions of the country
programme.
The findings indicate that UNICEF’s approach to modelling is broadly in line with what is
emerging as international consensus (as expressed in the UNICEF Scale-up Framework).
There is extensive and focused work in each of the four domains. There is clearly intensive
activity to create the necessary model components, although some gaps in initial
resources or refined versions following early modelling. There is a significant investment in
generating evidence, although a need to increase the rigour and robustness of
implementation, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness evidence in line with international
standards. The models are not fully fit for context and all face some challenges in scale-up
as a result, and this is an area where further work is needed. Commitment was secured to
scaling-up DOP following modelling, but legislative and regulatory change to scale-up FOW
97 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
and IFC has not been enacted, and commitment to scaling-up the use of DMs is limited.
There are a number of areas where the evaluation findings suggest that modelling needs
to be strengthened for greater efficiency in modelling (discussed in the next section).
No clear alternative strategy to modelling emerged in the evaluation, but there were
recurrent messages about the need for additional and complementary activity, and for the
need for modelling to be more clearly integrated in a wider portfolio of work.
7.3.3 Sustainability
Sustainability is concerned with the extent to which the benefits of modelling continue, or
are likely to continue. It is reflected in evaluation questions concerning intended pathways,
outcomes or impediments to scale-up, and the feasibility of the models for scale-up.
Overall, here the evidence is mixed. There was a clear pathway for scale-up for each of the
exemplar models, although the activity needed to create the wider systems condition and
support for scale up was not always clear. Only DOP has yet been scaled-up up. FOW is in
principle scalable if the new Child and Family Centres are established with FOW embedded
within their work and funded from central budgets. IFC is scalable if changes to foster care
regulations are made. There are more significant challenges to the scale-up of DMs given
the lack of capacity in rehabilitative activities and weak assessment and monitoring
systems. It is too early to assess the scalability of ECI although there are challenges to the
current implementation model. In summary, the evidence for modelling having thus far
resulted in scaled-up models is not strong. This reflects the fact the models are ambitious
in the systems improvement they are intended to stimulate and improvements to child
rights that they would involve.
7.3. Strengthening modelling
“[Diversionary measures] is a project. All the projects that we have are temporary.”
System stakeholder
Modelling is powerfully demonstrating what could be achieved by an improved and
reformed service system. However, none of the models in the evaluation have as yet been
fully scaled-up. There is a degree of weariness among some of UNICEF’s stakeholders that
modelling that does not lead to further change, and a recognition that more is needed to
improve the wider service system and to support models at scale.
“We can make another programme, but if we are not able to make it sustainable, then
why would we need to invest in that? Why should we invest in that, just to try it?”
System stakeholder
“[UNICEF] can always provide more training and provide more awareness raising et
cetera et cetera but if you still do not have a functional system, speaking about best
practices and how something is good is not actually changing the system.” System
stakeholder
The findings highlight scope to strengthen modelling in a number of areas, discussed
below.
98 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
7.3.1. Situating modelling within systems change ambitions and a
wider portfolio of work
Each of the models relates to wider systems change ambitions. There is scope for these
ambitions to be more clearly set out and for an integrated portfolio of work to be planned
and taken forward, encompassing modelling, political and financial advocacy, and
communications activity. This work is needed to create readiness for scale-up of the
models.
The data suggest that the service, and wider system, in Serbia are not yet fully ready for
the exemplar models. The models are clearly valued and positively viewed, and seen as
necessary and effective improvements to what is currently available. They have significant
potential to improve services for vulnerable children and advance child rights. They
demonstrate what an improved system would look like, what it could achieve, and what it
would take to secure those improvements. Ultimately, ‘bad systems trump good
programmes’; work is needed to strengthen systems to support scale-up, and it is unlikely
that models can be scaled-up without wider systems strengthening.
For this potential to be realised, there needs to be continued, bi-directional, work. This
would involve on the one hand adapting and simplifying the models, reducing onus and
complexity as far as is possible without undermine the core principles of the model. At the
same time, there is a need to continue to strengthen the wider system to be more
supportive of the models and more ready for them. This work is needed before the models
are scaled-up, because there is otherwise a significant risk that scale-up will not succeed:
the models would not be used, or not used fully and well, so that the outcomes found
during modelling are not replicated.
Scaling up models and securing UNICEF’s wider ambitions requires a portfolio of work that
reflects the wider system changes required to support the model at scale, based on
systematic review of the barriers and enablers to change, with strategies chosen
specifically to address them. It is likely to require multiple inter-linked activities across
modelling, capacity building, communication, advocacy and research. Box 7.1 highlights
key principles involved in successful transformation of service systems, and UNICEF should
consider how far these are currently leveraged and the scope to extend this.
UNICEF needs to be clear about the overall goal and vision for change, how the model is
intended to contribute to this, and what it therefore needs to demonstrate, achieve or
change. UNICEF needs to have, share and be able to articulate a compelling vision for
change. This ambition needs to be, or quickly become, the ambition owned by
government, and by other stakeholders such as professional groups who can advocate for
it, and not viewed only as an ambition owned by UNICEF with long term dependency on
UNICEF to take forward innovation.
A degree of agility is needed, recognising that UNICEF’s ambition may not yet be shared by
some stakeholders. For example, the UNICEF team made the decision to emphasise school
attendance and attainment initially to align DOP with government priorities, and to enable
a targeted approach to Roma children, and only subsequently situated DOP within the
wider ambition of inclusion. What is important is that UNICEF itself is clear about the wider
ambition and how the model contributes to this ambition, captures this in planning and
governance documents (see below), and secures commitment from stakeholders to a
shared vision and pathway for scale-up. If this is not in place there is a risk that formulaic
commitment to modelling is achieved but without the intention to provide the full support
required for socially significant change.
99 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
Box 7.1 Approaches to systems change
→ Approaches to systems change
Implementation science and complex systems thinking highlight six
principles102 103 104that are commonly acknowledged as promoting
successful transformation of service systems:
• Provide and enable leadership: this involves providing a
compelling vision and narrative for change, nurturing informal as
well as formal leaders, allowing for local priority setting,
developing shared goals, ensuring the necessary resources are
available, being knowledgeable, and persevering
• Enable improvement cultures: since change is a constant feature
of systems, mechanistic implementation of innovations can
become outdated. A continuous quality improvement culture is
one that uses feedback loops and data in decision-making, and
that involves iterative development and testing, and ongoing
adjustment of strategies and structures
• Promote continuous, collaborative learning: successful change
relies on multiple strategies for continuous and shared learning
• Understand and attend to context: the changes needed will vary
between local contexts depending on existing resource,
structures, relationships and so on. Successful systems change
takes this into account.
• Maintain open and purposeful two-way communication: This is
important for creating and sustaining a shared understanding of
goals and challenges. It involves mapping stakeholder groups,
considering how to make communication personally engaging,
and working with existing communication structures
• Engaging families and the public: key to the quality and
acceptability of services and to empowerment and equity.
Engagement should be oriented not only to consultation but to
participation and collaboration.
7.3.2. Improving model evaluation
UNICEF makes a considerable investment in evaluation as part of modelling. However,
more rigorous approaches are needed to fully test models, assess whether and where they
need to be strengthened to improve impact, determine whether they are ready for scale-
up and judge whether the investment in scale-up can be justified. More robust evidence
about implementation would help to strengthen the fit of models within the existing
system. Evidence based on experimental or quasi-experimental designs, validated

100 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
measures, and longer-term follow up of outcomes for children and families would help to
strengthen the case for scale-up.
UNICEF and its partners are understandably ambitious about scaling up delivery once early
evaluation has highlighted that a model has advantages over services as usual. However, it
is not unusual for a service to be well regarded but of limited effectiveness. Strengthening
evaluation evidence would mean that models could be improved over time to maximise
their effectiveness, and would avoid scaling-up a model that is weak, or even harmful for
some groups.
Evaluation activity needs to be phased, with research questions that are appropriate to the
stage of model development and implementation. Stronger early evaluation would also
help to identify where a mode needs to be re-thought, or where it chances of success are
slim.
At the same time, it may not be desirable to delay wider delivery, if early evaluation is
positive and current service provision is clearly inadequate, while long term evaluation is
initiated. The following strategies are recommended to balance the absence of robust
evidence:
• Taking a phased approach to scale-up with a more robust evaluation of a second,
larger, stage of modelling, with the aim of moving quickly to wider scale-up
• Longer-term follow-up of children and families involved in initial modelling and
evaluation, so that decisions are taken on the basis of initial evaluation but
continued monitoring yield longer term outcomes. Scaled-up delivery might need
to be adapted, or even down-scaled for a period of model improvement, if
findings from longer term evaluation are not favourable
• Building iterative cycles of evaluation and improvement into delivery as it is
scaled-up, so that the model is continuously improved as it is scaled-up
• Using a model-level theory of change to assess, through early shorter-term
evaluation, whether the conditions identified as critical to success are in place
and whether early outcomes indicate that a model is on track to achieve longer-
term outcomes
• Drawing on existing international evidence to highlight the proven effectiveness
of principles that are inherent in a model (e.g. early intervention, intensive family
support or restorative justice) and that have been effective in multiple
evaluations of similar programmes in similar settings.
7.3.3. Adapting and optimising the models
UNICEF has designed models to be delivered by existing organisations and systems, which
is an important aspect of scalability. However, there is a need to adapt models to be closer
to the capabilities and functions of the current system. This is so that what is modelled is a
way of working that is scalable within the current system, capable of stimulating
incremental improvement, and with further activity planned to narrow the gap iteratively.
A model that stretches the current system, but that does not exceed capacities, is more
likely to be scalable than one that is too ambitious and that can only be implemented with
significant continued support from UNICEF or others. An over-ambitious model would
mean that the system remains dependent on UNICEF to drive forward innovation. Again,
this is an issue that should be addressed if UNICEF is to do more than demonstrate what
could, under artificial conditions, be achieved.
101 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
“Sometimes best is the enemy of good. And especially when it comes to a model. And I
think that’s a lesson to learn …. If I go back to the school dropout model, fantastic
results. The level of support that went into it made it unreplaceable … we invested so
much resource, time, to really look at every single aspect, that the programme was not
replicable per se, because too much investment went into it, and I think we had this
from the evaluation. I think people from schools were saying ‘We’re expecting to
replicate it because we do want to support children at risk of dropping out, yet we
can’t. This model is too complicated.’ …. Sometimes good is good enough if you really
want to make an impact and a difference to the life of children.” UNICEF personnel
This is illustrated in Figure 7.6. The lower line represents the current quality of system
performance (i.e. how far the current system produces optimum outcomes) and the upper
dotted line represented desired performance. These are not positioned based on an actual
assessment of performance: they are an exaggerated image of the need to improve the
system. The cycles of activity represent iterative integrated projects of work, each
designed to start at the current level of system performance, and to make incremental
improvements. Presenting them separately is a simplification – in reality there should be
strong links between each cycle of activity and continuous elements. Improvement in the
system is represented by the wavy line – the shape illustrating that progress is not linear.
As the green (upper and to the left) and blue (lower and to the right) arrows show, over
time, the performance of the system improves, and the gap narrows, until the optimal
level of performance is reached.
Figure 7.6 Iterative system improvement
Improved monitoring and evaluation would be an important aid to decision-making in this
iterative approach. The approach also implies that UNICEF should plan for a gradual
process of transferring ownership or leadership of a model, rather than a single (and
especially early) transfer, so that the team can continue to adapt the model, and build the
readiness of delivery organisations and the wider system to support it. The DOP model
provides a good example here, where too early a transfer of a model that was still
somewhat beyond the capabilities of some schools, before the necessary infrastructure of
community services was in place, led to inconsistent implementation. UNICEF should plan
to provide this continued stewardship until transfer can be completed.
102 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
Modelling needs to robustly test whether the model is implementable and whether it has
the potential to stimulate the intended element of system change. This requires more
robust exploration of implementation barriers and enablers and the quality of fit with
service settings and the wider system, supported by improved monitoring and evaluation.
It also requires fidelity to be balanced with the need for adaptation – see Box 7.2.
Box 7.2 Balancing fidelity with adaptation
Recent writing on effective implementation105 106 107 as well as classic
papers108 highlight the importance of balancing fidelity in implementation
with recognition of the importance of adaptation to ensure fit to local
contexts. Fidelity means the extent to which an intervention is
implemented as intended.
Weaknesses in adhering to the programme model (frequently referred to
as ‘programme drift’) is a frequent reason why intended results of
interventions are not achieved. But at the same time, the adaptability of
an innovation is frequently identified as a key criterion for transferability
and scalability.
As the importance of fit to context is increasingly recognised, deliberate
changes to interventions based on considerations of fit with service
settings and the wider system are recognised as necessary: ‘Thus,
adaptations to EBPs [evidence based programmes] have gone from
nuisances to be eliminated to important tools to be harnessed in the
pursuit of effective healthcare.’ Miller et al. (2019):1164. In fact, rather
than fidelity and adaptation being dichotomous, they co-exist as key
aspects of implementation. Hence, there is a need to draw on
stakeholders’ knowledge of the innovation and the context. Remaining
true to the meaning and role of core programme functions may be
necessary, rather than direct replication.
For UNICEF this suggests a need for a more flexible approach to adapting a
model where it does not fit well with the service or wider system context.
It also highlights the need for continued research to identify the core
functions in a programme and the range of acceptable adaptation.
7.3.4. Sharpening the focus on gender
There is considerable scope to improve the focus on gender in modelling, both in the
development of nuanced gender-sensitive programme content and practices, and in

foregrounding gender in monitoring systems, evaluation of reach, quality of

answered and more work is needed to address them.

their skills?
• Is model equally effective for boys and girls, mothers and fathers?
DM • Are there gender specific patterns of behavioural problems that lead to
contact with the criminal justice systems?

type? Are there specific measures issued for girls and boys? Why? Do
professionals have some gender stereotypes when issuing measures?
• Are there differences in the effectiveness of DMs for boys and girls?
ECI • Are there any differences in patterns of support-seeking in regard to girls
and boys with disabilities? Are parents of girls with disabilities more prone to
hide disability, to ask for support later? Or vice versa?
• Do outreach and screening recognise some gender-specific patterns among
parents of girls and boys with disabilities? Are outreach professionals aware
of some of these differences and how do they address them?
• Are there gendered differences in the content of intensive support
provided to girls and boys, and to mothers and fathers?
• Are there differences in the effectiveness of ECI for boys and girls?
DOP • What is the prevalence of girls and boys identified as at risk?
• Is the risk assessment system gender sensitive? Does it take into account
risks of early marriages among Roma girls and girls from the poorest
families109? Is it sensitive to dropout of boys in rural areas due to the early
engagement in work on family farms. Or any other gender specific risks.
• Are there cultural differences in family responses? Is boys’ education
viewed as more important?
• Are there gender biases in the school response when risk is identified and
the support documented in IEPs and put in place? Are girls viewed as needing
less support?
• Are there differences in the effectiveness of DOP for boys and girls?
109 Some of these issues are being addressed in the further modelling of DOP within the Child Marriage
programme

7.3.5. Influencing the allocation of funds
Influencing funding allocations will be challenging given fiscal restraint and low levels of
transparency. However, the clear budgetary calendar offers opportunities for timely and
targeted financial advocacy. Much of such work will be closely entwined with political
advocacy and securing political commitment to scale-up will often bring with it financial
commitment. However, there is scope for UNICEF to strengthen its financial advocacy with
better cost analysis, making the case on the basis of efficiencies, and addressing the
challenge of funding the transition from current to new services.
UNICEF needs to make consistent representations at multiple levels of MoLEVSA and other
relevant ministries, targeted at multiple levels including Ministers, Ministerial Assistants,
State Secretaries, advisers and other government agencies. The aim should be to influence
the budgetary decision-making process from January to August in each year, with a view to
financial commitment to modelling and scale-up being included in the final budget and in
the government-wide annual work plan. In additional, the annual work plan that UNICEF
enters into with each ministry should be used to secure government funding
commitments, as well as demonstrating commitments made by UNICEF.
Annex 5 sets out the funding requirements for each of the models, and Annex 6 sets out
considerations for costing them.
Overall, given the level of centralisation in Serbia in the health, education and social
protection system, the best avenue for sustained funding is central government level and
respective ministries. Key issues that need to be addressed to government are, first, the
increase in the number of employees needed. This is determined by a special government
commission, which in recent years has approved employment in some areas of the public
sector, but not the social protection system. Second, the increase of funds for social
protection services needs to be addressed, particularly in earmarked transfers intended for
local government. The Ministry of Finance is central during the preparation of the fiscal
strategy, but individual ministries should be the key focus. MLEVSA is the most important
entry point for local social services, but the ministry is not in a position to request
additional funds without public pressure since government’s financial policy is not in
favour of social protection. The Ministry also does not have the capacity to reallocate
funds, and work is needed to improve their budgetary and other planning processes.
Alongside this, the Ministry of Demography and Family Care will also be important, as with
the Ministry of Education (in relation to DOP) and the Ministry of Health (relevant for ECI).
Social services are the area where local government are allowed to experiment more but
despite all the effort in the last two decades to increase the awareness of municipalities
regarding their importance, services are still undeveloped and with unequal access
throughout the country. The proposal of the draft Strategy of Social Protection
Development for 2019-2025 to determine a minimum level of expenditures for social
protection at the local level may also be a helpful target area. Another area for advocacy
could be the amendments to the Law on public private partnerships in order to allow
partnering with public institutions from the health, education and social work sector.
For FOW, funding would be required for further capacity building and testing of
implementation, and for posts in the new Child and Family Centres. Given that detailed
costing for this model has been performed, UNICEF should continue to present this and
the budget needed to the Ministry of Labor, Employment, Veteran and Social Affairs so
that they can consider options for public funding.
105 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
For IFC, the approach should continue to be to use financial resources within the current
foster care budget. For this model, funding will be also required for capacity building and
initial support, as well as for research on longer term outcomes for children and families and
communication and advocacy campaigns.
For DMs, significant funding is needed to expand the range of rehabilitative activities
available. The project that led to their implementation showed that there are two main
options for securing continuous financing of diversion measures.110 First, the project
proposed to create a special-purpose transfers under the Law on Social Protection and the
Law on Financing of Local Self-Government. Another possibility considered is that the
Government secure financing by establishing a special budgetary fund that could be
financed through the “institute of opportunity”, a mechanism which grants prosecutors
discretion not to prosecute non-opportune cases in exchange for a fee being paid and/or
to confiscate and manage the proceeds of crime. In discussions with the Ministry of Justice
this proposal was not endorsed as these funds are currently used for a whole range of
public interest priorities (education, health etc). The Law on Juvenile Offenders and
Criminal Justice Protection of Minors envisages DMs, however it is not clearly defined who
should be responsible for those payments as well as who disburses payments for different
types of measures.
The document costing DOP111 argues that “implementation of the developed dropout
prevention and intervention model is based on existing school teams and resources, thus
there is no need for additional employment of teachers, professional associates or any
other school staff”. The document develops a budget needed to cover costs of trainings to
be delivered to school teachers to be involved in all the matters related to dropout
prevention and intervention. However, there is no discussion about the cooperation
between teachers and social workers which is an important part of this process especially
for more problematic cases where inclusion of parents is important for success of dropout
prevention activities. The Strategy of Social Protection Development for 2019-2025
recommends that local self-governments with higher share of students at high risk of
dropout and children living in Roma settlements allocate larger number of workers from
Centres for Social Work to support DOP, and advises to secure central budget funds for
these purposes.
ECI is at an early stage in modelling, but information about costs and potential areas for
savings should be included in the implementation evaluation. The model is predicated on
the assumption that, as it targets children with disabilities and development delay, costs
will largely be borne from central funds. For this model, UNICEF could consider initially
making a special fund where along with their funds resources from private donors could be
pooled and matched with the public funds both at the national and local level. Local self-
governments that have larger budgets like the capital Belgrade or other major cities, like
Novi Sad, Subotica, Kragujevac, Kraljevo should also be approached.
7.3.6. Extending advocacy and communications
As noted in Chapter 5, UNICEF’s stakeholders consistently see a need for UNICEF to be
more active in advocacy and communication and to diversify its approaches. Some of the
exemplar models are viewed as not, or no longer, aligned with government priorities. This
suggests a need for more nuanced and systematic analysis of political contexts to identify
synergies, potential blockages and potential influencers, and for development of ‘softer’
influencing skills and strategies within UNICEF. This is likely to need a wider range of
110 Strengthening the justice and social welfare systems to advance the protection of children in Serbia. Final
report.
111 Combating Early School Leaving in Serbia (Be Cool Stay @ School)
106 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
approaches that aim to influence government both directly and indirectly, and from top-
down and bottom-up, through international institutions, national institutions, and
professional and social movements.
For UNICEF’s models that against a sectoral or social status quo, increased advocacy
efforts will be important to build collective and aligned commitment to change. This
requires not only the commitment of government and stakeholders but also the more
abstract consideration of ‘social commitment’: the support and backing of the families,
community and local leaders, key social and professional groups or movements, and the
wider public who will experience, work with or be affected by the model. This is especially
important if a model is particularly ambitious or challenging, or if it represents a significant
paradigm shift or change to existing norms. For example, DMs represent a very different
philosophical approach to juvenile justice for a system and society where there is strong
attachment to punitive rather than restorative approaches.
Extended advocacy efforts are therefore required to secure government commitment, but
so too is wider communication, advocacy, influencing and mobilising social movements in
support of change.
7.3.7. Planning and governance
Synchronised and aligned work is needed across different levels and elements of the
service system, with realistic timescales for phases of activity to avoid scaling-up a model
before the infrastructure is in place to support it. Progress is unlikely to be linear, and this
requires dynamic, adaptive and agile approach to planning and governance, with regular
review, analysis of successes and blockages, recalibration of planned activity, and revised
plans112. Because wider change is unpredictable, parallel planning for multiple scenarios is
likely to be needed.
The project design process needs to take more specific account right from the start of
what are likely to be barriers to implementation and scale-up, and projects need to be
planned with specific strategies to address these potential barriers. There needs to be
clarity about the ‘end game’, i.e. the intended delivery platform or mechanism for scaled-
up delivery i.e. the intended delivery platform or mechanism for scaled-up delivery
Theories of change need to be used more consistently, and with more focus on scale-up
challenges and pathways. This needs both a model-level theory of change which
demonstrates the change mechanisms and necessary conditions for achieving them, and a
theme- or programme-level theory of change which shows the model as part of a wider
systems change ambition, the particular contribution it makes, what other activity is
needed, and how the model is integrated with other elements. Theories of change need to
show all the activity required to achieve the ambition (whether model-level or
programme-level), including advocacy and communication work. This was part of the ECI
theory of change, for example, but was missing from others.
Evaluation plans needs to test implementation barriers and strategies and the viability of
the intended end-game, as well as building to robust information about outcomes and
costs.
112 The Monitoring Results for Equity Systems determinants framework may be a useful aid here
107 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
The formulation of budgets needs to improve and financial analysis used alongside ‘making
the case’ conceptually in targeted and timely financial advocacy to influence political
decision-making about funding allocation.
Communication and knowledge dissemination plans need to be explicitly linked to models
and scale-up intentions.
The annual work plans, which formulate the activity agreed by each Ministry, vary in
whether a clear vision for systems-level change is described. Even where modelling is set
within this context, the vision is described very briefly. Plans largely describe specific
modelling activity, with little or no reference to work required to build wider support.
Although there are some references to the need for cooperation by other ministries, cross-
sectoral capacity building is not emphasised. Overall they represent modelling in quite
narrow, transactional terms, and demonstrate government commitment to modelling but
not to scale-up or systems-level change. It may sometimes be tactical to take forward early
modelling work, supported by government, before this wider commitment is foregrounded
in annual work plans, but this does not provide a strong foundation and commitment to
larger ambitions should be secured and documented as soon as is possible. These plans
should also be used to secure government financial commitment, as well as demonstrating
the commitment made by UNICEF.
The narrow representation of modelling in plans is even more pronounced in the UNICEF
2020 Result Assessment Module monitoring plans. These briefly refer to a wider ambition,
and set out standard indicators (e.g. ‘existence of regulations for application of
diversionary schemes and alternative sanctions’) and output measures (e.g. ‘cross-sectorial
model for early childhood intervention (ECI) services developed for Serbia’). Much of the
work needed to strengthen the system to support the models is missing, and there are few
references to advocacy or communications. UNICEF’s modelling would be better
supported by an approach to planning that foregrounded systems change ambitions, set
out an integrated programme of activity in which the role of the model was clear, allowed
for non-linear progress (e.g. adaptation of models and further phases of modelling),
referenced the conditions necessary for effective modelling and scale-up and work to
secure them, and allowed for unexpected and unpredictable changes in those conditions.
Annex 13 also outlines areas where the SQN could better support scale-up.

C
Strong partnerships with stakeholders at national and local level were established. UNICEF
pursued modelling with considerable energy, commitment and expertise, and built
momentum, enthusiasm and support for the models. Many of the necessary components
of models were developed, and UNICEF invested in evaluation and monitoring.
The models were well regarded by local and national stakeholders, viewed as relevant and
credible, and seen as adding value to the service system. The Dropout Prevention
Programme has most successfully been scaled up, but other models have potential for
scale-up in the future with clear intended pathways for scale. Some stakeholders are
clearly committed to supporting scale-up.
109 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
Overall the Serbia UNICEF Country Office is widely viewed as a highly credible and expert
group, well positioned to develop and strengthen the models.
8.1.2. Weaknesses of modelling
Not all the necessary models of components had been developed and refined following
initial testing, with gaps including model-level theories of change, specification of core and
adaptable elements and fidelity criteria, monitoring systems, and assessment of costs.
Evaluation evidence generated was not always sufficiently robust, both in relation to
implementation analysis and measurement of outcomes. There is also scope to strengthen
the focus on gender in modelling, through the development of more nuanced gender-
sensitive programme content and practices, and through more emphasis on gender in
evaluation and monitoring. Modelling could be strengthened in these areas.
More significant is that, despite strengths in UNICEF’s approaches to modelling, three of
the four more advanced models have not yet been scaled up, and the full commitment of
all necessary stakeholders has not yet been secured. In particular, national government
commitments to legislative or regulatory change and to developing service capacity have
not been secured. These issues highlight a need for modelling to be better aligned with
(and also to shape) government priorities, to be more cognisant of the current limitations
of Serbian service systems, and to include work to strengthen systems to better support
the intended models.
8.1.3. Unintended consequences of modelling
There were no direct references, in the data collected, to modelling having unintended
consequences, and little basis to infer any such consequences. Challenges had been
encountered during the process of modelling and problems needed to be found, but this
was an expected part of the process. Modelling had generated or reinforced learning
about the models and the contexts of their implementation, again an expected part of the
process. The relationships formed between organisations and individuals during modelling,
and the skills and new insights acquired through modelling, had been of benefit to
stakeholders beyond the direct application to the specific model involved. Modelling had
also highlighted the weaknesses or shortcomings of parts of the service system, for
example the reduced human capacity in key organisations and professions, or the
weakness of intersectoral cooperation.
There were occasional, and weak, suggestions of unintended consequences. Where ECI
had placed unexpectedly high demands on organisations and individuals it was
occasionally suggested that this had diverted capacity from other work. UNICEF’s funding
of modelling had left an expectation among one government representative that UNICEF
would continue to fund work beyond what UNICEF intended. The scale-up of DOP without
sufficient government funding for schools to do it well was felt, by one interviewee, to
have risked diluting the concept of dropout prevention and inclusion, but this was a
consequence of government’s response rather than of modelling per se. Perhaps more
significant is the risk of wasted capacity and resources if modelling is undertaken without
sufficient clarity about, and targeted effort towards, the wider systems change needed to
support a model at scale. However, overall the evaluation provides no basis for concluding
that modelling has unintended negative consequences.
8.1.4. Implications for the future of modelling
The implications of this analysis is that continued work is needed to develop and support
each of the five models and to make them ready for further scale-up. Modelling as an
approach also needs to be strengthened. This should include more complete work to
110 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
develop, and refine in the light of early test, the key components of each model, and to
increase the rigour of evaluation.
Strengthening modelling also requires more recognition of the limitations of the service
system within which the models are developed, and an approach of iterative work to
improve and strengthen systems. This would imply initially developing models that are
closer to the current system capacity, and which are developed to be more ambitious as
system capacity increases. These approaches also call for more extended and targeted
work by UNICEF’s teams to influence government financial allocation, government
priorities and policies, and to build social and professional movements in support of
change for Serbia’s children and families.
Securing child rights and improving the lives of the most vulnerable children and families is
urgent business. UNICEF and the models are highly regarded, and viewed as working to
address needs of high relevance and priority. There are opportunities for UNICEF to
strengthen modelling and approaches to scale-up, including through applying learning
from implementation science. This has potential to accelerate progress, avoid wasted
investment and time and missed opportunities, and ultimately support UNICEF in its work
to advance child rights in Serbia.
8.2. Lessons learnt
• UNICEF’s modelling is powerfully demonstrating how improved support services for
children in Serbia might operate. UNICEF is very well positioned to build on this work
and its activity and people are very well viewed by all key stakeholder groups.
• Scaling up models depends on their fit with the current service and wider system. If
models are too ambitious for the current system, it will be very challenging to scale
them up and will likely required sustained extensive additional support.
• UNICEF’s ambitions are for more than scaled up delivery and involve systems change.
This requires portfolios of integrated activity, at model and system level. It is
inevitable that this work will not always proceed in a predictable and linear fashion,
and a much more agile and adaptive approach is needed.
• There is scope for UNICEF to develop its own capacity for advocacy, communication,
soft influencing, political analysis, evaluation and economic analysis.
8.3. Recommendations
In response to the evaluation findings, a set of eight recommendations have been
proposed regarding improving modelling and scale-up. The recommendations were
reached through a participatory process within the evaluation team and involving
discussions with the UNICEF programme teams, Country Office representatives and the
Regional Office, who provided feedback on initial recommendations on the basis of which
a final set of recommendations was developed.
The targets to action them are identified, along with an assessment of the urgency of
action and the likely impact the implications if the recommendation was not implemented.
These assessments are shown in Figure 8.1 after each of the eight recommendations is set
out.
111 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
There are some synergies between the recommendations. For example, actioning
Recommendation #1 (Create a comprehensive and integrated scale-up plan for each area
of systems change), would also make a significant contribution toward actioning the
advocacy recommendations (#6 and #7 respectively).
Recommendation 1: Create a comprehensive and integrated scale-up plan for each area of
systems change
Target: UNICEF Country Office programme teams and leadership
UNICEF’s ambition in relation to each of the exemplar models amounts to significant
systems improvement and change. This ambition is not always clearly set out in planning
instruments, visible to stakeholders, and the basis on which they commit to supporting
modelling. UNICEF needs to ensure that for each model there is a scale-up plan that sets
out the intended end goal, the social and systems level change sought, and a pathway and
integrated set of activities to change it which includes not only modelling but also
advocacy, research and communications. The plan needs to be consistently reflected in
equity focused theories of change (at both model and programme level, identifying how
the model contributes to the programme level ambition). It also needs to be reflected in
evaluation plans, budgets, communications and knowledge dissemination plans, annual
work plans and Result Assessment Module monitoring, so that these set out an integrated
and aligned programme of work oriented to the same high level change, with realistic
timelines. The plan should be developed with partners, and commitment secured from
partners to the full plan, rather than only to modelling activity. Annual work plans need to
be agreed with all relevant ministries, not just the lead ministry. In this way the change
ambition and the work required to secure it will be transparent to all stakeholders, the
commitment required will be clear, and weak or absent commitment will be visible more
quickly.
Urgency rating: High
Impact rating: High
High-level ambitions need to be consistently set out, and agreed across all UNICEF function
areas, and explicitly agreed with partners and stakeholders
Implications of not actioning: A risk of modelling not being clearly connected to systems
change with an integrated plan to achieve it to which UNICEF and partners are fully
committed, with clarity about roles and responsibilities.
Recommendation 2: Design models that are closer to the current system capacity
Target: UNICEF Country Office programme teams and leadership
Because UNICEF’s ambition is systems reform, the models are designed to demonstrate
what a future improved system could achieve. This creates barriers to scale up, since the
system conditions and supported needed for scale-up are not present. UNICEF needs to
design models that are closer to the capacity of the current system (i.e. the professional,
operational, organisational and strategic capacity of agencies involved in implementation)
by undertaking risk and assumptions analysis, systematically identifying where the system
is not sufficiently mature to sustain models, and planning work to improve the system.
Better alignment with the current system would also help to secure other stakeholders (for
example professional groups) as advocates for models, rather than UNICEF bearing longer
term responsibility for promoting them.
Urgency rating: High
Impact rating: High
The models as currently designed face barriers to scale-up to varying degrees.
112 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
Implications of not actioning: Models would demonstrate what could be achieved but
would not be implementable at scale, meaning wasted effort and resources and intended
impacts not secured.
Recommendation 3: Identify where UNICEF’s work needs to stimulate change in social
norms and behaviours and plan work to achieve this
Target: UNICEF Country Office leadership, programme, advocacy and communications
teams
UNICEF needs to identify where changes in social norms and behaviours are required to
address root causes of problems addressed by models, to build demand, or to create the
conditions for sustainable change. There needs to be more emphasis on building and
mobilising social movements. There is also scope to involve parents more directly as
partners in the co-production of models, to strengthen models and their fit with family
cultures and preferences, and to add credibility. Communications and knowledge
dissemination plans need to be aligned with modelling plans and ambitions, and to set out
the social change to which efforts are directed, the barriers and enablers and the shifts in
mindsets and attitudes required.
Urgency rating: Medium
Impact rating: High
Social movements present an opportunity to build pressure on government, and also to
promote models that challenge cultural or social status quo. Serbian government may be
increasingly sensitised to this pressure in the future.
Implications of not actioning: Scale-up not achieved because of misalignment between
models and social norms and behaviours, and absence of social demand or support for
models.
Recommendation 4: Improve the monitoring of achievements against the scale-up plan
Target: UNICEF Regional Office, UNICEF Country Office programme teams and leadership,
and monitoring and evaluation teams
UNICEF needs to improve its monitoring against the scale-up plan, monitoring not only the
delivery of the work planned, but also whether the necessary conditions and capabilities
for systems change are being developed, and where there remains resistance and barriers.
UNICEF needs to adopt a more dynamic, adaptive way of working where plans are
regularly reviewed, adapted, and additional work built in, or stages of work repeated, as
necessary. The ambitions of UNICEF’s work mean that progress is contingent on a changing
context and not fully predictable. UNICEF needs to plan for multiple scenarios and expect
non-linear progress. This particularly requires a different approach to Result Assessment
Module monitoring plans which are currently too narrowly covering whether intended
work has been undertaken, rather than whether intended purposes of that work have
been secured. This will require plans to articulate where the conditions and supports for a
model and wider ambition are not yet in place, and what needs to change, so that progress
in achieving that change can be assessed and monitored. Assessment is likely to draw on a
range of forms of evidence, from informal stakeholder feedback to more structured
measurement.
Urgency rating: Medium
Impact rating: Medium
This recommendation is most fully in UNICEF’s control and so could be implemented as a
priority, although the scope for teams to use governance systems in flexible ways means it
is less urgent.
Implications of not actioning: Not sufficiently adapting work in the face of changing
conditions or areas of resistance, contributing to misalignment between models and the
system conditions needed for scale-up
Recommendation 5: Improve the robustness of evaluation and its use to improve models
113 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
Target: UNICEF Country Office programme teams, leadership and monitoring and
evaluation teams
UNICEF needs to improve the robustness of both implementation evaluation and
effectiveness evaluation. Implementation evaluation needs to involve more rigorous
analysis of implementation strategies, barriers and enablers, and to be focused on the
aspects of implementation that are known to be determinants of programme
effectiveness. Effectiveness and outcomes evaluations need to be more rigorous, including
using comparative designs (so that impacts can be robustly attributed to models),
validated outcome measures, and measuring longer term outcomes across aspects of child
wellbeing. Existing international evidence can also be used creatively to make the case,
where effectiveness evidence is not yet available. Cost-effectiveness evaluations need to
be undertaken. A phased approach is needed, with research questions proportionate to
modelling phase. This evidence needs to be used to improve models to increase fit and
effectiveness, strengthen implementation strategies, and increase readiness for scale-up.
It would also highlight where a model has limited chance of success.
Urgency rating: High
Impact rating: High
More robust evidence would strengthen the models, help to avoid unintended negative
consequences, and support securing commitment to scale-up.
Implications of not actioning: Diminished ability to strongly and convincingly advocate for
scale-up of models. Risk of attempting to scale-up non-viable models or those of limited
effectiveness.
Recommendation 6: Strengthen political advocacy, skills and efforts
Target: UNICEF Country Office leadership, programme, advocacy and communications
teams
UNICEF needs to bring advocacy and modelling work into closer alignment so that they
work to the same objectives and plans. UNICEF should continue to develop political
analysis and influencing skills of Country Office staff in programme, advocacy and
communications teams. Nuanced analysis is needed to consider the fit of models with
government priorities. Although a model may initially be more ambitious than current
government priorities, this needs to be continually assessed to ensure that the gap is
bridged. UNICEF Country Office also needs to strengthen its initial and ongoing analysis of
political contexts, priorities and drivers, and the adaptation of work to align with this
analysis. There is a need to amplify and diversify approaches to advocacy, both advocating
directly to government and working indirectly through other institutions, individuals,
coalitions and social movements. Senior leaders at UNICEF need to play a key role in
advocacy efforts.
Urgency rating: High
Impact rating: High
Improving and better integrating political advocacy is key to securing political commitment
to change.
Implications of not actioning: Models are not scaled up because political commitment to
change is not secured.
Recommendation 7: Target and strengthen financial analysis and advocacy to influence
allocation of government and public financing
Target: UNICEF Country office leadership, programme and advocacy teams
UNICEF needs to strengthen its financial advocacy to influence the allocation of
government and public funding, in support of models. This needs to be part of the work of
Country Office leadership and programme and advocacy team, and clearly represented in
UNICEF’s planning instruments. UNICEF needs to set out a costed business case for
investment in modelling and scale-up, based on stronger financial analysis of both current
114 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
public financing and of the cost-effectiveness of models. Robust costed project proposals
need to be put to government at key points in the government financial decision-making
calendar between January and the end of August, with representations made at multiple
levels in relevant ministries including to Ministers, Ministerial Assistants, State Secretaries
and advisers as well as through other agencies with influence.
The format or instrument for these representations is less important than the strength of
business case made and its alignment with government priorities. The aim should be to
ensure that spending commitments are included in both the final budget and in the
government-wide annual work plan. Government financial commitment also needs to be
secured in the annual work plans between UNICEF and each ministry, so that these do not
only reflect UNICEF’s financial commitment.
Urgency rating: High
Impact rating: High
Financial advocacy is embedded in other advocacy work but there is scope for it to be
better attuned to political financial strategies.
Implications of not actioning: Financial considerations are likely to be an increasingly
significant aspect of government decision-making given fiscal constraint, and it is difficult
to see how scale-up can be achieved without a change in approach here.
Recommendation 8: Strengthen the focus on gender in model development, piloting and
planning for scale-up
Target: UNICEF Country Office programme teams
Although UNICEF’s modelling is oriented to addressing equity gaps and disadvantage
generally, there is scope to bring a stronger emphasis to gender in particular. This would
involve: understanding gendered experiences and causes of the need addressed (e.g.
school dropout), addressing these in model design and content, targeted strategies to
reach the boys and girls most in need, analysis of service barriers to effectively meeting
the needs of boys and girls, understanding and addressing gendered assumptions and
behaviours among staff, monitoring the reach to boys and girls and their satisfaction with
and outcomes from the service, and adapting the model as needed to address gender
issues identified. Better data on gendered differences in need, participation and outcomes
is key to this.
Urgency rating: Medium
Impact rating: Medium
Equity considerations are a strong focus in UNICEF’s work but if gender is to be prioritised
within this it requires a more attuned and purposeful approach.
Implications of not actioning: UNICEF will not know whether, why and how it is
perpetuating gendered differences in its modelling, and is unlikely to be directly impacting
on such differences.
Figure 8.1 maps the recommendations by reference to the urgency and impact ratings.
UNICEF is encouraged to focus first on the recommendations in the top right-hand corner
of Figure 8.1, as these recommendations are likely to have greater effect and to lay the
ground for other recommendations.

Country Office in Serbia in the period of 2016 – present time and inform strategic directions
for the next programme cycle. The independent evaluation is expected to begin in
December 2019 and to be completed by June 2019.
1. CONTEXT AND BACKGROUND
Serbia is making progress in legislative and public sector reforms and working towards
meeting international standards (the country ratified a number of human rights
conventions, such as CEDAW, CRC and CRPD in 2000s) in the fields of education, social
protection, health, justice and anti-discrimination. National averages for this middle-income
country look relatively good. However, disaggregated data show significant inequities
associated with poverty, rural areas and significant discrimination associated with ethnicity
and disability.
The total population of Serbia in 2019 is estimated at just under 7 million, children 0-17
make up 17 percent and youth (15-24 years) make up 10.6 percent of the population.
According to the 2011 census, more than half of the population (55.8 percent) lives in urban
areas.
Over time, absolute poverty in Serbia shows a stable trend at around 7 percent of people
who cannot satisfy basic needs. This means that basic needs cannot be fulfilled by
approximately 500,000 people. Data indicates that poverty is twice as common in non-urban
areas (10.5 percent versus 4.9 in urban areas), vulnerability is visible particularly in South-
Eastern Serbia, among children up to 14 years of age, youth (15-24 years), persons living in
households headed by someone with a low education level or by someone who is
unemployed or inactive.113 Therefore some 120,000 children (aged 0-18) and 40,000 youth
(aged 19-24) lived in absolute poverty in 2017. In Serbia, there is a stable trend of around
25 percent of the population which is at risk of poverty (25.7 in 2017, in comparison to 25
in 2014), while the EU28 average is 16.9 percent.114 More children are at risk of poverty than

among the general population (30.2 percent in 2017), and this trend is stable, with a low
increase rate (e.g. in 2014, there were 29.7 percent children at risk of poverty).115
Children from poor families and Roma children still encounter substantial obstacles
concerning access to education, attendance, the quality of education they are offered and
in their progression. Similar barriers may be faced by other groups of socially excluded
children, such as children on the move. As a result, many students fail to meet initial
expectations and are then frequently directed into programmes and education plans
intended for students with learning disabilities or drop out from school.
Children from vulnerable groups who are most in need of additional support for early
development and learning are the least involved in pre-school education, which suggests
that they face high inequity. According to MICS data from 2014, only 9 percent of poorest
children attend pre-school, 6 percent of Roma children, and 27 percent children from rural
areas attend pre-school. There is no reliable data on participation of children with disabilities
in preschool education, a study from 2012116 estimates 1 percent while according to data
on the number for pedagogical profiles (PP) or individual education plans (IEP) from
2017/2018, 0.89 percent of children had either PP or IEP in PSE. Although there are officially
no preschool institutions/facilities for the education of children with developmental
impairments117, the data indicate that there were 39.5 active special groups in 30 preschool
institutions attended by 364 children (0.17 percent) in the school year 2017/2018.118 While
no real time data are available on children on the move, it is noticed that migrant and refuge
children have access to pre-school, however their regular attendance might depend on a
number of factors.
The 2014 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) showed that only 69 per cent (63 for boys
and 76 for girls) of Roma children have timely primary school entry and 64 per cent complete
primary school, compared with 97 and 93, respectively, for all children. The proportion of
adolescents attending secondary school is 89 per cent for the general population, yet it is
only 22 per cent of Roma children (15 per cent girls). Administrative data show that 88 per
cent of girls and 81 per cent of boys have completed secondary school in Serbia. However,
one third of pupils aged 15 are functionally illiterate. This points to an education of
inadequate quality that requires further modernization of the curriculum and teaching
methods and intersectoral coordination to support inclusion and prevent dropout.
Since the introduction of inclusive education in 2009, the number of students in special
schools decreased by 25,3 percent (1,595 students)119, meaning that in the 2010/2011
school year, 1.09 percent of the student population was educated in special schools, while
in 2018/2019 0.89 percent of the total student population was educated in special schools.
The structure of students in special schools has also changed since 2009 – shifting from an
approach of categorising children according to the type of disability and exclusion of children
with multiple disabilities towards greater inclusion of children with multiple disabilities. In
2018, there were around 35 percent of children and students with multiple disabilities in
special schools.120
Since 2013 the overall number of children in alternative care has, although at slower pace

than in the previous period, continued to increase. In 2017, 88 percent of children without
parental care were placed into foster families and 12 percent into residential institutions.
Many girls and boys without parental care are therefore deprived of safe, trustful, stable
and stimulating relationships which leads to their unequal chances to reach their maximum
potential for an independent life. While it is encouraging that the total number of children
placed into institutions has decreased (from 961 to 761, or 17 percent), the number of
children placed into foster-care has increased in the same period (from 5,125 to 5,416 or
5.7 percent).121 Despite challenging circumstances, clear progress has been made towards
de-institutionalization. However, this process has not been felt equally by all children. There
is continuously a slightly higher number of boys predominantly among children with
disabilities in both residential and foster care. It is concerning, that despite the introduction
of a ban on placing children under-three years of age (2011) in institutional care, it continues
to occur. After a gradual decrease since 2012, it started to increase again in 2016, reaching
a total of 44 children in residential institutions in 2017. Community services are not yet fully
sustainable and therefore reach only a relatively small number of children.
According to official statistics, there were 3,465 juvenile criminal reports, and around 1,633
convictions in Serbia in 2017. Most reports and convictions are for boys.122 The trends in the
number of reports and convictions since 2013 are not linear but are in decline overall (9.9
percent decrease in reports since 2013). For juvenile criminal reports there is a small but
continuing increase in the number of girls (from 6.9 percent in 2013 to 10.1 percent in 2017).
In cases where crimes are committed by juvenile offenders, 30% of all victims are children
below 18. The application of diversion measures is on the rise (from 4 percent in 2013 to 9.5
percent in 2017), although there is scope for further increase. These measures could also
be applied in an earlier phase, before a criminal or court procedure is initiated.
In 2015, UNICEF developed its Country Programme Document (CPD) jointly
with Government partners for the period 2016-2020. The CPD was designed to be aligned
with key Government strategies, notably the EU accession process, the SDGs, and UNICEF
Strategic Plan 2014-2017. The CPD 2016-2020 is to a large extent a continuation of
strategies endorsed by the previous Country Programme and the comprehensive Mid-Term
Review conducted in 2013.
The overall goal of the Country Programme is to support the efforts of Serbia to promote
and protect the rights of all children and to give all children equal opportunities to
reach their full potential. The Programme focuses on supporting vulnerable children
from the very start of life and enhancing the social welfare system’s capacity to prevent
vulnerable families from falling below the poverty line.123 UNICEF strategies for unlocking
bottlenecks to the realization of child rights include advocacy, partnership, leveraging
resources, capacity development, evidence generation and modeling/piloting innovative
solutions.
2. OBJECT OF EVALUATION
For UNICEF country programmes of the ECA region, piloting and modelling have
“underpinned UNICEF’s policy advice, serving to inform policy reforms, test innovations,
and/or assess new approaches for policy implementation”.124

Country Programme Evaluation) is available in Annex 1.
124 “Modelling: A Core Role for UNICEF’s engagement in the CEE/CIS Region”. UNICEF, 2015
120 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
Piloting: testing a new theory of change where inputs are varied in order to try to effect a
different system change. (we do not know if it works at the beginning).
Modelling: demonstrating something that works in a new context to promote replication of
an established effective practice. (we know it works and we want others to adopt).
UNICEF and the Government of Serbia have launched a significant number of models over
the period of 2016-2019 in the areas of health, child protection, education and adolescent
programming. Modelling efforts include but are not limited to:
Programme Models
Child Protection Diversion of Children from Detention Measures
Intermittent Foster Care for Children with Disabilities
Family Outreach Worker
Education Drop-out Prevention and Intervention at the School Level
Inclusion of Child with Disabilities (CWD) in Pre-school
Access to Mainstream Education to Refugee and Migrant
Children
Many of the models did not have specific theories of change developed at the onset,
although most of them relate to and are part of wider sectoral theories of change.125 None
of the models has as yet been scaled up to national level. Brief descriptions of each of the
selected models are the following:
Diversionary Measures
The model aimed at practical application of core principles and procedures of child friendly
justice in Serbia that have already been incorporated into law, with the view to increase the
use and quality of diversionary measures. In doing so, the model attempted to strengthen
mechanisms to protect the best interests of children that come into conflict with the law,
reduce the number of children that are exposed to prolonged judicial proceedings, reduce
reoffending rates and decrease the burden placed on the judiciary by juvenile justice cases.
The model was implemented in 2015-2017 in the four largest cities in Serbia (Belgrade, Novi
Sad, Kragujevac and Nis), while in 2018-2019 this was expanded to municipalities in Serbia
with the highest juvenile offending rates where local authorities have expressed
commitment to invest in and sustain diversionary schemes. The costs of the model
implementation have not been estimated, due to the nature of the intersectoral
collaboration required for the model.
125 It is expected that the evaluation team reconstructs the ToCs for each model and applies them in the
analysis.
121 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
Intermittent Foster Care
The model envisaged assessment of new approaches for policy implementation, i.e. testing
the ways the already existing service (primarily designed as alternative family-based care)
can be upgraded to also serve birth families with children with disabilities (as respite,
prevention of burn-out, contribution to prevention of child/family separation).
The model was implemented in 2015-2016, in four large cities (Novi Sad, Belgrade,
Kragujevac and Nis). The costs of the model have not been fully estimated.
Family Outreach Worker
The Family Outreach Service aims to improve the capacities of families to provide for a
child’s safety, protection from neglect and abuse, and conditions for the good quality
development of the child in a family environment. It is intended for families with children
that have numerous and complex needs, where there is a risk of separation of the child or a
threat that the risk shall occur, and for families that are planning for the return of the child
to the family after the measure of separation from the family.
The model was launched in 2013, and supported by UNICEF till 2018 in four large cities (Novi
Sad, Belgrade, Kragujevac and Nis). The costs of the model have been estimated.
Drop-out Prevention and Intervention at the School Level
The main aim and intention of the model was to establish a system for timely identification
of and effective support for children and adolescents at risk of dropping out of school
through implementation of school and community-based measures.
The model was implemented in 2014-2016, in 4 primary and 6 secondary vocational schools
in 7 municipalities in Serbia (Vrbas, Kraljevo, Kragujevac, Pancevo, Bela Palanka, Surdulica,
Vladicin Han). The costs of the model have been estimated.
Inclusion of Child with Disabilities (CWD) in Pre-school System
The model aimed at introducing children with disabilities into joint activities with children
in mainstream groups. The changes this model initiated are related to desegregation of
segregated learning environments for young children and development of the shifting role
of defectologists to serve as expert support to preschool teachers working with all children
in preschool institutions in inclusive mainstream environments.
The model was implemented from 2016 till end 2018, in 3 preschool institutions in 3
municipalities. There is no estimated amount of resources spent on the model.
Supporting Access to Mainstream Education to Refugee and Migrant Children
The model was implemented in 2016-2018 and supported the access of migrant and refugee
children to mainstream education. In doing so, bottlenecks and barriers to inclusive
education were identified and addressed hence supporting the overall education sector
reform process to promote inclusive and multicultural education. The model looked
innovatively at refugee and migrant enrolment differently from the standard practice
occurring in traditional refugee settings due to the ‘transitory’ nature of their displacement
122 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
and the fact that migrants and refugees will likely not go back to their country of origin.
Secondly, the model focused on competence building rather than on knowledge sharing.
The model was initially piloted in a few municipalities and soon scaled up at a national level.
Whereas UNICEF’s budget for supporting access to mainstream education to refugee and
migrant children can be estimated from 500,000 to 800,000 USD from 2016 until April 2019,
it is challenging to define the amount spent on the model.
The above describes some of the different areas in which UNICEF (in partnership with
Government) has used a modelling approach. The main object of the evaluation is not,
however, the substantive areas listed above but the use of modelling as a strategy towards
scaled up national programmes and investments for Serbia’s most vulnerable children.
The Theory of Change for modelling, as inferred from the 10 sine qua non, can roughly be
summarised as follows: An innovative approach, with a clear theory of change on how the
approach will contribute to child well-being and reduce equity gaps, which involves key
stakeholders from the beginning and has a strong evidence generation focus (baselines,
rigorous monitoring and evaluation, public sector costing, etc.), if shown to be effective, will
be adopted by Government as policy and it’s roll-out and scale up will ensure coverage of
the entire target population of children.
3. STAKEHOLDERS TO THE EVALUATION
The evaluation will be used by a range of primary and secondary stakeholders. The primary
stakeholders are UNICEF in Serbia and the Government of Serbia (including relevant line
ministries and state bodies). Main government entities in the implementation of the
selected models include, among others: Ministry of Education, Science and Technological
Development; Ministry of Labour, Employment, Veteran and Social Affairs; Ministry of
Justice; Republic Institute for Social Protection; local self-government units.
Secondary stakeholders are the right holders and duty bearers that benefit from the models
and interventions. The rights holders include women and men, girls and boys, including
children with disabilities, Roma, refugees and migrants. Following the principle of
participatory evaluation, consultations with rights holders will be held.
UNICEF CO professionals at every level responsible for all strategic, design, implementation,
coordination, and monitoring-evaluation-learning aspects of programmes are to be involved
in the evaluation, to advance organizational learning on good practices in modelling.
UNICEF Regional Office is interested to test the theory behind the organizations modelling
work (see Annex 2), and their potential revision and/or further use.
The intended uses of evaluation are the following:
- Learning and improved decision-making (including through identification of lessons
learned and good practices in modelling);
- Inform scale up measures of existing models by Government but also potentially
through public-private partnerships;
- Lessons learned and good practices for national, regional and other stakeholders
already implementing or interested in applying modelling.
4. RATIONALE AND PURPOSE
123 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
The demand for the evaluation comes from UNICEF Serbia management, who are exploring
different strategic options with respect to a new Country Cooperation Programme 2021-
2025, and in response to a recent independent Country Programme Evaluation, which
observed that while some of the innovative models brought excellent results in
experimental settings, their replication and scalability were threatened by systemic
limitations and lack of a full understanding of the how modelling informs policy making,
public finance and Government programme decision-making processes.
The purpose of the evaluation is in obtaining primarily formative (forward-looking), to
support UNICEF CO and stakeholders’ strategic learning and decision-making with regard to
implementation of these and other models in the next programme cycle, as well as the CO’s
overall approach to modelling,
5. OBJECTIVES
The main objectives of the evaluation are the following:
1. Using a sample of current modelling efforts, evaluate and assess the extent to
which selected models have been designed in accordance with the 10
preconditions for successful modelling (see Annex 2);
2. Assess and identify implementation challenges that hindered or supported scale-
up of the models;
3. As compared to alternative strategies, assess the extent to which modelling was
the most efficient way of achieving the desired results (scaled up national
programmes for the most vulnerable);
4. Looking forward, assess the factors that may facilitate or further impede scale up
in the context specific to Serbia's Government systems and structures (particularly
in the areas of governance and financing) in the next programme cycle (2021-
2025);
5. Make recommendations that will help the Serbia CO optimize modelling as a
strategy in its next country programme;
6. Make specific recommendations that will help UNICEF optimize, replicate or scale
up the sampled models where feasible.
7. Based on the findings from 1-5 above, assess the sufficiency of the 10 pre-
conditions as a framework for guiding UNICEFs modelling efforts at country level.
6. SCOPE
In programmatic and operational terms, the evaluation will cover UNICEF’s implementation
of selected models during the period of 2016 - August 2019, beginning from concept stage
till scale up (where applicable) potentially also including models that are in an inception
phase and that may be taken to scale.
Due to varying geographical coverage of the models, the inception phase will be used for
determining the geographical sites and models that would best suit the evaluation
objectives.
7. EVALUATION QUESTIONS
The country programme evaluation 2019 indicated that UNICEF models were relevant and
yielded results (effectiveness and impact) when implemented under ideal conditions. Thus
the evaluation of modelling will focus more on the processes associated with modelling,
consideration of assumptions, and efficiency, cost effectiveness and sustainability issues. In
124 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
addition, the evaluation will incorporate equity, gender equality and human rights
considerations throughout all criteria and stages. Key evaluation questions (and sub-
questions) are clustered in accordance with the evaluation criteria provided. The initial
overarching and detailed lists (below) of questions will be further refined and unfolded by
the evaluation team and included in the Inception Report, following desk review of key
documents.
The main question that the evaluation should answer is: To what extent has the design and
implementation of models led to national scale-up? If not scaled up, what are the main
opportunities and impediments?
In addition to the above, the evaluation will also answer a more theoretical question on the
theory of change behind UNICEF’s modelling: “Is the ‘sine qua non’ a useful and sufficient
framework for guiding UNICEF’s modelling efforts?”.
Efficiency:
a. Are the models a cost-effective way of achieving results at scale?
b. Would the scale-up of models bring efficiency gains to existing governance
systems?
c. How can the efficiency of models and modelling be further improved?
d. Is modelling an efficient strategy for achieving the intended results of a country
programme?
Sustainability:
a. To what extent do stakeholders support the long-term objectives of the models?
b. Are there any risks, including political (such as commitment of and ownership of
results by authorities), governance (e.g. inability of the system to absorb changes
or incompatibility of governance structures and models) and financial, which
jeopardize the sustainability of the models?
c. Are there any identified funding sources that could introduce new opportunities
(e.g. IFIs, public-private partnerships) in order to take the models to scale?
d. To what extent do mechanisms, procedures and policies exist to allow duty bearers
to carry forward the results achieved?
e. What could be done to strengthen exit strategies and sustainability?
Scalability:
a. Were the model/s designed with scale in mind, from the start?
b. Are the model/s adapted to Government systems and/or able to use existing
infrastructure and resources?
c. Are the model/s demand-driven?
d. Is there proof of use/replication – if so by who and with what adaptations (if any)?
e. Have the model/s the ability and/or likelihood to expand from a limited scale to a
larger reach, adapt and sustain over time for greater impact?
f. Are there bottlenecks that might limit the ability of the model/s to scale? Are there
possible solutions identified to address those identified bottlenecks?
g. Do the model/s address problems common enough to be relevant in other
locations or contexts?
h. In the event of scale-up, what would be the minimum requirements for preserving
the fidelity of each model?
8. APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY
125 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
The evaluation will involve duty bearers and stakeholders in all stages, in accordance with a
highly participatory approach. To the extent possible, the evaluation may include rights
holders who are end users of results produced by models.
A preliminary evaluability self-assessment revealed availability of CO progress and annual
reports and a number of evaluations/ studies related to the models. Data provided by
national sources (e.g. Statistical Office) and through UNICEF onsite observations is deemed
reliable.
The following sources of information have been identified, whereas more detailed and
specific materials will be provided starting from the evaluation inception phase.
UNICEF/ external documents:
- UNICEF CO in Serbia Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) 2016 - 2019;
- CO Annual Reports 2016-2018;
- CO Annual Management Plans (2016-2019);
- UNICEF donor reports;
- UNICEF implementing partners’ reports;
- CO communication and advocacy materials;
- External evaluation of the model on Drop-out prevention and intervention at the
school level;
- Study on Piloting Outreach Service and Evaluation of Service Provision Outcomes,
Republic Institute for Social Protection (2018);
- External Evaluation on Supporting Families with Children with Disability –
Evaluating the Impact on Family and Child Wellbeing, University of Belgrade (2017)
- Law on Planning System
- Law on Foundations of the Education System
- Law on Social Protection
- Law on Juvenile Criminal Offenders.
A more in-depth evaluability assessment will be conducted by the evaluation team at the
inception phase to further inform evaluation methodology. A specific methodology will be
developed by the evaluation team and may include desk review/analysis, key informant
interviews, observations and field visits.
Methodological rigor will be given significant consideration in the assessment of the
proposals. Hence, consultants are invited to interrogate the approach and methodology
suggested in the ToR and improve on it, or propose an approach they deem more
appropriate, which should be guided by the UNICEF’s revised Evaluation Policy (2018)126, the
Evaluation Norms and Standards of the United Nations Evaluation Group (2016)127, UN SWAP
Evaluation Performance Indicator, UNICEF Procedure for Ethical Standards and Research,
Evaluation and Data Collection and Analysis (2015)128 and UNICEF-Adapted UNEG Evaluation
Report Standards (2017).129 Moreover, the evaluation should consider throughout the issues

126 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
of equity, gender equality and human rights. In their proposal, consultants should clearly
refer to triangulation, sampling plan and methodological limitations and mitigation
measures. They are encouraged to also demonstrate, wherever possible, methodological
expertise in governance and public finance areas, following human rights-based approach
and gender-responsiveness.
It is expected that the evaluation will employ a theory-based approach (by using the ToCs
reconstructed at the inception phase) and apply mixed methods, drawing on key
background documents, monitoring framework, and primary data that should be generated
through key informant interviews (KIIs).
All key documents, as noted above, together with a contact list of all relevant informants
will be provided to the evaluators once a contractual agreement has been made.
At a minimum, the evaluation will draw on the following methods:
- Desk review of background documents and other relevant data, including annual
planning documents, monitoring reports, and other documents judged relevant;
- Literature search and review, and analysis of secondary quantitative data, review
of material on the environment in which UNICEF operates, and recent plans and
strategies;
- Key informant interviews with Government, UNICEF CO and Regional Office,
donors, implementation partners, communities, and other stakeholders;
- Observations and field visits for direct exposure to the implementation of the
models, collection of beneficiaries’ and partners’ feedback and evidence needed to
respond to some evaluation questions.
Sampling of key informant interviews and field sites will be determined during the inception
phase, in consultation with UNICEF.
During the field mission phase, the team will be expected to visit selected sites and conduct
primary data gathering. Sites will be selected during the inception phase based on criteria
developed by the evaluation team in collaborating with UNICEF and other partners. The
selection criteria may include the following operational and contextual factors: a) Scale and
type of models; b) situation of children to whom support is provided; c) extent to which
UNICEF has successfully achieved expected results through model implementation. If
children and/or vulnerable groups are to be interviewed, an ethical review of the interview
protocol will be required.
The evaluation team is expected to present the theoretical framework against which the
scale-up pathways will be considered.
There are several limitations to the evaluation which can hinder the process, notably:
- Scale-up analysis is likely to require an assessment of political will and alignment
with budget processes. It is likely that there will be limitations to the information
that can be collected in this regard. As a mitigation measure, UNICEF would need
to leverage its contacts and partnerships, although it would not be able to control
the availability of information.
- Interviews with stakeholders will depend on their availability. Due to a considerable
number of response sites, it will not be feasible to visit all of them. Evaluation
127 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
sampling plan will explore mitigation of these and other related potential
limitations.
The evaluation should include the following steps:
Step 1: Desk review of relevant background documents and literature search. The evaluators
will review key background documents to understand the models and carry out literature
search of secondary data to understand the context in which they operate.
Step 2: Inception Mission. Upon the desk review, an inception mission to Serbia will be
organized for the evaluation team. The inception mission will aim to introduce the
evaluation to the team in the office as well as to important stakeholders, including members
of the Evaluation Reference Group with the objective to establish a common vision for the
evaluation.
Step 3: Preparation of Inception Report (IR) that includes in-depth evaluability assessment
that should, among other, specifically propose the evaluation methodology, tools and
protocols. The methodology should be prepared to cover all the intended objectives of the
evaluation. The evaluation methodology design will be finalized in agreement with the
Reference Group (see below), UNICEF and the Inception Report should be prepared based
on the Evaluation Norms and Standards of UNEG and submitted to the evaluation manager
for approval.
Step 4: Data collection. The application of mixed-methods (qualitative and quantitative) is
expected, which should be human-, and including child rights - based, and equity- and
gender sensitive, as noted above. The evaluators will seek to collect, use and report
disaggregated data wherever possible, and conduct interviews in a manner that encourages
active and equal participation of rights holders vis-à-vis duty bearers, among other.
Step 5: Data analysis. Collected data should be analysed by using relevant analysis methods
that should be clearly described in the inception report. All reported data will be
disaggregated wherever possible and gender overview of interviewed persons will be
provided.
Step 6: Sharing preliminary findings. The evaluators will share preliminary findings with the
Reference Group and UNICEF CO. While feedback will be taken into consideration and
incorporated into the draft report, the consultants are encouraged to guard against validity
threats, such as personal bias.
Step 7: Draft report. The consultants will prepare a draft report, with conclusions, lessons
learned and recommendations drawn from the data. The report structure should follow
UNICEF’s evaluation report guidance. Draft report should contain detailed financial
projections and timelines for each selected model’s scale-up, taking into account
fluctuations in funding availability.
Step 8: Finalization of the evaluation report. The consultants will present the final draft
evaluation conclusions and recommendations to the Reference Group, UNICEF and other
key stakeholders, using a Power Point Presentation and/or other methodologies for
presenting in a participatory manner and in an accessible language form, if needed.
Recommendations of the evaluation should also be presented, prioritized, and grouped
128 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
according to stakeholder groups. Comments and feedback on findings and
recommendations should be incorporated to finalize the report, as appropriate.
Good practices not covered therein are also to be followed. Any sensitive issues or concerns
should be raised with the evaluation manager (CRM/E Specialist in the CO) as soon as they
are identified.
A quality assurance (QA) review in line with UNICEF Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
for Research Studies and Evaluations (RSEs) will be applied to both Inception Report and
Final Draft Report. The QA is performed by the Country Office, using an external review
facility.
9. WORK PLAN
Evaluation Phases, Timing and Associated Deliverables
The evaluators are expected to produce the following key deliverables (please also refer to
the table on p.11):
1. Inception report (in English) of maximum 20 pages, excluding annexes, should
contain a detailed plan for evaluation, including data collection and analysis
methodology and tools, an evaluation matrix (as the main analytical framework
against which data will be gathered and analysed AND is shaped around the
evaluation questions, to be developed by the evaluation team leader and
agreed by the evaluation manager prior to the start of field work as part of the
inception report). The report will also contain a tentative outline of the final
evaluation report, quality assurance arrangements, identification and analysis
of and measures taken to address risks and proposed communication and
dissemination plan. Once the inception report is reviewed and the
methodology is agreed with UNICEF, the process of data collection will begin.
2. Final evaluation report (in English) of maximum 40 pages, excluding the
executive summary and the annexes, will be reviewed by UNICEF, ERG, and
other stakeholders, and finalized in consultation with UNICEF.
3. Detailed financial projections and timelines for each selected model’s scale-up,
taking into account fluctuations in funding availability and both public and
private funding opportunities (as part of the Final evaluation report).
4. Power Point Presentation (in English) summarizing the content of the final
report, projections and timelines (see deliverable #3).
5. A short recorded interview with the Team Leader
Other interim products may include:
- Minutes of key meetings with the evaluation manager and the ERG;
- Video and photo materials to be collected during the evaluation to enrich
presentations and the report; and
- Bi-weekly reports to the evaluation manager to track progress in the
implementation of the evaluation.
Reports will be prepared according to the UNICEF Style Guide and UNICEF Brand Toolkit (to
be shared with the winning applicants), UNICEF-Adapted UNEG Evaluation Report Standards
129 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
(2017) and GEROS Quality Assessment System.130 All deliverables must be in professional
level standard English and must be proofread by a native English speaker.
The first draft of the final report will be received by the evaluation manager who will work
with the evaluators on necessary revisions in consultation with the country and regional
teams before sending the report to the ERG for comments. The evaluation manager will
consolidate all comments on a response matrix and request the evaluation team to indicate

11. SELECTION CRITERIA
Interested companies are requested to submit their technical and financial proposals by 20
October 2019.
After the opening, each proposal will be assessed first on its technical merits and
subsequently on its price. The proposal with the best overall value, composed of technical
merit and price, will be recommended for approval. UNICEF will set up an evaluation panel
composed of technical and procurement staff and their conclusions will be forwarded to the
internal UNICEF Contracts Review Committee, or other relevant approving authority.
The evaluation panel will first evaluate each response for compliance with the requirements
of the request for proposal (RFP) procedure of UNICEF. Responses deemed not to meet all
of the mandatory requirements will be considered non-compliant and rejected at this stage
without further consideration. Failure to comply with any of the terms and conditions
contained in this RFP, including provision of all required information, may result in a
response or proposal being disqualified from further consideration.
The overall weighting between technical and price evaluation will be as follows: The
technical component will account for 70% of the total points allocated and the financial
component will account for 30% of the total points allocated.
The assessed technical score must be equal to or exceed 40 of the total 70 points allocated
to the technical evaluation in order to be considered technically compliant and for

137 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
Annex 2 – Theory of Change for modelling
A theory of change for modelling was developed by the CEI evaluation team based on
interviews with UNICEF staff and project teams undertaken during the Inception Mission
and in the first phase of the evaluation, and documentation provided by UNICEF.
The theory of change incorporated elements commonly described by UNICEF teams and
that appear to be reasonably consistent aspects of modelling across the five exemplar
projects. These elements are not necessarily undertaken in every instance of modelling.
The theory of change is based around:
• Inputs: what needs to be in place before modelling activity begins
• Activities: what activity is carried out in modelling
• Outputs: what is created during and after modelling
• Outcomes: what changes are achieved by modelling
• Long term impacts: what are the long-term consequences of these changes for
children and families
The theory of change informed the aspects of modelling that were explored in the
evaluation, particularly in the interviews with stakeholders and review of documentation.
The evaluation reviewed whether the inputs and activities described in the theory of
change were available or carried out and in what forms, whether the intended outputs
were created or achieved, and whether the intended outcomes and impacts were secured.
The evaluation team refined the theory of change in light of findings of the evaluation.
These are shown in the summary figure overleaf and in the Detailed Elements (in blue
font):
• Inputs: Additional emphasis was placed on ensuring the model is fit for the
operating context.
• Activities: Advocacy, communications and workforce capacity strategies (also
listed as outputs) were incorporated in earlier activities of modelling as well as
shown as outputs
• Outputs: Advocacy, communications and workforce capacity strategies need to
be revisited, reviewed and updated
• Outcomes: Commitment should be to the intended pathway and vision for scale-
up
• Long term impacts: no changes.

Annex 3 – Model Summaries
Family Outreach Worker
The Family Outreach Worker model aims to improve capacities of
families’ capacity to provide for their child, accounting for their
safety and reducing the frequency and impacts of separation.
Model Background
The Family Outreach Worker (FOW) model is part of UNICEF’s work to reduce the number of
children in institutions, by supporting families. It is a new, intensive family support service, in
which a FOW works directly with around 9-12 families over the course of 8-12 months, meeting
weekly with families and coordinating other care. The Family Outreach Worker is a professional
in the field of social welfare, whose work is supported by an expert team from its institution
(manager, supervision) and coordinated with the Centre for Social Welfare.
Practitioners operate under the principles of working with and not instead of the family;
appreciating family expertise; involving the family in decision-making; fostering relationships
between families and professionals.
Who is it for?
The service provides practical support, education/advice to parents and advocacy /community
coordination to:
• Families with children who have multiple and complex needs and a risk of separation
of the child
• Families planning for the return of the child to the family after period of separation
• Children in or at risk of out of home care
• Families disproportionately impacted by extreme poverty, unemployment, disability,
mental illness, unstable housing.
The service also has a discretionary support fund at its disposal to resolve urgent family issues
such as household equipment or repairs.
Model activities and indicators
The family support service is underpinned by an evaluation and family plan that includes any of
the following activities:
• Practical support; for example, guidance or assistance in social welfare, healthcare,
insurance (e.g. health or disability), employment, cultural content, education or
disability support.
• Counselling and education activities; for example, capacity building for families,
motivation, modelling, demonstration of behaviour, guidance and other activities
aimed at strengthening and improving family relations and promoting a quality,
positive development for the child.
• Representation, mediation and coordination in the community.
Indicators of progress or success among families using the service include:
• Educational engagement
• Improved child health
• Improved nutrition and hygiene
• Improved family relationships
• Improved emotion regulation
• Fewer child separations
140 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
Partnerships with UNICEF
Family Outreach Worker has received support and partnered with several organisations in
Serbia, from government ministries, NGOs and service providers.
• The Ministry of Labour, Employment, Veterans and Social Affairs (MLEVSA) supported
the design of the model and piloting
• Republic Institute for Social Protection (RISP), which oversaw the piloting process and
provided the link between model design and service delivery
• Service providers (residential institutions for children and youth) in each of the four
pilot cities worked with Centres for Social Welfare who referred families and provide
case management. These organisations were:
o Dusko Radović (Niš)
o Centre for Protection of Infants, Children and Youth (Belgrade)
o SOS Children Village (Sremska Kamenica – Novi Sad)
o Kneginja Ljubica (Centre for development of local services) (Kragujevac)
o The Novak Djokovic Foundation contributed funding for the design and piloting
of the service.
Implementation activity
2014-17 was the main period of implementation for the model, occurring in Belgrade, Novi Sad,
Kragujevac and Niš. These cities were chosen for their significant reach and the capacity of the
residential institutions to deliver the service. The service reached a total of over 1500 families
and 3400 children during modelling period.
Piloting and initial implementation was funded by the Novak Djokovic Foundation, and the
second phase (during which program was extended to children with disabilities) by IPS/EU
funding. The piloting process included sourcing workers from centres for children and youth
working in the surrounding municipalities. However, this wasn’t effective; UNICEF concluded
that the FOW has to be embedded in the local community to be able to leverage resources
minimise practitioner burden (e.g. travel).
Initial implementation concluded that UNICEF’s preferred model would be for local workers to
be employed by and within the Centres, based in the communities and connecting with the
Centre as need - but this is still to be tested.
Evaluation and evidence
Three key evaluation projects of the model have been undertaken; by RISP (2014-16), the
University of Belgrade (2017) and PluriConsult (2018). The most prominent messages from
these evaluations were:
• The model is relevant to the social welfare system, the workforce and families
accessing the service with high potential for further roll-out
• The model has made progress in terms of family capacity to provide safety to children,
reducing neglect and violence and decreasing separation. There was also a reduction
in the number of children in residential care during this time, but this cannot be
causally attributed to the model.
• The model strengthened professional relationships and competencies among
practitioners, including those from within Centres for Social Welfare.
• A recommendation for tailoring intensity to family needs; embedding the principles in
other services and building on informal community support networks.
• Cross-sectoral cooperation and sufficient system capacity were important enablers to
implementing the model and to provide necessary support.
Cost-effectiveness of the model pilot was discussed both financially, as well as in relation to
141 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
human resources and time investment. It was reported that the programme funds, comprising
not only service delivery, but management, administrative and fundraising plus demonstrated a
good level of efficiency:
“The Family Outreach Service suspends the neglect and abuse of children in the family,
strengthens families and encourages their independence. Therefore, this could represent a
cheaper method of support for the country, and a more effective support for the family than
the separation of the child.”
142 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
Intermittent Foster Care
Intermittent Foster Care aims to improve the quality of life of families caring
for children with disabilities through providing respite support. It also is
designed aid the development and growing up of children in family
environment, preservation of family power and family community and reduce
social isolation.
Model Background
Intermittent Foster Care provides respite fostering care for children with disabilities. It aims not
only to provide support to families and high-quality care for children, but also to connect
children and families with supports and assets in their local community and aid their inclusion.
It aims to strengthen a service that already exists rather than to introduce a new service.
Who is it for?
The target beneficiary group is children with complex disabilities and their families. This service
should contribute to:
• Improving the living conditions of the entire family,
• Preventing the separation of a child from the family,
• Offering parents the possibility of a different engagement(s) with the aim of
preventing social isolation of the family.
Model activities and indicators
There are three main model activities of forms of service available:
• Short daily respite for children with disabilities:
Child care for an hour or two on certain days when the primary parents have some
requirements, or due to the needs of the child: involvement in swimming lessons,
learning certain skill or mastering the school curriculum, going to a sports game,
sports and cultural activities etc. This provides new experiences for the child, it
develops its social skills and independence, expands horizons, and its parents have an
opportunity to spend in the same - similar way that time with their friends or in some
other way "recharge their batteries" and strengthen.
• Short multi-day respite for children with disabilities:
During weekends, part of holidays or several days due to the needs of parents -
treatment, finishing of certain activities, preparation of the other child in the family
for enrolment in school, university, and a number of other reasons. Depending on the
length of the stay, the plan for the child shall define the contents of the service aimed
at acquiring new experiences for the child, that will provide new skills and
involvement of the child in the community
• Short respite for babies with disabilities:
Support to the primary family for a few hours a day, primarily in the parents’ family
home, with the goal of providing rest but also support to meet certain needs of the
child where the parents are not adapting well, or require support themselves.
Periodical foster parents assist the parents in developing parental skills of caring for
children with disabilities and have a role of moderator of parental skills
143 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
Partnerships with UNICEF
• Centres for Social Work (CSW): Oversee applications for the service.
• Centres for Foster Care and Adoption: Oversee assessment of carers. Service standards
and processes are set out in draft guidelines. Carers also receive training and support from
Centres for Foster Care and Adoption.
Other key stakeholders are:
• Ministry of Labour, Employment, Veterans and Social Affairs (MoLEVSA)
• Provincial Institute for Social Protection in Vojvodina - modelling and evaluation partner.
Implementation activity
The service was implemented by six Centres for Foster Care (CFC) and Adoption. These operate
regionally but their capacity is limited. Centres for Social Work (CSW) provide assessment and
cover for CFCs as necessary.
Modelling was initially conducted on a small scale in four municipalities (Novi Sad, Belgrade,
Kragujevac and Niš) by regional Centres for Foster Care and Adoption, working with Centres for
Social Work. Initial modelling covered 20-30 families and lasted for one year.
The service has survived in Novi Sad despite the fact that the regulations have not been passed
and funding isn’t available. The CFC there is seen as a strong service provider and the region (as
per Family Outreach Worker) dynamic and solution-focused.
A key challenge in implementation already encountered in the small-scale was authorization of
the ad hoc payments to carers. Foster care is usually funded through monthly payments, but
because the involvement of an Intermittent Foster Carer is ad hoc and varies according to a
child’s changing needs, CSWs needed to do a new authorisation every month to authorize
payment of whatever hours an IFC had provided.
Evaluation and evidence
In the evaluation of modelling, families have shown a degree of satisfaction with the model,
suggesting or recommending their carer in almost all cases.
Main evaluation reports are:
Supporting families with children with disability (University of Belgrade)
This small-scale evaluation found the following key themes:
• Positive and sustainable effects of the service were recorded in 2/3 of interviewed families
• Complex family situation requires complex and tailored interventions (i.e. the model
appears appropriate and proportional to the need).
• The quality of the relationships with social workers from the Centre for Social Work has
improved in a number of families during the service use
Summative Evaluation of the Efforts to Strengthen Social Work Welfare System (PluriConsult)
Evaluation concluded:
• Service was viewed positively and was helpful to parents and children although with
less impact on connections with formal and semi-formal support networks
• Some positive impacts reported on the practice of CSW and CFC staff
144 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
• Flexibility and simplification of procedures is needed
Costs analysis
There is a paucity of direct cost analysis information directly related to the effectiveness of this
model. IFC and the Family Outreach Worker models have been funded by both the EU-IPA and
Novak Djokovic Foundation for over €2million.
145 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
Diversionary Measures
The Diversionary Measures model focuses on alternative sanctions for
juvenile offenders. It combines in-depth sectoral training with
mobilisation of local cross-sectoral teams to enable the prioritisation of
restorative approaches and reintegration over convictions.
Model Background
The Juvenile Justice Law of 2006 introduced Diversionary Measures (DMs) in Serbia. However,
these were not systematically followed; the model was designed as to fill these procedural and
practical implementation gaps regarding diversion schemes and alternative sanctions. The
models focus on enhancing capacities for application of diversionary measures and alternative
sanctions for juvenile offenders, ultimately harnessing restorative approaches and reintegration,
focused on interventions with child offenders and their families, and reduction of recidivism.
Who is it for?
Young people involved in the law and their parents/guardians. The intended outcome is that
juvenile offenders are diverted to alternative restorative and reintegrative sanctions as
opposed to the mainstream justice system. It is hypothesised that this approach will improve
long-term outcomes for young people, in terms of education, employment and social status.
Recent estimates indicate the rate of child offending in Serbia is approximately 2 per 1000
children (over 3000 per year). Socially excluded and vulnerable children are more likely to come
into conflict with the law than other children:
• 20% of juvenile offenders are poorly engaged in or have never attended school.
• 15-19% of juvenile offenders are from single parent families
• 3-4% of juvenile offenders are in out of home care (0.5% of general population)
Model activities and indicators
Centres for Social Work (CSW) assess the child as suitable for a DM. The order is made by the
judge. CSWs and/or NGOs provide the measure. CSWs are responsible for providing or
stimulating local provision, case management, and for training community providers.
Republic Institute for Social Protection provided training to judges and prosecutors, with the
intention to build a network of community provision.
There are guidelines and handbooks for assessments, guardianship reports and interventions
and accredited training.
Partnerships with UNICEF
• Juvenile Justice Council
• Judicial Academy
• Ministry of Justice
• Ministry of Social Welfare
• Republic Institute for Social Protection (RISP) – supported implementation, provided
training
• Centres for Social Work – do assessment, provide diversionary measures
• NGO Child Rights Centre – involved in development
146 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
• Other NGOs, such as Centar GRiG) – provide intensive diversionary measures and
implementation support
Implementation activity
There have been three implementation /modelling periods:
• The main implementation period was 2014-17 in 4 cities: Belgrade, Novi Sad, Kragujevac
and Niš, with the intention of providing intensive DMs and developing multi-sectoral
cooperation. RISP also provided training to judiciary and prosecutors in other areas. It is
understood that the model has continued in these four cities.
• An alternative approach was tried 2018/19 where the NGO Centar GRiG worked with
municipalities in areas with higher juvenile offending rates aiming to provide DMs (not
intensive) and to stimulate more orders and more provision. Their intention was to spread
‘horizontally’ through engaging these municipalities about which approaches were thought
to work/be the best fit for each site.
• Currently, UNICEF and RISP are working with additional high-priority areas, training
judiciary and prosecutors and supporting CSW to provide DMs and to stimulate inter-
sectoral cooperation. Both the GRiG and RISP approaches are based in municipalities
selected from an indicative list of priority areas: Paraćin, Zrenjanin, Sombor, Sjenica,
Jagodina, Kraljevo, Batočina, Kruševac, Aranđelovac and Novi Pazar.131
Evaluation and evidence
Since 2013, the number of diversionary orders has more than doubled, from 480 to 1034. This
increase has seen the proportion of juvenile cases diverted from the justice system rise from
12% in 2013 to 28% in 2016. An evaluation, led and published by MAP Consulting Ltd., Croatia
(2017) which reports that:
• DMs are routine practice but that service provider networks need to be more diverse and
intersectoral cooperation needs to be developed
• No clear model for financing
• Need for standardised monitoring system
• Need database of providers
• Need to monitor impact on recidivism
This evaluation found a larger increase in the use of DMs outside the modelling cities. There
isn’t further data on this (i.e. no data showing the impact of the UNICEF program). There is also
no data on impact on recidivism.
Another report conducted by The University of Belgrade reports that DMs are more routinely
practiced and that networks of service providers have been developed.
There are currently two systems for ‘counts’ of DMs issued which complicates evaluation:
RISP’s monitoring of DM orders uses data from CSWs, while central statistical offices use data
from the judicial system. To our knowledge, these have not been aligned.
Regarding costs, the MAP report states the initial 2 years of modelling was funded
USD$1,870,000. Cost benefit analysis confirmed that the implementation of diversionary
measures is more cost effective than the implementation of alternative sanctions.
“The procedure of enforcing diversionary measures costs almost three times less than regular
court proceedings, which contributes to the overall efficiency of the judicial system."

Early Childhood Intervention
The model aims to increase the meaningful participation of children with
developmental delays and disabilities in family and community life
through development of functional skills, independence, relationships
and engagement.
Model Background
To better support children with developmental difficulties, the Early Childhood Intervention
(ECI) model moves to a more family-centred and strengths-based approach, building a single of
team of experts from health care, social protection and pre-school education around children
with developmental difficulties, working to an individual family service plan, with one
professional as the primary service provider.
Who is it for?
• Children (aged between 0-5) with developmental delay(s) and/or disability and their family
are intended to benefit from this model. The family is supported to integrate supportive
interactions into their daily life with the intention of preventing and minimise secondary
developmental difficulties. Involvement with the model is also intended to promote
positive learning dispositions and lay the foundation for inclusive education and lifelong
learning.
• Children and families generally exit the programme by the time the child is 6 and a half at
latest.
On a broader level, it hopes to reduce current and future societal costs in education and social
support and exist to ensure child rights are met according to national and international laws.
Model activities and indicators
The model involves:
• Outreach and screening to identify eligible children:
Initial universal screening (the model has clear entry and eligibility and exit criteria) and
referral to the Child Development Unit for further screening.
• Developing an Individual Family Support Plan (IFSP), which is reviewed every 6 months
• Referral of the family to the ECI team, where more comprehensive assessment carried out
• Weekly visits, setting goals, noting whether achieved, agreeing next steps.
Consultation and coaching for the parent provided by the primary service provider.
Services are provided by the public health centre, pre-school institution and/or social
welfare centre.
• Transition plans are developed for starting pre-school and school. When the child starts at
pre-school and then school there is a plan for further support including the inclusive
education team
• There is detailed documentation of roles, procedures and standards, training and required
qualification levels for professionals, limits on caseload. Generally, public health centres
carry most of this caseload at present.
Partnerships with UNICEF
• Belgrade Psychology Centre (BPC) – partners in implementation, provide coordination and
support for sites
• Ministry of Health
• Ministry of Education
• Ministry of Social Welfare – involved on national advisory board
• Professional associations (paediatricians, health mediators, nurses-teachers in ECEC – on
board
148 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
• Other consultants / board members also provide modelling support
Implementation activity
Full implementation occurred in Leskovac, Kragujevac, Niš, Sremska Mitrovica and Belgrade
(Rakovica municipality). Partial implementation of the model occurred in Čukarica and New
Belgrade.
Capacity building has been completed in the first two areas (Rakovica-Belgrade and Leskovac),
with UNICEF continuing to support them for 18 months. Implementation is at an earlier stage in
the five expansion sites; however, one site has since withdrawn.
In 2017/19, 99 professionals were trained, 70 families received the service. In 2020/21 there
are plans to train further professionals, a team of national trainers, work with more families,
revise the model based on evaluation, develop funding and sustainability mechanisms with the
Ministries and local partners, and develop more resources.
There has been some resistance from professionals and parents. Parents view the program as
additional work, and some would prefer to buy or use other professionals to provide the
support. This is especially relevant in Belgrade, where private use of therapy services is typically
more common.
Evaluation and evidence
There are no evaluative reports or costing analyses yet available. BPC have established a system
to monitor achievement of goals in children’s plans, with an external evaluation set to occur,
however this has been delayed by COVID-19.
The intended results of the model include:
• Improved competencies of workforce across sectors to coordinate and deliver care
• Improved coverage of ECI services to eligible children and families
• Increased caregiver awareness of benefits of ECI
• Increased caregiver motivation to support functional improvement of children
• Improved ECI services

Drop-Out Prevention
The school Drop-Out Prevention model aims to maintain and retain
children engaging in school and receiving the beneficial outcomes of
greater exposure to the education system.
Model Background
The model is designed to be a targeted support resource that lies within a school’s suite of
services and aligns with existing legal frameworks and critically, human and financial resources
in schools.
The model was borne of the following rationale:
• Equity gaps in access to and completion of education in Serbia, have been identified,
based on available evidence;
• There is a gap in the systematic collection of data on dropout and students at risk of
dropping out and effective planning for dropout prevention.
• Institutional needs at national and school levels and students and family needs as
described in national research reports and available evidence;
• National and EU priorities: Dropout prevention was an education quality priority for the
Strategy of Education Development in Serbia 2020 (SDES 2020). EU Education and Training
Agenda for 2020 and the target of reducing Early School Leaving below 10%.
Who is it for?
The model supports children who are at risk of early drop out or poor attendance in school. In
Serbia, children most at risk of drop out/exclusion include:
• Children from poor/disadvantaged families
• Children from Roma communities
• Children in care
• Children with disabilities
• in Serbia, girls are at greater risk of school drop-out than boys
Model activities and indicators
The model harnesses an early warning system to identify at risk students. It also helps build
capacity for:
• Teachers- addressing school climate and culture
• Schools- improvements to parental engagement, changes to teaching methods, peer
support and mediation teams, support for transitions, extra curriculum activities and
support for learning
A drop-out prevention team was established in each of the 10 modelling schools, and individual
plans for children developed. There are also guidebooks for schools, guidelines, accredited
training and other resources; all with the intention that the model would be an intervention
that could be delivered by the existing system without needing additional staff.

Partnerships with UNICEF
• Centre for Education Policy (CEP) – developed the programme alongside UNICEF
• Faculty of Philosophy
• National Education Council – were partner for a while but lost their overseeing role
• Ministry of Education
• Ministry of Social Welfare
• Group for Social Inclusion – identified by UNICEF as entry point following loss of
power of NEC
• Republic Institute for Social Protection (RISP)– partner in development and
implementation, provides training
• Ministries of Youth & Sport and Health were on the model advisory group
• Institute for Improvement of Education – responsible for school improvement
• Centres for Social Work and Health Centres – provide local level support, should be
part of school network
Implementation activity
The main modelling activity occurred in 10 schools (4 primary and 6 secondary) in 7
municipalities (Vrbas, Kraljevo, Kragujevac Pancevo, Bela Palanka, Surdulica and Vladicin Han),
published in the ‘How to be a Caring School’ report, 2016. Schools chosen were based on
highest numbers of at-risk students. Pilot reached total of 7000 students and 700 teachers.
There has been other linked work including:
• Work with CEP to sensitise the social welfare system to drop out
• SHARE project which provided peer support by excellent schools to poorer schools –
which has been taken up by the Institute for Evaluation of Education Policies.
Evaluation and evidence
UNICEF’s evaluation of modelling (with external evaluation of impact on school culture) found
positive results on absenteeism (30% decrease), grade repetition (23% decrease), culture and
climate and drop out levels (66% decrease), with some data on academic achievement
improvement, compared with rates prior to implementation.
The evaluation noted the following key points:
• The experience of modelling this programme emphasises the need to push for an
agenda on school improvement and inclusive education
• Flexibility is important for student engagement
• Remedial teaching needs more support
• Schools need a wider understanding of risks of drop-out and subsequently
• Inter-sectoral cooperation needed; education is crucial, but should not the only sector
with direct involvement
• Campaigning for the importance of education and peer support for schools (staff and
pupils) is required
Evidence from a costs analysis has shown that the model can be implemented without
additional staffing.

Annex 6 – Costing the models
Each of the models has different types of activities, and available documentation regarding
the costs varies across the models. Only the costs for FOW were provided and calculated in
detail. Key considerations in costing the models are:
• FOW: This is the only service for which a detailed cost price has been developed.
The price (cost) of the FOW service was calculated in two ways: i) based on
empirical data for the service piloting period and ii) as a hypothetical price, i.e.
how much the service should cost when entirely ’settled’ and functioning in
accordance with the envisaged standard.
• IFC: There are several aspects to be considered that are related to the costing of
this service. First, the available empirical data should be taken into account, as
this service has been provided continuously in Novi Sad132. Second, the manual
with detailed guidelines for IFC is available and it contains the list of activities and
cost suggestions for all the main activities133, which could form the basis of further
cost analysis. Funding of the model includes a monthly allowance for foster
families with formulas for their calculation and states which activities are not
currently funded. Therefore, areas such as transportation costs should potentially
be included in the model and regulated as well as potential other items such as
in-kind assistance in commodities such as textbooks etc.
• DMs: This is the model with the most complex types of activities, which need to
be included in the costing procedure, along with promotion and advocacy
activities
• ECI: There are several components of ECI model that would need to be included
134 field work to identify children and families who will use the services; the
service itself (according to the defined plan), and monitoring and evaluation. The
price of ECI could be calculated based on empirical data from the current
modelling, although further work will be needed once a stable delivery system
has been identified.
• DOP: Further work is needed to identify which of the components need more
financial support.
• UNICEF was also interested to know what competencies would be needed in their
team to complete the costing activity. A person with a BA in Economics and
specialised in economic analysis (cost benefit analysis, financial analysis, basic
accounting) is needed. Knowledge of programme budgeting is an advantage
especially if UNICEF is considering approaching government funds.
In terms of the costing procedure, one of the most common ways for measuring costs is
the ‘ingredients method’ – where all costs are identified, valued (identifying the number of
units needed and assigning a price to each ‘ingredient’) and then adjusted according to the
needs. The ingredients method was developed as a method for conducting cost-
effectiveness analyses in education and other public sectors.135 It outlines and describes
all of the ingredients used to implement a policy or a programme and is based on the idea

135 It was developed by Henry Levin, Professor of Economics and Education at Columbia University's Teachers
College
154 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
that every intervention consists of ingredients of certain value or cost. The important part
of this method is that it can be applied to empirical data if the service is already being
provided (as in the case of the exemplar models), or the costs of necessary resources for
the establishment of service can be simulated (hypothetical price).
The important part of every cost analysis is that it should be conducted independently of
financial sources, including in-kind resources such as volunteers.
Since the exemplar models have different types of ‘ingredients’ or activities and due to
lack of data and detailed information on all the activities, it is not possible to list a clear set
of criteria for every model. However, several steps that could serve as a guideline for every
cost analysis are summarized below: 136
1. The first step is the identification and specification of ingredients – dividing ingredients
into several main categories that have common properties. Typically, that would be
personnel, facilities supplies and other resources, listed with descriptive data outlining
the ingredients quantity and qualitative features.
• Personnel include all of the human resources required for each of the alternatives
that will be evaluated. This category includes full-time personnel, part-time
employees, consultants, and volunteers. All personnel should be listed according
to their roles, qualifications, and time commitments.
• Facilities refer to the physical space required for the intervention. This includes
listing all facilities including donated facilities.
• Equipment and materials include variety of staff and they should all be listed,
including if they are allocated only for the specific intervention or if shared with
other activities.
• Other inputs such as telephone service, electricity, heating, internet access fees,
etc. Any ingredients that are included in this category should be specified clearly
with a statement of their purpose.
Documents, interviews, and other empirical data can be used for identifying these
ingredients or resources.
2. Based on the descriptions, each ingredient should be valued according to its cost,
typically using a national market price or shadow prices137. The model’s total cost and
cost per unit should be calculated. The important part of the analysis is to use national
prices in order to rule out problems of local market variability, except in cases when
certain interventions are limited to specific areas. 138
3. The third step involves the estimation and analysis of different types of costs (total,
average and marginal). These costs can be presented in the form of simple worksheets,
on an annual basis.
136 Levin H., McEwan, P., (2002), Cost-Effectiveness And Educational Policy, available at
https://www.academia.edu/32362875/Cost_Effectiveness_and_Educational_Policy
137 Shadow price—the true value or cost of the results of a particular decision, as calculated when no market price
is available; a dollar value attached to an opportunity cost.
138 Levin H, McEwan P., Belfield C., Brooks Bowden, A., Shand ., (2014) Economic Evaluation in Education: Cost-
Effectiveness and Benefit-Cost Analysis
155 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
4. If effectiveness data are available, costs of alternative interventions should be paired
with effects to estimate cost-effectiveness ratios.
There are two modes of cost analysis:
1. Cost- effectiveness analysis - compares two or more programs according to their
effectiveness and costs in accomplishing a particular objective. Cost-effectiveness
analysis is a fundamentally comparative endeavour. That is, it allows us to choose
which of two or more alternatives is relatively more cost-effective, but it does not tell
us whether an alternative is worthwhile in some absolute sense.
2. Cost-benefit analysis – where the outcomes of an alternative are directly expressed in
monetary terms. For example, a clear benefit on drop- out prevention and intervention
model are the increased earnings in the future that could be linked to education. Also it
is shown that investment in DMs could be cheaper for society than costs of detentions.
139 In this manner it can be proven that investing in this new method is cheaper for the
society in the long-term (besides being more effective in child rights terms). There are
variety of techniques to place monetary values on a wide range of outcomes
The minimum level of analysis for the five exemplar models should include at least the first
three steps from the listed ingredients method and the empirical data for them should be
available. Cost-effectiveness analysis and cost- benefit analysis are ideal complements and
parts of the costing analysis that can provide full picture for financing.
Special attention should be placed to identifying what should be financed on the national
level and what on the level of a local self-government (LSG), prioritising national level
financing where possible given the greater financial resources available. If activities need
to be financed from local budgets, LSGs could be grouped according to their development
levels, as their capacities can vary substantially and adjust activities according to abilities.

Annex 8 – UNICEF Scale-up Framework and
development
The UNICEF Scale-up Framework was developed (see below) during the inception phase
and tested in the evaluation fieldwork. The final refined version is shown below
THE UNICEF SCALE-UP FRAMEWORK
What does UNICEF need to have achieved by the end of the modelling process to be ready to take a model to scale?
1. Produced an optimised and simplified program model, through co-production with children, parents and
relevant stakeholders, which is ready for scale-up …
With the following components, which have been tested and finalised through piloting:
• An equity-based theory of change
• A specification of the intended beneficiaries and of outcomes, formulated as child rights realisation, and
with clarity about whether the aim is reaching the most vulnerable children or reaching all eligible children
• Processes for identification, referral and assessment of children and families
• A specification of programme content, activities, delivery processes and preparation of staff involved, with
training materials, guidance, protocols and other resources
• A specification of core components, fidelity criteria, and scope for adaptation
• A system for monitoring delivery, quality and outcomes including in equity and rights-based terms
• An assessment of the costs of delivery of the scale-up version
2. … for which there is rigorous and persuasive evidence …
About:
• What it takes to implement it – in settings consistent with the intended scale up settings and under
routine operating conditions
• Effectiveness: in line with equity and child rights ambitions, and based on a program version and
populations consistent with scale-up intentions
• Cost effectiveness and/or cost-benefit analysis
3. … and which is perceived by policy makers, funders, delivery organisations, families, communities and
influencers …
As:
• Relevant and addressing a high priority equity-based need
• Credible
• Having relative advantage over other options and visible benefits
• Acceptable, appropriate, feasible and a good fit with:
o policy, finance, legislation, regulation
o professional paradigms and ways of working
o capacity of delivery organisations and staff
o community cultures and preferences
4. … and for which commitment has been secured
From:
• policy makers, funders, delivery organisations and practice influencers (including social and professional
associations), and UNICEF itself
To investing in and supporting:
• An agreed target for scale: whether focusing on the most vulnerable children or all eligible children
• An agreed pathway for moving to scale and planned set of actions to prepare the system for this. The
pathway may for example be institutionalisation through policy, regulation, financing; replication managed
by UNICEF; replication managed by an intermediary; or other approach to incorporation into an existing
system
• Required policy, legislative or regulatory change
• Funding made available for the scale up process and for sustained delivery at scale
• Required capacity building of delivery organisations and teams
• Development of intersectoral cooperation

UNICEF Scale-up Framework and OECD/DAC criteria
As the table below shows, the UNICEF Scale-up Framework and the OECD/DAC criteria are
highly compatible when applied to models, which is the intended target or focus of the
Scale-up Framework (rather than the focus being the process of modelling).

Search strategy
The search for literature on frameworks and methods for scaling-up interventions was
guided by the following research question:
What frameworks and models exist to guide the process of scaling-up evidence-based
interventions?
The search strategy involved:
1. Identification of previous key systematic reviews on area of interest
2. Database searches for gaps in information covered in the identified review
1. Identification of systematic review
162 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
Using the PubMed database, one key systematic review was identified on frameworks and
models for scaling-up interventions (Milat et al., 2015). This systematic review described a
rigorous search strategy, and covered seven frameworks to scale-up health interventions
from January 1990 to December 2013. Additional searches targeted:
a. Frameworks and tools to scale-up non-health related interventions published
before December 2013
b. Frameworks to scale-up all types of interventions after December 2013
2. Additional database searches
The University of Melbourne’s “Discovery” search was used, as it consolidates results from
multiple databases, to identify literature on frameworks and models not covered in the
review by Milat and colleagues. The following search terms were combined with Boolean
operators for search a and search b:
(scale-up OR "scale up" OR "scale out" OR scale-out OR scaling OR scalability OR scalable)
AND (framework* OR model*) AND intervention*
In addition to the search terms, filters were applied to specify the results by date according
to the target of the search.
The searches yielded 19 additional results.
Search results
In total, 26 frameworks and models were used to guide the scaling-up process. The
majority were specific to health interventions, but four related to educational
interventions and one related to developmental aid. Most of these models and
frameworks were developed using a literature review.
Final included literature
The CEI team then reviewed the 26 frameworks and models more closely to assess their
relevance and suitability for UNICEF and the exemplar programs. Sixteen were excluded on
the basis that they were 1) not clearly evidence-based; 2) not comprehensive; and/or 3)
focused on an out of scope policy or practice area. Ultimately, 10 frameworks and models
(see table below) were selected to guide the creation of a new framework for scale-up.
Framework development
The frameworks and models selected highlight:
• Different types of scale-up: for example, Aarons et al (2017)140 distinguish between scaling
the new delivery systems, new populations or both. WHO (2010)141 distinguishes between
vertical scale-up (changes to policy, political, legal, regulatory, budgetary or other systems
changes need to institutionalise an innovation through embedding institutionally) and
horizontal scale-up (replication of the innovation in different geographic sites, or extension
to larger or different population groups)
• The elements or components of a program required for scale-up or other aspects of
program infrastructure: for example, a theory of change or fidelity criteria
• The standards of evidence that need to have been met: particularly being able to
demonstrate that the program achieves its intended impacts
• The wider determinants of scale-up: contextual barriers and facilitators within
organisations and in the wider eco-system encountered in scale-up efforts that make it
more or less likely that efforts to scale-up will be successful. These are multiple and include
for example whether the program addresses a priority need; confidence in the viability of
140 Aarons, G.A., Sklar, M., Mustanski, B., Benbow, N. & Brown, H.B. (2017) “Scaling-out” evidence-based

the program; champions and advocates for the program; fit with the capacity of delivery
organisations
• The stages, processes, steps and activities involved in effective scale-up. These are
effectively an alternative perspective on determinants. They set out authors’
recommendations for steps and activities to address barriers and enablers, and in some
frameworks are set out as phases or sequences of activity
• Wider considerations and ways of working. Here authors share learning, from published
literature and/or practical experience, of key issues to attend to.
The frameworks were assessed to consider whether one met the requirements for this
project alone and could be applied, in practice, to the four assessments set out above. The
conclusion was that none of the frameworks provided a sufficiently comprehensive
compilation of key items that could be operationalised in this project. A particular
challenge was the diverse perspectives and time-points in which the frameworks were,
implicitly or explicitly, anchored. Several frameworks for example set out sequential steps
for future action (in the equivalent of a modelling phase) to prepare for scale-up, whereas
most of the exemplar programs have completed the modelling phase. Some frameworks
are articulated in quite abstract terms which makes it difficult to operationalise them;
others contained very specific advice which did not always appear to apply directly to the
UNICEF and Serbia context.
To develop a new composite set of criteria, first the relevance and suitability of the 26
identified frameworks was reviewed. This led to exclusion of some from the next stage on
the grounds that they were less robustly evidence-based (drawing on unspecified
literature); less comprehensive (setting out selected considerations rather than intending
to be a full account); or related to a specific policy or practice area not relevant to the
exemplar programs. This reduced the set of frameworks to 10.
The content of each of the 10 selected frameworks was mapped against a common set of
elements. The common elements were identified through a systematic scan of the content
of the frameworks and were categorized as:
• Elements relating to the components of programs (e.g. theory of change; fidelity criteria)
• Elements relating to stages and activities (e.g. test at small scale; assess fit of programme
to policy, funding and operational contexts; adapt program for scale; engage policy
context; generate evidence of effectiveness)
• Elements relating to determinants or success factors and barriers (e.g. the program
addresses a priority or relevant issue; there is persuasive evidence for the program; there
is support for the program from public system leaders)
This highlighted in particular a high degree of overlap between elements relating to stages
and activities and those relating to determinants, as the former were often ways of
addressing or creating the latter. Reviewing the different perspectives taken by the 10
frameworks, we concluded that our perspective needs to be: What does UNICEF need to
have achieved by the end of the modelling process to be ready to take a program to scale?
Taking this perspective would directly orient our framework to the evaluation questions
and to the assessments they involve. It would mean that the framework is explicitly
grounded in and applicable to UNICEF’s modelling, and could be applied flexibly both to
programs where modelling is considered complete, and to programs where modelling is
viewed as ongoing. It would also orient our appraisal to whether the necessary progress
has been achieved through modelling (and if so how) rather than specifying a required set
of actions to achieve it. This was important since the review of frameworks highlighted that
the viable approaches by which a program becomes ready to scale are multiple and
context specific. For example, the framework specifies that a program needs to be viewed
as addressing a high priority equity-based need, but it recognises that this may have come
about either because the program addresses an issue seen from the start as a high priority
need, or alternatively that this was only achieved through extensive advocacy by UNICEF
and partners.

Qualitative interviews
Sampling and recruitment
UNICEF model teams provided a list of stakeholders who were most appropriate and
relevant to invite to participate in an interview. The sample and participant information is
outlined below in Figure 1. A letter from UNICEF, an information sheet about the
evaluation and a document outlining arrangements for confidentiality and anonymity (all
in both Serbian and English) were emailed by SeConS to each participant with an invitation
to participate. Several responded immediately by telephone or email; in other cases
SeConS followed up by email and telephone to invite participation and, where agreed, to
schedule an interview.
Interview protocol
Interviews were conducted by telephone or virtual platform (Zoom) to COVID-19. The
interview was semi-structured; interviewers had guides with a series of questions
regarding the participant’s experiences of the programme and their views about strategies
and feasibility for rolling out more widely in Serbia, however the general content and flow
of conversation was adapted to the interviewee’s experience and perspective. Interviews
lasted between 60-90 minutes and were recorded for intelligent verbatim transcription.

Interview guide for local implementation partners: FAMILY OUTREACH
WORKER
This is the interview schedule for representatives of organisations that have been sites for
local implementation, such as representatives from:
• Residential centres
• Centres for Social Work
Some of the evaluation participants will have worked closely with UNICEF in the
development and modelling of FOW, others will not have done.
Some interviews will need to cover more than one of the exemplar programs. We will
cover FOW as the main program and then briefly review key points in relation to other/s.
Key background:
• FOW provides intensive family support where there is a child with complex needs, to
improve families’ capacity and reduce use of institutional care
• FOW was implemented by residential institutions in four cities, working with Centres
for Social Work
• RISP provided training (and supervision?)
• UNICEF proposal for scale-up is that residential institutions are re-purposed into new
Child & Family Centres – standards would need to be developed
• Legislative amendments were drafted but have not been implemented
• Scale-up would also require training (by RISP) and improve inter-sectoral support to
provide holistic services
• Implementation continues in Novi Sad
KEY OBJECTIVES:
• To understand how implementable FOW is from the perspective of local
implementation partners
• To understand what was/is involved in implementation
• To identify barriers and facilitators to implementation and factors that will affect the
viability of scale-up
• To understand equity implications, i.e. whether and how implementation and scale-
up will advance UNICEF’s mission of addressing inequality, or whether equity would
be compromised through implementation/scale up. This is a key consideration for
UNICEF and involves e.g. gender, disability, Roma communities and rural
communities
INTRODUCTION TO THE INTERVIEW:
• Thank you very much for making time for this interview [check how long has as per
request]
• As you will have seen from the information sheet, the purpose of this evaluation is to
explore the ways in which UNICEF’s program models are developed and taken to
scale, and how UNICEF can strengthen its work to benefit children. By ‘scale’ UNICEF
mean extending the delivery and roll-out of programmes, and other work to
‘mainstream’ the programmes in Serbia’s social protection, health, education,
justice and other systems. We are interviewing UNICEF project teams, national and
provincial stakeholders, and local partners involved in delivery of the programs. We
will be carrying out around 45 interviews.
• UNICEF has commissioned CEI, working with SeConS, to undertake the evaluation
169 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
• I’d like to discuss the Family Outreach Worker/Service [check terminology with them]
with you and to ask about your experiences of delivering FOW here
• With your permission I’ll record the interview. The recording and transcriptions and
summaries will be stored securely and accessible only to the research team
• We will bring together the views and insights of everyone we interview in our report
to UNICEF. The data will be reported without attributing views to individual
participants.

workers)
1.4 Does your organisation aim to support particular vulnerable groups (e.g. girls/boys,
disabled children, Roma communities, rural communities?)
Probe which groups and how this influences the organisation’s work.
2. INVOLVEMENT IN FAMILY OUTREACH WORKER
Aim of this section: to get background context on their involvement in FOW so that we
know how to focus the rest of the interview.
2.1. I’d like to understand more about your involvement in FOW. Can you tell me when
your organisation first became involved with the program?
Probe:
• When did they start delivering FOW
• Did they have any involvement in the development of FOW prior to that (if so,
briefly what involvement did they have in FOW’s development)
• Who decided that the organisation would deliver FOW (and if relevant why)
• Can you describe the landscape of intensive family support in Serbia before the
implementation of FOW?
2.2. Is your organisation still delivering FOW?
Probe:
• Which family groups are involved? Particularly explore involvement of
disadvantaged families
• At what scale, e.g. how many families/children supported in last 12 months and
over what geographic area
• If no longer delivering, when did they stop [adapt rest of the guide to past delivery]
3. PERCEPTIONS OF THE FAMILY OUTREACH WORKER PROGRAM
Aims of this section: to get initial views of the program before exploring implementation
issues in more depth
3.1 To start, I’d like to ask about your overall experience of involvement with FOW and
whether you see it as effective and valuable. What are your views about it?
Probe
• Do they see it as effective? If so, what is this judgement based on?
170 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
• What problem do they see it as addressing [e.g. support children/ families, reduce
institutional care] and is it the right solution to that problem?
• What do they see as the main impacts of FOW for children and families
• Do families like and find the FOW helpful? What do they say about it
• Does FOW have any particular relevance or benefits for families from
disadvantaged communities? Do you know whether these families like FOW and
see it as helpful?
• Do staff like delivering FOW?
• Do you feel that FOW is clearly needed?
4. EXPERIENCES OF DELIVERING FOW
Aims of this section: This is a key section, which aims to find about how easy it is to deliver
the program, and any facilitators and barriers to delivery
4.1 To begin, can you tell me what was involved in getting ready to deliver FOW. Did it
involve any particular preparation, like training, recruitment of new staff, and did you
need any support?
Probe:
• What was involved
• If training:
o Who provided the training
o Who attended the training
o Did the training meet needs
o How could the training be improved
• If recruitment of staff:
o Which types of staff
o How easy was it to recruit them
• Did they receive any support to deliver FOW (e.g. from UNICEF, RISP or other body)
e.g. guidance documents, supporting materials, coaching, oversight
o What was provided and by whom
o Did this meet their needs
o Were there any areas where the support needed to be improved
• Is there anything else they have needed to do, to be ready to deliver FOW
o What was needed
o How easy was it to do
4.2 Has their delivery or use of FOW changed over the period that your organisation has
been delivering it (e.g. changes in the form of delivery, ease of delivery, target
families, other agencies involved)
Probe:
• How any changes came about
• Any particular implications
4.3 How easy or difficult is it to deliver FOW?
Probe:
• What is it that makes it easy/difficult as you mention?
• Is FOW complicated, e.g. with a lot of steps or people involved?
• Is FOW unusually intensive and/or holistic and does this raise any difficulties? (e.g.
resource demands, skills needed)
• Does it rely on or involve working with organisations? Eg do families need to be
connected with other support services, and are these available? Where are there
gaps?
• Is it sufficiently clear who needs to do what to deliver FOW?
171 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
• Is there anything else they have needed to do, to deliver FOW (e.g. changes to
their working processes or developing new working processes)
o What was needed
o How easy was it to do
• Is it very different from previous practices?
4.4 How well do you feel FOW fits with your organisation?
Probe:
• Does it help you to achieve your organisation’s priority aims?
• Does it fit well with the rest of the work and practices of the organisation
• Does it fit well with staff roles and skills
• Did it need to be modified, or would it ideally be modified to fit better in your
organisation?
• Were you / will you be able to modify it (e.g. are restrictions imposed by UNICEF or
anyone else)
• If modifications have been / are made, how does this affect reach and impact for
the most disadvantaged families?
4.5 How well does FOW align with the social welfare system generally, both nationally and
locally, such as regulation, funding, practice standards, professional training?

FOW that you would like to mention?
Probe:
• How they help or hinder, and what is needed to address this
4.7 Is FOW now a permanent part of your organisation’s work, or is your understanding
that it will be delivered just for a pilot or test period?
Probe:
• We understand that other sites stopped delivering FOW after the end of the
modelling period. How have you managed to continue delivery? What issues did
you need to overcome?
• In your experience of implementing it, are there any factors that will or would
make it easier to continue delivery? (E.g. characteristics of FOW, secure funding,
continued support etc)
• And are there any factors that will or would make it harder to continue delivery?
(E.g. characteristics of FOW, funding will end, support will end)
• Does your organisation have any plans to increase or decrease the scale of
delivery (e.g. the number of families who use the service, or the geographic
coverage), or change the target recipient group
5 IF PROGRAM NO LONGER BEING DELIVERED
Aims of this section: to understand how this came about and whether this leaves a gap
172 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
5.1 You said earlier that you’re no longer delivering FOW here. Can you tell me how and
why that came about?
Probe:
• Which organisation made the decision made and why
• What are your views about FOW no longer being delivered? Do you feel it ideally
should still be delivered by your organisation?
• Does not having FOW leave an unmet need? What is this and whose needs are
unmet?
• Has it made it more difficult to support the most disadvantaged children and
families?
6 VIEWS ABOUT SCALING UP FOW
Aims of this section: to ascertain views about whether and how the program should or
could be scaled-up
6.1 Overall, in your view, should FOW be rolled out more widely in Serbia?
Probe:
• Why or why not
• What are your views about how widely it could or should be rolled out (e.g. is it
feasible outside cities)
• Is it suitable for all organisations of their type e.g. residential centres, Centres for
Social Work etc or would an organisation need to have specific priorities, staff,
capacities, client groups, collaborations, aims etc for FOW to be suitable?
6.2 Do you have any views about what form rolling it out more widely should take, and
what it would involve?
Probe:
• [If not obvious] which organisations should be responsible for delivery? Eg
residential centres re-purposed as Child & Family Centres?
• Should FOW be implemented as a distinct program, or should this kind of work be
embedded in mainstream practice eg in the work of Centres for Social Work or
residential centres
• What if any wider changes would be needed to enable scale-up? Eg legislative
change -why is this necessary? Or wider staff skills development?
7 EXAMPLES OF OTHER SUCCESSFUL SCALE-UP
Aims of this section: UNICEF have asked us to explore whether stakeholders are aware of
other, non-UNICEF, programs that have been successfully scaled up that provide useful
examples of how barriers were overcome.
7.1 Are you able to share any examples of programs, not involving UNICEF, in your policy
area that have been successfully scaled-up? Can you tell us a little about how that was
achieved?
Probe:
• What form did scale-up take?
• What aided this and what barriers had to be overcome and how?
8 FINAL VIEWS
Aims of this section: To capture any final views and recommendations
8.1 What advice would you give another organisation like yours about delivering FOW?
8.2 What advice would you give to UNICEF about their work in developing and supporting
FOW?

Example topic guide- System stakeholder
Interview guide for system-level stakeholders: FAMILY OUTREACH
WORKER
This is the interview guide for national system-level stakeholders, such as representatives
from:
• Ministry of Labour, Employment, Veterans and Social Affairs
• Republic Institute for Social Protection
Most participants will have worked closely with UNICEF in the development and
modelling of FOW, others may not have done. Some interviews will need to cover more
than one of the exemplar programs. We will cover FOW as the main program and then
briefly review key points in relation to other/s.
Key background:
• FOW provides intensive family support where there is a child with complex needs, to
improve families’ capacity and reduce use of institutional care
• FOW was implemented by residential institutions in four cities, working with Centres
for Social Work
• RISP provided training (and supervision?)
• UNICEF proposal for scale-up is that residential institutions are re-purposed into new
Child & Family Centres – standards would need to be developed
• Legislative amendments were drafted but have not been implemented
• Scale-up would also require training (by RISP) and improve inter-sectoral support to
provide holistic services
• Implementation continues in Novi Sad
KEY OBJECTIVES:
• To understand whether key stakeholders agree with and share UNICEF’s vision for
FOW, and have committed to supporting scale-up
• To understand barriers and facilitators to scale-up, and the work that would be
required for scale up to be achieved
• To understand whether scale-up is viable for FOW, the form this should take, and if
not whether UNICEF can advance their ambitions to reduce institutional care for
children with complex needs in any other way (whether with the program and
stakeholder or not)
• To understand equity implications, ie whether and how scale-up will advance
UNICEF’s mission of addressing inequality, or whether this would be compromised by
scale-up. This is a key consideration for UNICEF and involves eg gender, disability,
Roma communities and rural communities
INTRODUCTION TO THE INTERVIEW:
• Thank you very much for making time for this interview [check how long has as per
request]
• As you will have seen from the information sheet, the purpose of this evaluation is to
explore the ways in which UNICEF’s program models are developed and taken to
scale, and how UNICEF can strengthen its work to benefit children. By ‘scale’ UNICEF
mean extending the delivery and roll-out of programmes, and other work to
‘mainstream’ the programmes in Serbia’s social protection, health, education,
justice and other systems. We are interviewing UNICEF project teams, national and
provincial stakeholders, and local partners involved in delivery of the programs. We
will be carrying out around 45 interviews.
174 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
• UNICEF has commissioned CEI, working with SeConS, to undertake the evaluation
• I’d like to discuss the Family Outreach Worker [check whether refer to it as this or
Family Outreach Service] program with you and to ask your views about it, whether it
should be scaled up, and what this would involve.
• With your permission I’ll record the interview. The recording and transcriptions and
summaries will be stored securely and accessible only to the research team
• We will bring together the views and insights of everyone we interview in our report
to UNICEF. The data will be reported without attributing views to individual
participants.
5. BACKGROUND
Aim of this section: to understand the priorities of the organisation so we have background
context on how the UNICEF program fit
1.5 Can you start by telling me what your role is in (insert name of organisation) and how
long have you been with the organisation?
1.6 [If needed and appropriate brief background on the organisation]
6. INVOLVEMENT IN THE FAMILY OUTREACH WORKER PROGRAM
Aim of this section: to get background context on their involvement in the FOW program so
that we know how to focus the rest of the interview. Also to understand whether partners
who UNICEF describe as very centrally involved actually share that perspective.
6.1. I’d like to cover your involvement in the Family Outreach Worker program in this
interview. Can you tell me how you or your organisation became involved and when?
And what kind of roles did you play?
Probe:
• Why they became involved (eg link with their strategic objectives)
• Who initiated the project. If their organisation initiated it, why? If others, how was
that idea received by their organisation? How did UNICEF and other stakeholders
including donors fit in?
• How was it seen as fitting with the priorities of their organisation? Were there any
concerns?
• What was the situation in relation to intensive family support as an alternative to
institutional care before the program was initiated? Was there a recognised need
for change?
2.3 Can you tell me a bit about your experience of working with UNICEF and other
partners on the design, development and testing of the FOW program. How well do
you feel the collaborative work has gone?
Probe:
• Were they collaborators from the start
• If so, what was their contribution to the design of FOW. Who was involved from
their organisation and how did the design process go
• If not involved from the start, when and how were they involved
• How did they work with UNICEF and other partners
• Was your organisation able to access the capacity and resources it needed
• Did you have enough support from UNICEF and other partners? Were there any
gaps?
• How strong do you feel the collaboration was
6.2. Is your organisation still involved with the FOW? Can you tell me more about the
current work you’re your organisation is doing?
Probe:
• Nature of their involvement now
175 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
• Their understanding of the current status of FOW, eg on hold, still being
implemented, being developed further, have already been scaled up. [Our
understanding is that it is on hold except in Novi Sad]
7. PERCEPTIONS OF FOW
Aims of this section: For FOW to be scalable, key stakeholders need to support it and see it
as effective, necessary, a good fit with the system, and the right way forward. This section
assesses that, and provides context to understanding what scale up would involve
3.2 I’d like to ask about your views of FOW – whether you see it as effective and valuable.
What are your views about it?
Probe – and in each case explore why / why not
• Do they see it as effective? If so, what is this judgement based on? Have they seen
sufficient evidence of effectiveness and this sufficiently robust? [eg RISP delivery
evaluation; University of Belgrade evaluation; summative evaluation by
PluriConsult: these didn’t show definitively a reduction in use of institutional care]
• Is FOW clearly needed? Does it clearly add value?
• Does it fit with national strategic priorities?
• Does it fit with their organisation’s priorities and help to advance their strategic
priorities?
• Is it a good fit with the sector, can it be implemented? What are the obstacles to
effective implementation?
8. VIEWS ABOUT SCALE-UP
Aims of this section: This section is key to understanding whether they would support scale-
up of FOW, what this would involve, and the barriers and facilitators to scaling up. If their
organisation is central to scale-up, are they committed to whatever action from them it
would require?
8.3 As you know, UNICEF’s aim is to scale-up their effective programs. In your opinion,
should FOW be scaled up?
Probe:
• If so, why?
• Would scaling up FOW particularly support disadvantaged communities e.g.
girls/boys, disabled children, Roma communities, rural communities?
• How should FOW be scaled up
• Which organisations would deliver and support scaled-up delivery of FOW [NOTE
THAT UNICEF VIEW IS FOR RESIDENTIAL CENTRES TO BE REPURPOSED AS NEW
CHILD & FAMILY CENTRES]
• What scale is needed (e.g. nationwide provision, gradual roll-out, wider but still
selective provision)
• Would it be feasible for FOW to be rolled out in rural communities? What form
should this take [e.g. locally based workers attached to new central Child & Family
Centres]
• The aim of FOW is build families’ capacity to care for children with complex need,
and avoid institutional care. Is the best way of achieving this at scale to implement
FOW as a distinct program, or should this kind of work be embedded in
mainstream practice e.g. in the work of Centres for Social Work or other
professional groups?
• If not, why not? (E.g. FOW many not be seen as adding value, effective, a priority,
implementable)
8.4 What is needed to scale the program up?
Prompt on the following exploring whether necessary and why:
• Changes to legislation or regulation needed: We understand from UNICEF that
regulatory changes have been drafted but not adopted. Are they needed for scale-
176 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
up? Are there any particular reasons why they have not yet been adopted? What
would be needed to take this forward?
• Wider policy change eg strengthening of inter-sectoral cooperation
• Changes within sectors, eg additional staff capacity, additional workforce skills,
more services – eg more extensive services for FOW to draw on
• Does FOW involve an approach or philosophy that is very culturally different from
current practice and philosophies (eg about the role/expertise or parents, role of
institutional care, child rights to inclusion)? If so is other work needed alongside
FOW to change culture or public views?
• New or reconfigured organisations or services – eg residential centres repurposed
as new Child & Family Centres
• Further development or adaptation of FOW
8.5 What would it take to make the necessary changes?
Probe:
• What commitments or decisions are needed by their organisation / others
• What further work is needed by UNICEF / others (eg further program
development, better evidence, advocacy and comms)
• What barriers stand in the way (eg lack of commitment, lack of priority, lack of
evidence, lack of popular demand)
• What is needed to address those barriers
8.6 What about the finances involved. If FOW was operating at scale, how would it need to
be funded?
Probe:
• If funding is needed for initial push to scale-up: what funding streams could be
used
• Would FPW be self-funding through savings to institutional care?
• If funding is needed permanently for scaled-up delivery: what funding streams
could be used
• Have they seen sufficiently robust cost analysis? Is more work needed here?
9 EXAMPLES OF OTHER SUCCESSFUL SCALE-UP
Aims of this section: UNICEF have asked us to explore whether stakeholders are aware of
other, non-UNICEF, programs that have been successfully scaled up that provide useful
examples of how barriers were overcome.
9.1 Are you able to share any examples of programs, not involving UNICEF, in your policy
area that have been successfully scaled-up? Can you tell us how it was achieved?
Probe:
• What form did scale-up take?
• What aided this and what barriers had to be overcome and how?
10 OVERALL VIABILITY AND READINESS FOR SCALE-UP
Aims of this section: To capture any final views and recommendations
Overall, how likely do you think it is that the challenges you’ve described in relation to
scaling up FOW can be addressed?
10.1 If they can’t be addressed, and FOW can’t feasibly be scaled up, are there other ways
that UNICEF could advance the aims that the program was designed to address? Ie to
build family capacity to care for children with complex needs and reduce institutional
care
For example through wider policy change, practice change or service provision rather
than specifically scaling up FOW
10.2 What advice do you have for UNICEF about how they approach modelling and scale-
up, and how they should take forward FOW?

Qualitative analysis
A thematic analysis was undertaken of the qualitative data. Thematic analysis is a
foundational method for qualitative analysis, and involves identifying key themes,
categorising data within them, and identifying, analysing and reporting patterns within the
dataset142. Our approach was theoretically-driven and deductive, reflecting the research
questions and UNICEF Scale-up Framework.
Interviews undertaken in Serbian and English were transcribed, and summary analysis
undertaken in English. Where applicable, illustrative quotes were provided in English as
part of summary analysis. The approach was largely semantic, working with the explicit or
surface meanings of data; tacit meanings had been discussed in interviews.
Thematic analysis was undertaken using the Framework method143, 144. A set of themes and
codes was developed, the evaluation questions and the key themes within the data. These
were applied to data summaries using the software Dedoose, which enables easy
searching so that the full context of an interview can be reviewed, and data within each
code can be collated and reviewed.
Thematic analysis using these methodologies allowed both within group comparison (for
example, reviewing the diversity of views among systems stakeholders) and between
group comparison (for example, comparing views about the determinants of effective
scale-up expressed by UNICEF teams with those expressed by system stakeholders).
Quantitative survey for implementation sites
A brief online survey was developed using Qualtrics to capture the experience of those
either implementing or with previous experience with the models who were not
interviewed. This was based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research
(see chapter 3 of the report), with selection and adaptation of recommended CFIR.
Sampling procedure for survey
The focus of the survey was on local implementation sites and current delivery of the
models. UNICEF model teams provided an additional list of stakeholders that were to be
contacted with a copy of the survey. It would not have been appropriate to invite
qualitative interviews to participate in the survey as it covered information already given.
This meant that there was no coverage of FOW implementation sites (since none are
currently delivering except in Novi Sad), and very little of IFC implementation sites (since
no new families are being taken on except in Novi Sad), Recipients also had the option of
circulating the survey among their colleagues. The survey was sent to 82 individuals.
Survey participation
The survey was sent as part of an email, which had a URL code in which participants could
access, which enabled forwarding to additional personnel. The invitation and survey was
exclusively in Serbian, and correspondence was managed by the team at SeConS, with
additional prompts on occasion provided by UNICEF staff. The survey was sent with a letter
from UNICEF, information sheet and further information about confidentiality and

anonymity. A reminder email was sent after 7 days. Very few responses were received
indicating experience of Diversionary Measures, despite around 20 contact details having
been given by UNICEF, and the UNICEF team sent a direct approach to these individuals to
encourage participation. Participation remained low. After 14 days, the survey link was
closed for analysis.
A total of 39 individuals completed the survey in full. 33 of the 39 provided details of their
role and organisation. An overwhelming majority of participation came from DOP and ECI
models, which reflected the high rates of school staff/educators completing the survey.

Survey tool
The Centre for Evidence and Implementation, working with SeConS Development
Initiative Group, has been commissioned by UNICEF in Serbia to undertake an
evaluation of five UNICEF early childhood programs. This survey focuses on the
experiences and views of staff in organisations that are involved in any of the five
UNICEF programs.
We want to hear what you think about the interventions and whether they help children and families
in Serbia. Your input will help UNICEF to make decisions about how it develops these and other
programs for the future.
The five UNICEF programs are listed below. They may be known by different names in your
organisation, so we have provided a brief description. Your organisation may be involved in only part
of the program, or you may no longer be involved in any of the programs but your views are still very
helpful. The first question in the survey asks you which program you are (or were) involved in, or
which you are (or were) most involved in.
• Drop-out prevention
Schools’ work to prevent children from dropping out of school, which involves identifying children at
risk, supporting children and families to stay engaged, and developing whole-school approaches.
• Early Childhood Intervention
Multi-disciplinary teams working with families with children with developmental delays and
disabilities to support their involvement in family and community life. The program involves
outreach, screening, developing an Individual family support plan and weekly visits with the family.
• Intermittent Foster Care
Providing respite fostering care for children with disabilities, often by other family members.
• Diversionary Measures
Orders for alternative sanctions or restorative approaches for juvenile offenders. The intervention
involves assessing the suitability of diversionary measures, making the order, and providing
diversionary activity.
• Family Outreach Worker
An intensive family support service, where a practitioner works directly with families over 8-12
months providing support, advice and community coordination and care.
This survey should take around 10-15 minutes to complete. The data will be confidential and results
will be reported without naming individual organisations or people.
Please [press the consent button] if you consent to take part in the survey.

УНИЦЕФ у Србији је ангажовао Центар за евиденцију и имплементацију да у
сарадњи са Секонс групом за развојну иницијативу спроведе евалуацију пет
УНИЦЕФ-ових програма усмерених на подршку у раном развоју. Ово
истраживање фокусира се на искуства и ставове запослених у
организацијама/институцијама које су укључене у било који од пет УНИЦЕФ-ових програма.
Желимо да чујемо шта мислите о интервенцијама и да ли помажу деци и породицама у Србији.
Ваш допринос ће помоћи УНИЦЕФ-у да доноси одлуке о томе како да развија ове и друге
програме у будућности.
У наставку је наведено пет УНИЦЕФ-ових програма који су обухваћени евалуацијом. Могуће је
да су познати под различитим називима у Вашој организацији/институцији, па смо пружили
кратак опис сваког програма. Поред тога, могуће је да је Ваша организација укључена у само
један део програма или да више уопште није укључена у реализацију програма, али Ваше
мишљење је и даље од великог значаја. Прво питање у анкети односи се на то у који сте
програм укључени тренутно (или у који програм сте били укључени). У случају да сте укључени
у више програма, питања у упитнику односе се на програм у који сте у највећој мери укључени
(или у који сте били највише укључени).

191 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
Annex 12 – Ethical considerations
Alignment with UNEG norms and standards
The project was undertaken in alignment with UNEG norms and standards. There was a
clear purpose in conducting the work and it is intended that the resulting analysis and
recommendations will support UNICEF’s ongoing work to ensure equitable access to
evidence-informed programs for all children including those most vulnerable through
successful modelling and scale-up. The methodology was developed to be rigorous and
transparent, involving qualitative and quantitative approaches, documentary analysis, and
a variety of stakeholders to reflect different perspectives and allow triangulation. The
evaluation team involved skilled professional evaluators with both local and international
expertise. Evaluators were sensitive to beliefs, manners and custos and acted with
integrity and honesty, ensuring contacts with participants were characterised by respect.
In designing and undertaking the evaluation, the team recognised their obligations with
regard to independence, impartiality, credibility, conflicts of interest and accountability.
The evaluation team prepared thoroughly for fieldwork, ensuring that the information to
be given to participants, purpose and intent of questions, and the scope for adaption to
individual participants’ contexts were clearly and consistently understood. Questions were
addressed in a non-judgmental and open-ended way to encourage discussion and inclusive
participation.
Human rights, gender and equality
A human rights-based, gender and equality sensitive approach was taken throughout, in
line with UNEG ethical guidelines and the UNICEF evaluation policy. This involved:
• All team members being familiar with relevant approaches and guidance
• Inclusion of questioning to address rights- and equity-based considerations in key
informant interviews
• Mainly use of qualitative methodologies which can be flexed to equity
considerations and to be inclusive, gender and trauma sensitive
• Sampling which is gender sensitive and inclusive of organisations working with
disadvantaged communities and populations
• Clear and culturally appropriate information about the evaluation that outlines
the context and the voluntary nature, with clear options for withdrawal
• Interviews undertaken in Serbian as necessary and by experienced researchers
able to encourage equal and active participation
• Data disaggregated in analysis to explore equity-based considerations and
outcomes, with particular emphasis on findings relating to rights, gender and
equity-based considerations for scale-up
Ethical conduct
The evaluation team worked to the ethical principles for evaluation as outlined in the
UNEG Norms and Standards for Evaluation and in the the UNICEF Procedure for Ethical
Standards in Research, Evaluation, Data Collection and Analysis throughout all stages of
the evaluation process. This involved:
• There were no conflicts of interest between evaluation team members (or their
respective organisations) and the objectives of the evaluation or the evaluation
subject
• Non-maleficence (‘Do No Harm’)- the evaluation team designed the evaluation
data collection to avoid harmful, inappropriate, and irrelevant techniques and
192 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
procedures. Members of the evaluation team were appropriately skilled and
experienced to conduct the evaluation.
• Respectfully acknowledging and supporting voice, dignity and agency of
evaluation participants
• Respectful and culturally appropriate interactions with all stakeholders and
participants in the evaluation process, particularly those from vulnerable groups
or working with vulnerable groups
• Provision of written and verbal information regarding the project context,
purpose and the voluntary nature of participation to all evaluation participants.
o Those approached to be interviewed received a letter from UNICEF
Country Office and information sheet about the evaluation, and a
document signed by leaders at CEI and SeConS setting out how
confidentiality and anonymity would be managed and data security
maintained
o Verbal consent was given for interviews (which were conducted by
telephone or e-platform without physical meetings with participants),
and confirmation of consent was given as part of the online survey
process
• Findings have been reported accurately and impartially, with collaboration and
quality assurance within and beyond the evaluation team to avoid bias or
inaccuracy
• Care was taken throughout to avoid attributing comments to identified
individuals or organisations.
• Formal ethics review was not required as the evaluation did not involve collection
of data from service users/recipients, rights holders or children and young people
Data management
The safety and confidentiality of all data collected was secured through following
systematic data management approaches. The principles of good data management
followed include the avoidance of data waste; clear justifications of data collection; data
specification; secure data storage in line with data protection requirements; database
maintenance; ongoing data audit as part of research; and the secure archiving or
destruction of data.
Ethics review requirements
Based on the UNICEF criteria for ethical review checklist, formal ethics review was not
required as the evaluation did not involve collection of data from service users/recipients,
rights holders or notably children or young people.

It is not clear, from documentation of the SQN, whether the list represents what needs to
be carried out before modelling can begin (there is a reference to the SQN as ‘pre-
conditions for modelling’) or whether it represents what needs to be achieved by the end
of modelling, or what is required for a model to be ready for scale-up. Key issues missing
from it include:
• The model itself, which needs to have been developed through collaboration and
to evidence- or theoretically-informed, with all the necessary components and
resources prepared, either ready to be piloted or having been optimised following
modelling
• Partnerships for modelling or for scale-up
• Analysis of implementation barriers and enablers and strategies to address,
evaluation of implementation effectiveness
• Agreed end game and pathway for modelling
• Wider support for ambitions of model, or activity to secure it (needs to be wider
than ‘disseminate results’)
195 Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020
Annex 14 – Other scaled-up initiatives
One of the evaluation questions asks for examples of initiatives that have been scaled-up
or replication in Serbia, that might warrant further investigation, outside the scope of this
evaluation, of the barriers and enablers of scale-up and that pathways and activities
involved. The interviewees were often not able to name any such initiative, and where
they were able to they often had little knowledge of what had been involved in scaling-up.
The initiatives suggested are:
• deinstitutionalisation of out of family care, expansion and improvement of foster
care and improvement of foster care support
• support for children with disabilities including day care, home assistance and
supported housing
• pre-school education and care
• free legal aid
• development of emergency responses
