Scope and criteria of evaluation
Scope of the evaluation
âª thematic scope: summative evaluation covers all the activities implemented through
This project covering three school years (2015-2016, 2016-2017 and 2017-2018) and the evaluation
final covers the interventions on the components of social protection measures carried out
to achieve results 2 and 3;
âª Geographical range: information collection focuses on a school of schools, with
A surgery of schools where the 1,000 primary classes have benefited from a
Accelere Support4! in the provinces of Ecuador, Haut-Katanga, Tanganyika and Lualaba;
âª Chronological scope: the final evaluation covers all the activities implemented through this
Project since its start-up in the 2015-2016 school year and up to its fence in 2017-2018.
Evaluation criteria
The evaluation methodology refers to the criteria of the Development Aid Committee of
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (CAD-OCDE): relevance,
Efficiency, efficiency, sustainability, to which the customer has added the equity and gender criterion.
Methodology
Evaluation approach
This evaluation uses a "results cartography" approach based on theory
change that provides a framework to collect data on immediate changes and
fundamentals leading to longer and more transformative changes, which allows
The assessment of the contribution of the initiative to the sought -after results. She has a collection of
empirical data from the various protagonists and project documents, and research
statistical information in the various regulatory school registers, and includes:
âª a partner part in order to measure and account for the results achieved by the project since
its start to its fence;
âª a learning part relating to the schooling of vulnerable children and passing through
The approach scale, by addressing future users of the evaluation.
The evaluation includes 3 modalities:
âª a documentary study on the various documents generated by managers of
the initiative of the project, by the services and institutions that supported and implemented it, and by
the actors of the project itself;
âª Targeted interviews with a sampling of key players, partners and beneficiaries of
project ;
âª In the field, a phase of collection of qualitative and quantitative data in schools
beneficiaries relating to a sample of 75 schools.
15 SOFRECO-PERSPECTIVE
Revised report
Sampling strategy
The budget allocated to the field survey forced to limit the size of the sample to 75 schools to
Visit (21 in Ecuador and 54 in Katanga, according to the old names of the provinces).
The sample of schools supported by Accelere4! could not be made up
representative taking into account precise data on the educational structure of the school and on
internal efficiency indicators, as these data are not presented in any of the
Recent statistical directories from MEPST (2014 and 2018). Also we carried out the
Constitution of a non -probabilistic but reasoned sample.
Methods and tools
To collect quantitative and qualitative data from the evaluation, we use different tools:
âª a documentary review of the administrative texts on which the project was based for its
design, studies and information on which he founded his objectives, prerequisites and
logical framework in order to assess its relevance;
âª Individual interviews with key informants and project managers;
âª The collection of information of a quantitative nature on the regulatory documents of schools
(bearing information on absenteeism, success and abandonment) and the activity reports of
Directors;
âª Focus groups with direct and secondary beneficiaries.
Analysis and quality assurance
Quantitative and qualitative data will be harvested via a field survey, at the levels
central and regional, and in the schools of the survey sample.
The data are then analyzed and classified by criterion to answer the various questions
evaluation.
Data collection will be made at the level of several sources to allow the implementation
of a triangulation strategy in order to draw reliable conclusions for each evaluation issue.
The means and methods implemented by the evaluation team are supposed to guarantee validity and
credibility of the responses, and quality insurance is carried out at the following steps:
Design of methodology and tools, collection, processing and analysis of data.
Evaluation process
The evaluation is done on 3 levels, national, provincial and schools, with a double qualitative approach
and quantitative.
Consultants begin with a documentary study and analysis of the project data in the
national level supplemented by interviews and group discussions with the parties
taking. In a second step, this approach is replicated at the level of the chief towns of

INTRODUCTION
2 Introduction
According to the 2019 human development report published by the United Nations program
For development (UNDP) 2, out of 189 countries identified, the DRC occupies the 179th position in the world
With a 0.459 Human Development Index (HDI).
According to the national survey on the situation of children and adolescents outside the school3, education
School remains out of reach for nearly 7 million children aged 5 to 17. Instability
politics and natural disasters prevented the DRC from reaching primary education
universal for children. In addition, the main financial costs of direct and indirect expenses
Linked to supporting a child's education are the responsibility of parents. In this context, the
children's vulnerability is a complex and uncertain social phenomenon, shaped by the interaction of
economic, social and cultural factors and which manifest themselves both at the individual level and
Community. The concept of this vulnerability has two aspects: on the one hand, it contains a
Concept of children's exposure to economic and social risks detrimental to their well-being
And on the other hand it refers to a notion of their weakness to face these risks. The enunciation
of the rights of the child as they are established in the International Convention on the Rights of the Child
(CIDE) 4 constitutes the most complete and legitimate codification of this well-being understood as law
for the child to live in material conditions necessary for his physical development,
mental, spiritual, moral and social. The right to education is clearly exposed and detailed in this
statement.
Despite its ratification to the CIDE (09/27/1990), the DRC has little protection measures
vulnerable children, especially for access to education, the total free of which is not
effective, and this throughout the country, leaving the project initiative to partnership
Help in schooling, limited in space and time.

3 context of the evaluation
3.1 Sociogeographic context of the project
Key sub-sectors of the Congolese education system, preschool education and teaching
primary are under the supervision of the Ministry of Primary, Secondary and Technical Education
(MEPST), formerly Ministry of Primary, Secondary and Professional Education
(MEPSP), while the Ministry of Social Affairs (Mas) takes care of literacy and
Non -formal education.
The DRC is one of the African countries with a very large number of children outside the school5.
The survey carried out in 2012 by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) thanks to the
financing of the Department for International Development (DFID), now merged with Foreign
and Commonwealth Office (FCO) under the name of Foreign Commonwealth & Development Office
(FCDO), on these children and adolescents outside the school (EADE) revealed that they were in
DRC nearly 7.4 million aged 5-17, almost 30% of this age group. Among these 7.4
Millions of EADE, it was counted 2,144,194 for 5 years (78.8 % of the 5 -year -old population) and 3.5
million aged between 6 and 11 years (26.7% of the population of 6-11 year olds). It is in this age group
of compulsory schooling (6-11 years) that the proportion of eads was the highest, 47.6 %.
About 30% of these 6-11 year old children outside the school found themselves in the two provinces
What are the ex-Katanga (current Haut-Katanga, Haut-Lomami, Lualaba and Tanganyika) and the current
Province of Ecuador.
This survey also revealed that 2.1 million children aged 6 and 7 did not start
School at the legal age, that is to say at 6 years old. This observation applies almost tied for girls and
boys. Thus 20.5% of children enrolled in primary school have a delay of 1 year and 32% a delay of 2
years and more 6.
It is also necessary to add the discrimination linked to gender and physical appearance,
especially people living with disability, as well as ethnic minorities, children
Affected by the Pandemic of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), the children on the street as well
that children who live in precariousness.

Vulnerable children in the provinces of Ecuador, Haut Katanga, Tanganyika and Lualaba in the DRC
Context of evaluation
In this context, girls appear even more disadvantaged because they most often
cultural prejudices, abuse and gender -related violence, especially in conflict areas, both
in the school environment than outside. All these harmful practices limit their access to
School.
The Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) of 2017-2018 of UNICEF in DRC reports
that at the age of going to primary school, 22.3 % of girls aged 5-17 are outside school, against
20.9 % of boys. Finally, more than two out of five girls are victims of sexual abuse before adulthood.
3.1.1 Tuition fees and impact of the gradual implementation of free
school
Despite the 2014 framework law in 20147 tuition fees represented the main obstacle in 2015
To access the school, despite the 2014 framework law which makes national education free in
public establishments at general primary and secondary levels. The distribution of the budget between
primary and secondary levels does not promote the effectiveness of the operationalization of the policy of
Free in terms of primary education8. In 2016, out of a total of 15.3% of state budget allocated to
General education, only 0.11% are assigned to primary education (BM, UNESCO /
CONEPT -DRC - 2017).
3.1.2 What did not represent free school free to launch the project in
2015?

3.1.3 The feeling of the free project to launch the project in 2015
In 2010, a study of the National Education Coalition for all in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo (CONEPT-DRC) and the United Nations Organization for Education, Science,
Culture and communication (UNESCO) was conducted in all provinces with:
âª primary teachers;
âª School directors;
âª Inspectors;
âª Resource people: provincial, secondary and secondary and
Technique (EPST) notably the head of the provincial division of EPST (Proved) and
the main provincial inspector (PPI), managers of approved schools,
managers of statistical services and school infrastructure.
It emerged that almost 70% of participants estimated that total gratuity would endanger the
quality of teaching by a strong increase in enrollment, just as it would seriously harm
the pressing material needs of teachers. In addition, the reception tolerated in certain schools
students who have not paid tuition fees was very badly felt by all participants
Who considered it abnormal to finance the education of other children than their own. Furthermore, a
Free welcome for some students was experienced as a form of demotivation of teachers,
having negative repercussions on the quality of teaching.
3.1.4 The free situation in 2015 at the launch of the project in 2015
âª The teacher control and payroll service (Secope) informed that in 2015, the salary
average monthly of a primary teacher paid by the State was 80 dollars in the United States
of America (USD);
âª The study "Evaluation of the implementation of free school policy in primary school
Democratic Republic of Congo (Sofreco-unicef)-2014 "was based on various
previous studies and cited, among other things, the survey conducted by the NGO International Rescue
Committee (IRC) in 2014 on school costs requested by 486 schools in seven sub-sub
Educational divisions of five IRC provinces of intervention. The investigation separated the costs
Support to the staff of ad hoc intervention costs. It quoted average expenses of
families. For primary education: a year of schooling of a child leads to an expense
average of 61,543 Congolese francs (FC) (Â± 30 USD), including 39,971 FC (Â± 20 USD) were
Poured to schools for the different forms of school fees and intervention. Even if they are
lower than for other levels of education, primary school fees
represent an important monetary expenditure for families.
These various information stresses that when the program is launched, access to school
For the poorest was still slowed down by the remaining tuition fees, despite free
displayed.

Context of evaluation
3.2 Socioeducative context in 2015
According to the "sectoral strategy of education and training - 2016-2025" 9, teaching
primary has experienced a strong expansion of the workforce over the past decade. The cover
school has also improved: the gross schooling rate (TBS) went from less than 90% in
2007 to more than 107% in 2014. This strong expansion of the workforce could be explained, among other things,
by the implementation since 2010 of the free policy since 2010. As for gender equity, we
Observes an improvement in the parity index which went from 0.81 in 2007 to 0.91 in 2014.
3.2.1 The school population at the launch of the project in 2015
According to the MEPST, the 2014 data show a completion rate of 70% at the national level
While it was 29% in 2002. Disparities between genre are noted against girls
But also between provinces. The provinces of Kinshasa, Bandundu, Bas-Congo and Kasai
Oriental records the best completion rates of primary school, while the Eastern provinces,
from South Kivu, Ecuador and Katanga have the lowest primary completion rates.
Analysis of primary schools shows that almost 52.5 % of the number of new
incoming in the first year of primary are an official oldest (6 years old) and 11% of the workforce is
Redoublays.
High repetition rates are also one of the causes of abandonment due to the cost of a
additional year attributed to families. The average age of children entering primary school, by
Example, is 7.2 years at the national level. The analyzes carried out within the framework of the State report of the
National Educational System (RESEN) show that a significant number of children of age of being
The school, are actually outside of it. This phenomenon of non -schooling appears
particularly important in rural areas, in the provinces of North Kivu, Katanga and both
Kasai, and among the poorest families.
3.2.2 Primary school results at the launch of the project in 2015
According to the results of the 2010 education systems analysis program (PASEC)
Conference of Ministers of Education of States and Governments of the Francophonie
(Confemen), the average score of children in 5th year of primary is 39.2 in French and 45.2
in mathematics. Average scores in the same disciplines for children in the 2nd year of
primary are 55.3 and 55 respectively. Analysis of the results of this evaluation shows
also that 9.2% of children in the second year and 18% of 5th year of primary
of school failure.
Examination of the results of the Early Grade Reading Assessment and Early Grade Mathematics tests
Assessment (EGRA-EGMA) carried out in 2012 by the project to improve the quality of education
(PAQUED) shows that 47% of 4th and 23% students in 6th grade were unable to read a
The only word of the reading item after a minute. Likewise, 85.1% of 4th graders and 40.7% of students
of 6th could not answer any questions of understanding.

Regarding mathematics, 2nd year students have difficulties when the numbers

and percentages10.
3.2.3 Primary teachers at the launch of the project in 2015
Teacher's remuneration levels are among the weakest compared to neighboring countries
And other sub -Saharan African countries of similar economic level. Half of the staff
Teacher assigned to educational institutions was not paid by the State. For this reason
resulted in the "motivation bonus", a salary supplement or substitute, taken from the costs
paid by families.
Relative to their level of certification, it should be noted that the D4N and D6N,
Titles issued by educational humanities (HP) represented 93% of their workforce.
We can also note that in 2012, the assessment of teachers' skills carried out using the
4th year test of primary school (EGRA-EGMA) shows that only 50% of the sample of
teachers succeeded in reading items and only 36% in written expression items. Among the
reasons put forward to explain these results, the Resen invokes the demotivation of the body
teacher (wages, career prospects), weakness of initial vocational training,
low control of French by teachers, the irregularity of continuing education and the weakness of
educational supervision11.
3.3 The Accelere program
The problem of universal schooling in the contexts described above is hampered by
Multiple factors thus leaving many children outside the school12. Among the obstacles
Access to school education, two main ones are identified:
Economic and socio-cultural factors
âª Low application of free school measures;
âª Direct costs (school fees) too high;
âª Indirect costs too high (uniform, supplies, etc.);
âª School environment not favorable to learning;
âª Parents' level of education => ignorance of certain parents on the importance of education;
âª Socio-cultural gravity retrogrades (education of girls, etc.);
âª Low motivation (absence of reference, etc.);
âª Conflicts / wars, etc. ;
Factors specific to students' experience
âª Lack of alert mechanism to combat absenteeism;

Summary evaluation of the project to improve access to school and the quality of learning 26
Vulnerable children in the provinces of Ecuador, Haut Katanga, Tanganyika and Lualaba in the DRC
Context of evaluation
âª Low supervision/protection of children at school and poor school environment;
âª School failures linked to the low educational supervision;
âª Important distances between housing and the place of schooling.
To try to reduce these constraints the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)
And the FCDO have signed a joint five -year education program (USAID/UKAID ACCELERE)
in October 2014. This program aimed to improve fair access to school for children in
provinces of ex Katanga (current Haut-Katanga, Haut-Lomami, Lualaba and Tanganyika) and
Ecuador. Named "Accelere" (access, reading and retention) and comprising 4 components, it
operated in accordance with the ten -year education and temporary plan strategy
education of the DRC government.
The program completed the activities of the DRC supported by the global partnership for
Education (GPE, Global Partnership for Education). This partnership between USAID and FCDO reflected
the priorities of the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom to facilitate a long transition
term towards sustainable and more efficient development in the DRC, as well as to allow the
Government of the DRC to provide and finance long -term basic services to its population.
Finally, this program testified to the efforts made, by these two large bilateral donors in
DRC, to improve coordination between partners in the development and alignment of their
Congolese government's national priorities programs.
The joint program includes four main components:
âª Component / Activity 1: Improve reading, equity and empowerment in the DRC;
âª Component / Activity 2: Strengthen governance and empowerment;
âª Component / activity 3: Monitoring and evaluation of the joint education program;
âª Component 4 / Activity 4: reduction in the number of children not educated in
provinces of Katanga and Ecuador in the DRC.
This program also sought to identify the necessary adjustments of these
interventions to subsequently carry out better target targets and then
the scale and a generalization.
The program was managed on two levels:
âª At decentralized levels, the teams located in provincial offices on the ground had to
ensure technical monitoring, capacity building, quality control and
Coordination;
âª At the national level, UNICEF had to work with selected implementation partners
on the basis of their skills in various program areas in order to integrate the
annual labor planning, provide disbaggeration/
Responsibility of funds and to ensure synergies between educational interventions.
More specifically, UNICEF had to promote intersectoral convergence with the protection of
Childhood and communication for development. At the academic and community level,
UNICEF had to establish partnerships with the schooling bodies at the school level (Committee of
COPA Parents and COGES School Management Committee). As part of the USAID/UKAID program
Accelere (A!), UNICEF had to participate in guiding committees and joint workshops
as well as sharing information and resources with managers of activities 1, 2 and 3,

Component 4 of the Accelere program (Accelere4!) Is the subject of this evaluation
summative. Its objective is that by the end of 2018, the possibilities of school preparation and
primary education will be improved for 310,500 children in the Katanga provinces and
Ecuador in the DRC, and that the following results are achieved:
âª Result 1 - By the end of 2018, school preparation in terms of admissions and during the
Primary cycle will be improved for 10,500 children not educated in Katanga and Ecuador;
âª Result 2 - By the end of 2018, the possibilities of education and learning will be increased
for 300,000 children excluded and vulnerable from Katanga and Ecuador;
âª Result 3 - by the end of 2018, the ability to support specific marginalized groups
(children with disabilities and children living on the banks of the banks) in Katanga and Ecuador is
improved.

Targets represented approximately 31 and 29 % of the 6-11 year olds not-scolanted in Katanga respectively in Katanga
and in Ecuador14.
The designation criteria took into account schools where internal efficiency was low15 (
abandonment rate and high repetition rates). The financial supports were allocated to

The results expected by project activities are as follows:
âª better access to normal age education and best learning results for
girls and boys, as well as a more reactive and more responsible education system;
âª The increase in the number of girls and boys registering in focal districts;
âª Improvement of quality education and learning in districts/provinces.
Since this important project ended in 2018, it is now necessary to assess the
Results suffered by the Accelere4 component! in order to identify not only experiences to
Capitalize but also the mechanisms of sustainability of achievements. It should be noted that the
in-depth review of the implementation of the pre-prime approach contained in the program
Accelere is done in another study.
Change theory and logical framework
The Accelere project was based on a change theory based on previous evidence
of the national survey on the situation of children and adolescents outside the 2012 school. Thus,
Schooling in preschool appeared as being able to reduce the probability of loss
school later in the school career, and therefore the rate of new registered at the primary level
Without any preschool education experience is an indicator of the risk of abandonment. THE
academic delay, child labor, as well as certain family characteristics are factors
risk of abandonment. The Accelere project postulates that the activities it would implement
would lead to the desired results of better equitable access, registration in age school
normal and the maintenance of girls and boys in primary school.
Component 4 of the Accelere project does not have its own theory of change, but
Simply stipulates that the subsidy by school must be able to finance 5 distinct activities. Theory
change, the Accelere program (Annex 2 - Organizational chart of change theory
of the Accelere program) is implicitly and partially taken up by the component
Accelere4! By helping us with the logical framework, we will suggest for the Accelere4 project! a
Change theory that can be clean to it:
âª Hypothesis 1 - The creation of 100 CPP will improve primary access to normal age, success

will promote equity and parity in sensitive areas;
âª hypothesis 3 - the implementation of an early alert system for absenteeism will notify the

âª Hypothesis 4 - Tutoring activities for students in difficulty in the first 3 years of

At the end of the evaluation, this proposal may be revised in order to integrate strategic axes and
the operational activities proposed for the sustainability of the project's achievements and a
scaling.
To adjust the theory of change and the logical framework we also offer a more rereading

This evaluation is summative, in that it assesses the final results of the project, but it fits
also in a logic of learning and sustainability of achievements relating to the schooling of
vulnerable children and from approaching the approach, addressing future users of
evaluation. It has two main goals: liable and learning.
âª Thus in terms of liable it is a question of identifying the results achieved in relation to the objectives
initials that will help the government and its partners including donors but also
beneficiaries to measure the results achieved and their value. Therefore, it will also allow
define future strategies to develop and activities to be programmed to strengthen
the appropriation and sustainability of the achievements of this project and for more effective management of
measures aimed at helping the last vulnerable sustainable schooling;
âª In terms of organizational learning, this evaluation will help to inform the work of
UNICEF (Education section of the country office as well as zone offices but also the office
regional) from the lessons learned from the implementation of the project and will guide UNICEF (at
country, regional and headquarters) to better support government partners in the
definition and application of strategies (support for schools through so -called
social protection) of this type as well as to define their passage on a scale in a gradual way.

The budget allocated to the field survey forced to limit the size of the sample to 75 schools to

The sample of schools supported by Accelere4! could not be made up

Constitution of a non -probabilistic but reasoned sample.
To define the number of schools submitted to the survey in each provincial subdivision of the EPST
Within the sample of 75 schools, each sub-division has a number of schools surveyed
corresponding to its share in the total number of schools supported by the ACCELERE4 project! By
Example, if a subdivision brings together 8% of schools supported, it includes in the sample, 75
x 8% = 6 schools. Then, the choice of these 6 schools is made according to 4 criteria:
âª Urban-Rural distribution in the subdivision which must correspond to that defined at the level of
the sample;
âª In each provincial subdivision of EPST (under Proved) we do the same
distribution according to the management methods represented;
âª Access to schools within the time limits provided by the survey;
âª A certain permanence of the school's teaching team.
The sample of the 75 schools selected for the field survey is in the appendix (Annex 8 - List

Sufficient, do not design to invest in their school education. COPA representatives
explain this attitude by the use of domestic habits that place the girls in second row
Education needs:
â¢ "My daughter helped me keep my business and with the help of the project I put her in school (at 8 years old)"
(Ecuador).
8. Accelera's response in the subsidy granted to schools welcoming very children
vulnerable, and by supporting the designation of the genre in designations, is therefore perfectly
relevant.
Vulnerable students
9. Those who, having been educated during the implementation of the project, and who could be contacted,
All claim that the obstacle to their schooling was the cost of education. The supporters brought by
tutoring has enabled them to make progress in learning and improve their successes to
monthly and annual exams. The parascolary activities were very attractive and have them
convinced to frequent assiduously:
â¢ "With tutoring I did my homework better and the master was much nicer to me"
(Haut Katanga);
â¢ "It is because there was the tutoring that I did not redouble in 1st year" (Lualaba);
â¢ "I came to school because we could then play football on Saturday afternoon"
(Haut Katanga);

14. The training provided in particular that concerning the learning of the tutoring technique,
was not based on consolidated professional skills and is therefore weakly relevant
compared to the priority needs of teachers who await a strengthening of

âª PERT 4 - The measures taken to improve the quality of teaching are less relevant
compared to the needs of strengthening the professional skills of teachers including
Academic and professional training is relatively low22 (para. 13, 14 and 15).
10.1.3 Question 3: To what measure the targeting of children allowed
to reach children in need?
10.1.3.1 Trying children beneficiaries
16. To answer this question, it is necessary to specify the concept of vulnerable child used here by
UNICEF23 and which sheds light on the choice of criteria used for targeting.
"A child is said to be vulnerable when he does not benefit, for various reasons, assistance,
Food, sanitary, school, psychological necessary for its development. Various factors
are likely to make a child vulnerable; Among these, we can cite: the lack of care
emotional, the absence of appropriate family and social supervision, the economic environment and
policy, the loss of a parent or the poverty of the supervisory family. It therefore follows that children
vulnerable constitute a group difficult to identify â.
17. In addition, the basic hypothesis on which the targeting of subsidized students is founded is that the
community (COPA, directors of schools and village chiefs, under the authority of the partners
in work and representatives of UNICEF) can better identify vulnerable children and
extremely vulnerable using relevant indicators in vulnerability:
âª Is it often hit at home?
âª Parents, or substitutes, are concerned with the child in his activities, his rhythms, his
clothing, food?
22 MEPST / SSEF 2016-2025 (ch. 1.3.1. P 24) - Examination of the results of the EGRA and EGMA assessments, carried out in 2012
As part of the PAQUED project for the 2nd, 4th and 6th years of primary classes. Evaluation of skills of
teachers carried out in the same frame shows that 50% of the sample succeeds in the reading-comprehension items and
Only 36% to written expression items.

âª How and by whom is he treated at home when he is sick?

âª etc.
18. The call for candidates and the selection are made using questioning sheets to identify
and select vulnerable households (annex 4 - candidacy and selection of children
vulnerable). They resume part of the criteria of the vulnerability defined above, in
mainly focusing on the characteristics of household members who develop
negative adaptation strategies. These questioning sheets also identify students on the basis
socio-economic criteria. Coherence is very strong between the criteria that make it possible to define
A great vulnerability and those of the targeting tools used by the Accelere project. We can
Conclude a strong relevance of the project for the targeting of very vulnerable children.
10.1.3.2 Targeting seen by the various beneficiaries
Interviews with partners and directors and group focus with COPAs allow
to answer the question of the relevance of very vulnerable children's targeting: they have the tools
Allows children's targeting in need?
Information collected from MEPST officials
19. As a whole, the Focal points of the MEPST believe that in the areas targeted by the
project, the tools used to targeting beneficiaries concern the majority of
Populations of students in targeted areas. Most of them are in large situations
economic vulnerability, largely aggravated by food insufficiency in many
children.
Information collected from project implementation partners
20. These project players specify that in areas that have been targeted by Accelere, large
Part of the population could be concerned by the criteria of questionnaire files:
â¢ âIdentification of students on the basis of socio-economic criteria (extreme poverty of the
family, orphaned children, children living with disabilities, albinos, children's children or
separated, etc.) â(NGO Ecuador);
â¢ "The problem is the limited number of the students supported, since most
Schools are found in already very vulnerable circles "(NGO Haut Katanga);
21. For them, these sheets were not sufficiently discriminative to choose the 30 children who
would be helped among the number of those who are at the same level of vulnerability and who would also have
had to be helped. This leads to judge that, for these actors, the targeting of children has only been
Moderately relevant, and in their opinion, insufficient on the cover.
Information collected from primary schools directors
22. In the interviews and the focus where they express themselves, school directors make a
Similarity of points of view with the implementation partners. The conclusion is therefore identical:
The targeting system for very vulnerable children, limited to 30 of them, concerned a large
Children's population. To the questions asked, the teachers and the directors unanimously have
Answer yes to 100%:
â¢ "Are children who were targeted by the project are among the most needy?
â¢ Do their situations really correspond to the identification sheet?
â¢ all the selection sheet criteria really correspond to children's situations

Preliminary observations and conclusions
23. But the investigation of families and students seems to qualify these claims. Almost 30%
students gathered in the group focus do not recognize these the criteria of
Vulnerability placed in the identification sheet, with the exception of a low economical level.
24. Also, we believe that the criteria used were not sufficiently discriminatory and at the end
Designations of external influences have played to retain only the group of 30 assisted students.
The appreciation is the same as the previous one, average relevance.
Information collected from COPA and parents of students
25. They were the targeting players of very vulnerable children. COPA members have a
Similar speech but are not very soothed about the relevance of the selections made. This we
led to the same conclusion as above: average relevance.
Preliminary conclusions at Q3
PERT 5 - Thus, we can conclude that the targeting system for vulnerable children has been
Relevant, with regard to the concept of vulnerability which underlies the criteria of the selection. But, at
look at the sometimes extreme situations of targeted areas, the tools used seem not to
to have been sufficiently discriminating, which reduces the relevance of targeting (para. from 19 to 25).
10.1.4 Question 4: To what extent children's monitoring tools
beneficiaries have made it possible to measure the changes envisaged?
10.1.4.1 The tools for monitoring beneficiary children
26. The tools that have been made available to partners and teachers to follow the students
helped are as follows:
âª List of selected vulnerable students;
âª Presence register at tutoring courses;
âª Course and participation sheet in club activities;
âª Sheet of evaluations of absenteeism reasons;
âª Home tracking sheet cases of absences;
âª Collection sheet for performance data for vulnerable students and recovered door to door;
âª Personalized learning tracking sheet;
âª List of driving-to-door pupils;
âª Monthly activities and activity monitoring sheets, fulfilled by directors of
Primary schools (Project documents in appendix 10 of the subsidy management manual24).

school preparation and primary education will be improved for 310,500 children in
provinces of Katanga and Ecuador in the DRC. The expected changes are qualitative and
quantitatives, generated by activities developed for 3 school years:
âª Improvement of access to normal age school and keeping in the schooling of 35,000 students,
by the establishment of 100 CPP for primary preparation;
Figure 1: Ecuador pre-prime class
âª Increases access to education for vulnerable students by allocating 6,000 targeted students

school fees were covered and endowed with the school "kit" and 30,000 which only benefited
school "kit");
âª Improve school yields (success and maintenance) by implementing support
additional to learning and improved teaching practices benefiting from
240,000 vulnerable children in 1,000 primary schools.
10.1.4.3 Measuring the changes noted
28. It should be noted about these monitoring tools that the list of subsidized students is established in
Each school at the start of the project by the selection commissions. In case of departure, or abandonment
of a student, the director had to replace him with another meeting the criteria of the initial selection.
Also, the number of students helped remained constant in each school. However in the absence of a
individual registration system of students, this type of follow -up is not very relevant in the
of a longitudinal study of the students, at most he testifies to the regular presence of a group
of 30 students helped during the project period.
29. In addition, a monitoring mission commanded by the MEPST in January 202026 noted:

social protection activities, as well as strengthening the

real -time are appropriate with regard to the need for schooling for
most vulnerable children in the context of the DRC?
Part of the answer to this question was made above in paragraph 10.1.2. We
Let us examine more particularly the perception of beneficiaries.
10.1.5.1 Reminder of the schooling needs of vulnerable children
33. The 2016-2025 SSEF document, by a situation analysis highlights the needs of
Schooling of very vulnerable children. In the context of the DRC examined above in this
Document (paragraph 10.1.2.), Skilledly summarized, they are:
âª Improvement of access to schooling;
âª Improvement of girls' education;
âª Reduction of abandonments;
âª Improvement of academic success, redoubled reduction.
34. The national survey on the situation of children and adolescents outside the school29 in 2012,
also underlines other contextual elements which, by attacking stigma, influence access
and keeping in the school community. These are, among other things, the barriers linked to the
gender and the perception of the rights of the child by the community.
35. From the point of view of direct beneficiaries of the project, the schooling of subsidized students is
Mainly dependent on the economic factor, so the Accelere4 project! look for
essentially to reduce, if not to remove, the effect of it to help improve access to
Schooling.
10.1.5.2 Strategies implemented in response to needs
36. The interaction of activities operationalizing strategies must help meet the needs
schooling. This is so:
âª Strengthen maintenance in the primary cycle based on the medium -term effects of the
Prescolarization and "absenteeism alert";
âª Reduce financial obstacles to facilitate access to school (exemption from tuition fees and
endowment of small school equipment);
âª Support school learning through tutoring activities;
âª Foster the social integration of students in the school by developing extracurricular activities
from which they benefit.
37. We have above (part 10.1.2.) Already highlighted the relevance relationship between
needs and strategies.

âª For NGOs, the attendance of school teachers has progressed during the project duration;
âª For directors and teachers who confirm this previous observation, they felt more
Motivated in the exercise of their profession. They attribute this feeling to the image that was
returned by parents and children after tutoring and alert to
Absenteeism. However in the group focus, they turned out to be unable to describe the
realization of their assertive improvement;

Other students, boys and girls) in the three areas (registered at the start and end of the school year,

46. These requirements have led to eliminating many schools for the main reasons
following:
âª Total absence of data not compensated by taking into account a replacement school
Despite the instructions given;
âª Partial absence of data mainly on subsidized students;
âª Incons been in the information provided:

52. School maintenance is significantly higher among subsidized students than in other students.
This is valid for boys and girls. Among subsidized students, having a

32 The rate greater than 100% calculated for EAs is due to the fact that their number was not equal to the maximum eligible in

Preliminary observations and conclusions
54. However, from the moment that these recruitment practices during the year exist on
The whole period studied, the evolution of differences between unincyized children (ENA) and subsidized children (EA)
can be analyzed with the precautions for use. Chart 1 (Figure 3) first shows that the
school maintenance of the two students' subpopulations increases in conjunction with the practices of
recruitment mentioned above. Then, and that is interesting, the maintenance of the EA is
constantly higher than that of the ENA (of the order of 7 points).
55. Secondly, observing these gender developments shows that the best rates observed
Overall for EAs concern both boys and girls. Their developments are
however quite contrasting undoubtedly reflecting the fact that recruitments during the year
concern more boys than girls.

56. The success rate of subsidized students is, with one exception, always significantly higher than
that of other students in their class. This rate is, for students helped, on average 90% against
80% for other students. This observation is valid for boys and girls.
57. The first observation is that academic success therefore appears significantly superior
among EAs compared to the values observed in the ENA: between 12 and 16 points depending on the year
observed. The second observation is that this gap has been reduced in three years, going from 16 to 14
points in favor of EA.

59. For the concept of performance for teachers, we have retained the definition given by
UNESCO33 which proposes to measure it, on the one hand by respecting official objectives and
teaching program in educational practice, and on the other hand in their participation in
School activities.
60. Respect for the teaching objectives set by the national program is measurable by
observation of educational practices. However, in the context of this evaluation:
âª It should be noted the absence of a baseline describing these performance with precision on a sample

10.2.2.4 Student clubs
68. The date of starting club activities was very variable depending on the schools. The cause of
confessed differences seems to be in direct contact with the date of payment of the subsidy to
teachers involved. In all cases, directors claim that they themselves and

10.2.6 Question 6: What are the positive and negative changes to medium and
long term observed in beneficiaries?
90. In the absence of a baseline that recorded the attitudes and practices of the various
beneficiaries, leading to a longitudinal observation, the changes that appeared at the end of the project
cannot be really measured with certainty. However, we can try to
appreciate. Changes assessment is based on declarations and non-judgments
crited, either by the persons concerned themselves, or by external people. These
declarations are generally biased by the hope of seeing the renewal of the project, a source of
gains for beneficiaries. Sometimes they reflect frustrations and conflicts arose during
project between individuals and groups.
91. However, to try to account for it as best as possible, we use an approach to
introspective type36 with beneficiaries, questioning them about their perception of a possible
evolution of postures and skills. This approach cannot completely eliminate the many
bias that are likely to influence the answers but it can minimize them. Also, it is necessary
Consider the notable changes set out here with great caution.
10.2.6.1 among those responsible for the MEPST
92. To the question asked in the interviews with the focal points and the 3 sous prove of the effects
of the project on their representations and activities, they answer that the concept of social protection at the

36 The introspective method is part of the psychological methods based on dialogue and maintenance. Despite the richness of
its corpus and advantages in the collection of non -observable or measurable data such as opinions, feelings
and the attitudes of the interviewees. It has several biases and bias sources:
â¢ the heaviness of this technique and the difficulties linked to the management of interviews (need for continuous reframing and
Reformation, overtaking of the allocated time, bias of the language, etc.) is a source of biases;
â¢ The personal and subjective dimension of the participants remains difficult to control by the interviewer. This causes a
Disparity between the answers and even in relation to reality;
â¢ The effect of social desirability caused by this method is also a source of bias;
â¢ The variability of maintenance and intersubjectivity dynamics between the interviewer and the interviewee is another source
of bias that can impact the data collected and the analysis of this data.

Preliminary observations and conclusions
10.2.6.3 among teachers
96. Almost all the teachers interviewed in the group focus and by the NGOs that make them
report, declare that they have improved:
âª Regularity and punctuality in courses;
âª The holding of educational documents;
âª The organization of educational fun activities;
âª The attention paid to the most vulnerable students;
âª And recognize having reduced cases of bodily punishment.
10.2.6.4 Among the inspectors and those responsible for the MEPST
97. Beyond the demands on the material means of monitoring by supervisors, interviews
show that the changes made above all are an awareness of the need
to have to improve the protocols of visits to schools in order to better assess the implementation
Tutoring measures and student clubs.
98. However, none of these inspectors met (2 in Ecuador and 2 in Katanga) could
present a project to revise the traditional files of the educational inspection, while affirming
The existence of a reflection workshop on this subject. We interpret this situation as revealing
All in all an evolution of the role of the inspector towards an assessor posture.
10.2.6.5 In parents of students and COPA
99. They all claim to feel an increased interest in parents in the schooling of girls and
boys without gender distinction. However, the interviews did not make it possible to specify the
concrete manifestations of this interest.
10.2.6.6 In assisted students
100. The young people questioned did not provide real answers to this question which did not seem
concern them. It only appears that they believe that they have more interest in group activities
such as extracurricular activities.
Preliminary conclusions at Q6
Effective 6 - Interviews conducts with the various national responsible beneficiaries and
provincial of mepst, parents and assisted students) show that they would have felt changes,
Especially in their representations, which would be attributable to the project. But, with the exception of
teachers, who would have improved their practices we note that the changes would rather be
posture changes closer to problems with vulnerable children than development
Real professional skills (para. 92 to 100).
10.2.7 Question 7: did the implementation of the project influence the perception of
families, beneficiaries and communities on education in general
And access to school in particular?
101. Reports of NGOs and school directors do not take into account changes
of perceptions. Only the group focus with the parents of assisted students and the COPAs allowed us
to gather information on this point.
85 SOFRECO-PERSPECTIVE
Revised report
102. All parents of students and the members of the COPA who participated in the Focus recognize
the importance of school education to allow their children to improve their social situation
In the future, and for girls to find a "good husband".
However, access to school still seems relatively problematic to them:
â¢ "When my son is in school it costs me money because I have to dress it and that he
Can't help me in my job (vegetable merchant) and I pay another child to
This " - A mother in a group focus of Ecuador.
Several identical interventions concerning girls in particular have been noted.
103. The judgment which is focused on social protection activities seems to show a perception
more rewarding of the school through the involvement of teachers responsible for tutoring and visits
Family alert to absenteeism. These are perceived as an improvement in relationships
with school.
104. The family visit appears as an innovation that changes the image of the school and
teachers, both with families and assisted students who recognize in the focus
groups "[...] love my master more". (Raised in 17 focus out of 21)
105. Reported by several reports of implementation partners, confirmed in the Focus
groups with parents of students and assisted students, the problem of discrimination of certain
vulnerable students by other groups of students and by certain teachers, does not seem
completely resolved.
â¢ "Children of the school treat us badly because we are designated as
vulnerable â. (In 3 focus groups in SwhÃ©li high katanga, words translated not a
national expert)
106. In interviews with teachers, this fact is never mentioned before the assessors and,
When the question is asked, it is even denied.
Preliminary conclusions at Q7
Effective 7 - Families of beneficiaries, COPAs recognize that education is essential
For the social future of children. Tutoring and absenteeism alert improved the image they had
school and teachers (para. 104).
Students were very sensitive to teachers' visits to absenteeism alert (para. 104).
Declarations cannot however be supported by concrete observations of the
participation of students helped in exchanges with their comrades, the extracurricular activities having
all ceased since 2018. In addition, for lack of a preliminary study that would have reported
perceptions of the various beneficiaries, it is not possible to appreciate an evolution of the feelings, as
positive than negative (para. 90).
10.2.8 Question 8: What are the results not provided (positive and negative) of the
project ?
107. During the various interviews and in the group focus, we noted a number
unforeseen effects that appeared during the implementation of the project. It is most of the time of

Vulnerable children in the provinces of Ecuador, Haut Katanga, Tanganyika and Lualaba in the DRC
Preliminary observations and conclusions
10.2.8.1 Unforeseen results at the level of teachers
108. Teachers responsible for tutoring and student clubs received an allowance. This has
brought about a number of tensions between teachers designated for these activities and other
school teachers. The latter have resolutely diverted from the project activities. Among these
last, some then refused to welcome the students who had been helped,
Pretexting a significant shortfall. No remediation was carried out to correct and
Salle the tensions that followed. We see in this a weakness of communication
before and during the development of the project, as well as that of the management of the team
educational.
109. However, the generalization of freeness seems since then to have reduced, if not eliminated, these
reluctance. (Focus Groups with directors and teachers and parents of assisted students).
10.2.8.2 Unforeseen results at the level of parents of assisted students
110. Very vulnerable children helped by the schooling subsidy, because of this advantage,
were, the first year of the project, targets of another form of discrimination, sometimes of aggressions,
on the part of children and families in identical situations but which had not been taken in
charge. The latter felt a form of injustice against them, perception which was at the
Source of conflicts in playgrounds and on school paths, a little girl having been
injured in Katanga. Teachers were also taken to task by unlikely families. We
interpret these tensions as an insufficiency in the analysis of the situation before the implementation of the
project and as an information failure addressed to communities, which has been focused on
Management of tuition fees rather than a mobilization of actors around the school
to improve performance
10.2.8.3 Unforeseen results in terms of welcoming the most vulnerable children
111. Through the 21 focus groups organized during the field survey bringing together each
times the parents of the students who had been helped between 2015 and 2018, and the students helped during this
period, we noticed in the group focus that:
âª Invited to decline their profession, it appears that 27% of the parents were teachers or
employees of the MEPST, civil servants of the provincial directorates of state bodies, some
doctors and lawyers, and also a president of the school CPA who educated his 2 subsidized children37;
âª Children indicated their parents' profession when he knew her, thus confirming the

Preliminary conclusions at Q8
Effective 8 - The unexpected results, overall negative, were not corrected during

âª Tensions that have occurred between families and targeted children and those who have not been (para.
110);
âª Insufficient preparation of school directors including the authority on the allocation of the grant

Vulnerable children in the provinces of Ecuador, Haut Katanga, Tanganyika and Lualaba in the DRC
Preliminary observations and conclusions
For partners in the implementation of the project
118. For the majority of partners in the implementation of the project, the resources are divided into
two categories. The first is the compensatory subsidy of tuition fees awarded
annually to each of the project schools for the reception of the 30 subsidized students. In the opinion of
partners, it appeared to them sufficient. The second, the budget allocated for animators
community used by NGOs, has it proven to be insufficient, forcing them to limit the
Number of field visits, reducing the follow -up and support capacity of activities. Incidents
weather in certain areas have also led to more expenses that have resulted in
the decrease in the number of visits initially planned. In the opinion of these partners it would not have been
possible to carry out all the necessary monitoring activities with fewer financial resources.
For directors and teachers
119. Directors and teachers unanimously claim that the share of grant assigned to
tutoring, student clubs and absenteeism alert was very insufficient to maintain the
frequencies. What was achieved was within the limits of these budgets but has often proven itself
insufficient in relation to the needs of the operation and displacements involved in the alert to
Absenteeism for families far away from school, hence greater transport costs.
In addition, the subsidy intended to pay tuition fees seems to have been lower than the costs
normally perceived by the school, at the time of the project where free was not yet applied
necessarily, as the teachers felt "a shortfall" which would have
gradually weakened their commitment to the project.
120. It should be noted, however, that if the activities were carried out in a sustained manner during the 2
first years, at the announcement of the end of the project the teachers admit in the Focus Groups a
progressive disengagement in the middle of the 3rd year. We perceived in the group focus with the
teachers who received the grants allocated for the supervision of tutoring (25 USD per month
per individual over the school year), for extracurricular activities (250 USD for 2 in 5 teachers
month), for those of student clubs and for the reminder of absenteeism (2 USD monthly per member
of the alert commission), we have perceived that they considered them as a supplement of
salary that the project stopped had deleted.
â¢ "Why did we decrease our wages?" The project has impoverished us! " (Noticed
frequent in interviews with teachers).
Also, they do not design the maintenance of tutoring, student clubs and absenteeism alert
With less, or not, of resources. To this question all answered unanimously:
â¢ "We must give more money to teachers"!
We interpret these remarks of secondary beneficiaries as a system failure
information that was to support the implementation of the project.
For parents of students and copa
121. Parents of students and COPAs all believe that financial resources were
insufficient, not motivating all teachers sufficiently optimally and they
also acquiescent to the concept of "shortfall of teachers", leading according to them, to a
progressive demotivation. But, quite contradictorily, they admit, however, that activities have
been maintained during the first two years of the project, gradually being reduced to the
middle of the 3rd year of implementation.
93 SOFRECO-PERSPECTIVE
Revised report
Preliminary conclusions of the Q3
Effici 3 - For all the various secondary beneficiaries of the ACCELERE4 project! who have
expressed, the resources allocated to project activities were fully used for
programmed activities, but they were at the limit of insufficiency to achieve the objectives
fixed by the performance contract (para. 117 and 118).
However, it should be noted that, even in reduced number, the activities were maintained during the 2
first years and noting that in the 3rd year, when the project ended without the extension
hoped, teachers admit in the Focus Groups having gradually disengaged in
middle of the year at the stop of the project (para. 119, 120 and 121).
However, despite the feeling of insufficient financial resources, the reports of
Partner NGOs, Interviews with directors and results of the quantitative survey
make it possible to note that all the results of school performance seem to have been
affected (see Effici 2).
We believe that this is the maximum efficiency given the resources of the project.
10.3.4 Question 4: What are the management factors that have improved or reduced
The efficiency of this project?
We present below the various resource management factors that have reduced efficiency
of the project.
According to provincial representatives of UNICEF
122. The delay in payment of the subsidy. Many schools suspended project activities
While waiting for the grant to reach them. Also, the activities of tutoring and those of parascultural
did not cover the whole school year because they started beginners most often after the
first quarter of school when the grant arrives.
According to implementation partners
123. The payment delays of the subsidy are one of the main problems that slowed down
implementation of activities, without however that this influenced the expected results that were
transmitted by the annual report.
According to representatives of the mepst
124. Training supervised by locally recruited personnel by NGOs while they
had no knowledge or skills required. NGO representatives
(Aids and Sad Africa) do not dispute this point during interviews. It resulted from
Erroned interpretations of tutoring practices and extracurricular activities by teachers. We
Can consider that teacher training has not been sufficiently efficient.
For school directors
125. Delays in payment of school subsidies, generally at the start of the second
school quarter and also towards the end of the school year, as well as the period of the distribution of kits
schools have delayed the start of social protection activities:
âª The reception of subsidized students, although scheduled for the start of the school year, was postponed to half
and often at the end of the first quarter in 15% of the schools in the sample; directors
When questioned were not consistent on this point. We understood that the students
helped could be welcomed, but not registered;

resources have had no significant effect on the holding of the activities of student clubs that have
Often started during the 1st school quarter (surveys in schools). Note that, for
16 schools (6 in Ecuador and 10 in Katanga) who responded to the quantitative and indicated investigation
that activities started during the 1st quarter of the school year, they are the directors
who made mediation to teachers to encourage them to start activities. This
lights up the importance of the director, manager of the teaching team, a function that he will be desirable
to strengthen, through training and probably by a status adapted to this function.
Preliminary conclusions of the Q4
ELECTIIC 4
Previous remarks on the effect of management factors show weakness in the
control of the processes of the payment of subsidies whose delays resulted in a
sensitive reduction in the number of annual tutoring services, student clubs and the alert
Absenteeism. It is likely that without it better school performance results would have
could be reached (para. from 123 to 125).
Here it appears the importance of the role of the school director in the effective management of difficulties.
10.3.5 Summary of preliminary conclusions on the efficiency criterion
Efficate
The implementation of the Accelere4 project! has proven irregular efficiency mainly
for the payments of grants almost always paid very late not in relation to the dates
planned. This provoked unhappiness and demotivations of teachers, and deadlines in the
implementation of social protection activities. However, it must be recognized that the results
have been affected as a whole and on time.
The various actors and beneficiaries estimated that they could not have done better with the resources
allocated, nor with less, the level of resources having been generally estimated as barely
sufficient and could not support any remediation action.
On certain occasions of school directors have been able to reduce the negative impacts of factors of
unforeseen management.

â¢ Answer - by the activities of peace clubs and awareness (UNICEF administrator

176. However, their effect remains limited:
â¢ "Children who are always a little stigmatized are those who could be targeted but not
registered due to the small number of "scholarships". They are the subject of taunts of subsidians and
Others "(Director of a Mbandaka school).
177. The daily life of stigmatization within the school, bullying, aggressions, insults, was taken in
account by certain implementation partners who have developed "peace committees" in
Schools to educate students about the situation of some of them. Followed by game activities
bringing together all the students of the school, these activities seem to have limited the phenomena of
stigma in the school environment.
178. Likewise, partners' discussions with teachers tended to bring
arguments to strengthen their tolerance towards children "who did not report resources"
at school.
