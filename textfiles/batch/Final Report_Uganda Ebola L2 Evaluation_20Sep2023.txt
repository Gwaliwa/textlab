EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report describes the results of the Learning-Focused Evaluation (LFE) of UNICEF’s Level 2 (L2)
Ebola Preparedness and Response in Uganda (hereafter referred to as the ‘Ebola response’). The LFE
was led and implemented by the external evaluation firm hera (right to health and development). As
per the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Evaluation Policy, it was managed by UNICEF’s
Eastern and Southern Africa Regional Office (ESARO), in close collaboration with the UNICEF Uganda
Country Office (UCO) and in line with the UNICEF terms of reference (see Annex 1). The evaluation
was conducted from February to August 2023.
Background and context
Ebola is a severe, often fatal, illness in humans and non-human primates that is caused by a highly
virulent virus. The Government of Uganda (GoU) declared an Ebola outbreak on 22 September 2022
(Sudan virus) and called for assistance from the country’s partners to strengthen its preparedness and
response capacity. Four months after the first case, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the
outbreak over (on 11 January 2023). In total, the outbreak caused 164 cases, 142 of which were
confirmed and 22 of which were probable; there were 55 confirmed deaths. This was the eighth Ebola
outbreak declared in Uganda, marking the country's fourth outbreak within a decade and its fifth
outbreak of the Sudan virus strain of Ebola.
Object of the evaluation
UNICEF activated an L2 Corporate Emergency Activation Procedure (CEAP) Scale-up from 27 October
2022 to 26 April 2023 to respond to the Ebola outbreak in Uganda. The response was led by UNICEF’s
UCO, with support from ESARO and Headquarters (HQ). The primary goal of the L2 activation and the
implementation of the L2 emergency procedures was to scale up UNICEF’s response by providing
access to Emergency Programme Funds (EPF), deploying additional personnel from the regional office
and HQ, assisting to establish partnership initiatives, addressing supply chain requirements, continuing
advocacy efforts, and mobilising resources. The UNICEF Ebola Response Appeal budget totalled
US$18.3 million.
UNICEF’s Ebola response focused on supporting seven specific Ebola response pillars aligned to
GoU’s Ebola response: Coordination, Leadership, and Partnership; Risk Communication and
Community Engagement (RCCE); Surveillance and Contact Tracing; Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene
(WASH); Case Management; Addressing the Indirect Impact of the Outbreak; and Logistics and
Operational Support. UNICEF added mainstreaming gender-based violence (GBV) and protection from
sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA) as priorities.
Evaluation purpose, objectives, scope, and users
The LFE serves the dual purpose of promoting learning and accountability. The evaluation objectives
were, first, to assess UNICEF’s response to the Ebola outbreak in Uganda vis-à-vis issues of
appropriateness/relevance, effectiveness, efficiency (including value for money (VfM)), coverage,
connectedness, coordination, and partnerships; and, second, to draw out key learning and
recommendations to equip UCO decision makers with the information they need to formulate UCO’s
transition from L2 emergency to long-term strategy, ensuring humanitarian–development–peace (HDP)
nexus is in place and increasing preparedness for future public health emergencies (PHEs). The
intended beneficiaries include UNICEF staff, national and subnational ministries, donors, communities,
civil society organisations (CSOs), and other United Nations agencies. The evaluation scope
encapsulated the L2 UNICEF Ebola preparedness and response between 20 September 2022 and 26
1
April 2023 across the Ebola affected districts. It assessed certain institutional, programmatic, and
operational elements of the Ebola preparedness and response.
Evaluation design, methodology, sampling, limitations, and ethics
The evaluation was both summative and formative, and its design was realist-based and use-focused,
and allowed for robust analysis. It employed both quantitative and qualitative methods and tools. The
primary data collection included 101 key informant interviews (KIIs), 27 focus group discussions
(FDGs), a Community Rapid Assessment (CRA) (sample size: 524), and validation and co-creation
workshops. The CRA survey was a randomised population-based survey conducted by hera in
partnership with Viamo. A robot call sent a series of questions via mobile phone and gathered
information on respondents’ knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to Ebola. Additionally, the team
reviewed a variety of internal and external documents (369) as part of a secondary data analysis. Data
sources were triangulated where possible to ensure robust evidence. The evaluation encountered a
few limitations, and several mitigation measures were applied. The evaluation obtained ethical
clearance from Lacor Hospital Institutional Research and Ethics Committee and adhered to the ethical
principles of informed consent, voluntary participation, confidentiality, data protection, and ‘do no harm.’
Conclusions
The conclusions set out below are based on the LFE’s findings and have been colour ranked. Red
indicates that there were significant issues, delays, or problems with the intervention. Amber (Yellow)
signifies there were some concerns or risks that need attention. Green indicates that progress was as
planned and there were no major concerns or risks.
Conclusion 1: UCO’s in-country preparedness was not sufficiently relevant to an Ebola outbreak
and it did not allow for an efficient transition to the Ebola response. UNICEF’s 2021 Ebola
Preparedness and Response Plan was incomplete, and insufficient funding dedicated to preparedness
activities hindered the establishment of relevant partnerships, contingency plans, contingency budgets,
and the procurement of essential Ebola supplies. The transition from preparedness to response was
therefore challenging, and this was further hampered by UCO’s lack of familiarity with the L2 emergency
procedures and the small number of UCO staff with Ebola expertise. As the Ebola response
progressed, UNICEF demonstrated relevant adaptiveness, improving its preparedness measures. It
effectively mitigated some of these shortcomings by repurposing programme funds and resources,
deploying ESARO and UCO programme staff. In parallel, efforts by ESARO to invest in regional
preparedness across neighbouring countries demonstrated the importance of potential cross-border
spread of Ebola. However, the limited funding available raised questions about the extent to which
donors are committed to funding prevention efforts.
Conclusion 2: UNICEF’s leadership and coordination were mostly effective in ensuring the
response was coherent. UNICEF demonstrated commendable leadership and engagement in
coordinating response activities at both national and subnational levels. UNICEF’s active engagement
and its leadership role in co-chairing the RCCE pillars, as well as the sub-pillars of WASH and Infection
Prevention and Control (IPC), Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) and Continuity of
Essential Services (CoES), confirmed UNICEF’s comparative advantage in these pillars By fostering
collaboration among various local responders, such as the District Task Forces (DTFs) and District
Disaster Management Committees (DDMCs), UNICEF effectively aligned preparedness and response
efforts with national strategic plans. Moreover, UNICEF enhanced the relevance of the response by
expanding its reach and collaboration, including working with the Ministry of Gender, Labour, and Social
Development (MoGLSD) and the Ministry of Education and Sports (MoES) to promote a more multi-
sectoral response. In parallel, there were notable coordination challenges, albeit mostly at onset. Such
2
challenges included the multiple response plans, competing roles and overlap in mandates among
United Nations agencies, the absence of a clear inter-agency coordination mechanism, and also the
government’s unusual split of risk communication (RC) from community engagement (CE). These
issues resulted in gaps or delays in critical areas, such as safe and dignified burials (SDB), IPC, CE,
and Ebola case management, and raised questions about such arrangements for larger and more
extensive PHEs. At the same time, internal UNICEF coordination and support mechanisms involving
UCO, ESARO, and HQ were highly regarded.
Conclusion 3: UNICEF’s efforts had a significant and positive impact on affected populations.
The evaluation revealed many commendable efforts with high levels of appropriateness and
effectiveness in addressing key issues, contributing to early case detection and reducing transmission.
UNICEF’s RCCE activities led to behavioural change within communities through diverse mass media
channels which communicated tailored and appropriate key messages. The strategic engagement of
local responders and community influencers, and the implementation of Integrated Outbreak Analytics
(IOA) and anthropological studies, leveraged transdisciplinary data, helping to improve outbreak
decision-making. The integration of WASH/IPC across pillars, Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs), isolation
centres, community structures, and communities filled critical response gaps and showcased effective
strategies for future outbreaks, including the IPC Ring approach. The evaluation also identified that
UNICEF successfully facilitated access to essential nutritional supplies in ETUs, and that the response
exceeded its target for reaching children and affected populations accessing MHPSS. The integration
of MHPSS and child protection in the Ebola response through innovative partnerships received praise,
but these interventions also exposed the dire needs experienced by children and women. UNICEF's
efforts on education were a best practice and ensured every child attended school and completed their
final exams. Health continuity interventions ensured primary healthcare was maintained but the
lockdown measure, a lack of transport, and fear of Ebola transmission reduced healthcare utilisation.
Conclusion 4: The L2 procedures were not sufficiently applied. The effectiveness of the response
faced several challenges, including significant delays. The L2 response successfully mobilised a
substantial US$7,949,919, strategically allocating funds toward RCCE, case management, and
WASH/IPC, showcasing efficient resource utilisation and leveraging UNICEF's comparative advantage.
With support from ESARO, UNICEF demonstrated proactive measures by repurposing programme
funds, redeploying UCO staff, and initiating the response even before the L2 was activated. However,
the evaluation also identified areas for potential improvement, including the timing of the L2 activation,
which occurred 36 days after the declaration of the Ebola outbreak. Hesitancy about declaring an L2,
compounded by unfamiliarity with the L2 protocols, contributed to delays. Challenges in regard to
securing funding, gaps in human resources at the field level, a lack of contingency plans, procedural
delays in partnerships, and limited supplies adversely affected efficiency, leading to diminished
relevance in some cases.
Conclusion 5: UNICEF’s approaches were child-centred and integrated women’s needs and
other vulnerabilities. UNICEF successfully integrated education, child protection, GBV/PSEA, and
MHPSS into the national response, demonstrating the organisation’s commitment to addressing
multifaceted vulnerabilities. The active inclusion of children in decision-making processes
demonstrated a commitment to promoting children’s voices, while partnerships with child-focused
organisations increased the child-friendliness of the response. UNICEF provided gender-disaggregated
targets and results, employed gender-sensitive approaches, and prioritised GBV/PSEA. UNICEF also
implemented interventions for persons with disabilities, but only in certain aspects of the response.
While MHPSS services benefitted 16,359 children, the response did not address the long-term needs
of orphans and survivors. Important missed opportunities included a lack of advocacy for better
3
paediatric treatment protocols and ensuring timely paediatric medical supplies. The response also had
some unintended negative consequences, potentially increasing GBV cases during lockdowns and
hindering access to GBV services. While the response identified other vulnerable groups, it is not
certain to what extent assistance was provided to them, particularly for Ebola survivors. As a final
observation, the evaluation noted a gender imbalance at UCO, with an overrepresentation of male
employees.
Conclusion 6: The Ebola response showed linkage to UNICEF’s development agenda but
ongoing support to affected communities was lacking. There were clear linkages to UNICEF’s
development programming in support of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). UNICEF
supported policy development, invested in sustainable WASH/IPC infrastructures, and contributed to
enhanced preparedness, bolstering Uganda's resilience to future PHEs. UNICEF's support for the
Uganda National Post-Ebola Response Plan underscored its dedication to fostering continuity and
resilience beyond the immediate Ebola response. However, UNICEF’s exit from the response was
perceived as sudden and there were concerns around sustainability as some of UNICEF’s investments
were not adequately maintained. Cash grants, to help transition communities out of a crisis, were not
implemented. Direct support to Ebola survivors and affected children fell short. Supporting some HDP
nexus principles, there are indications that UNICEF strengthened certain linkages, including through,
joint country analysis, collaborative programming, building local capacities, and making risk-informed
decisions.
Key lessons learned
The evaluation identified several lessons for future similar disease outbreaks. The main ones include
the following:
 Lesson learned 1: Engaging a diverse spectrum of community influencers is a critical factor
in attaining impactful social and behaviour change during Ebola outbreaks. The approach
employed by UNICEF, wherein Village Health Teams (VHTs), traditional leaders, healers, local
politicians, musicians, and even transport drivers were effectively mobilised, can serve as a
successful model.
 Lesson learned 2: Developing an effective Ebola exit strategy requires establishing explicit
connections that can sustain results, while integrating consistent support for vulnerabilities
uncovered throughout the response. Notably, the UNICEF response identified a need for
continued child protection, MHPSS, and GBV services, but also sustained support to Ebola
survivors.
 Lesson learned 3: A proactive approach to reducing ambiguities in mandates between WHO
and UNICEF can improve the coherence of a response. Benefits can be obtained by pre-
emptively identifying specific interventions and delineating UNICEF's precise contributions
within the context of PHEs.
 Lesson learned 4: Applying the UNICEF emergency procedures helps ensure rapid and agile
emergency responses. This lesson serves as a reminder of the need to adapt development
procedures to align with the agile and adaptive requirements of emergency situations.
 Lesson learned 5: Extra efforts to tackle external barriers are required to ensure continuity of
essential services. This lesson underscores the need to address these barriers proactively in
future emergency scenarios.
Recommendations
The evaluation proposes several recommendations, which have been co-created by the evaluation
team and UNICEF. The recommendations have been formulated with the Evaluation Reference Group
4
(ERG) to guide responses to future Ebola outbreaks and similar PHEs in Uganda and beyond. The
ERG did not include external stakeholders. These recommendations are based on the LFE findings,
field evidence, stakeholders’ input, and document review, and insights from the evaluators. To ensure
alignment to UNICEF’s ambitions in regard to PHEs, the evaluation has framed the recommendations
around UNICEF’s White Paper1 and UNICEF’s Evaluation of the L3 Response to COVID-19. The
recommendations focus on six domains:
1. Strengthen preparedness for PHEs. Improve and make preparedness for PHEs more relevant in
Uganda, and more broadly in UNICEF. Strengthen overall preparedness plans, ensuring sufficient
and relevant supplies, disease-specific annexes of the preparedness plan and partnerships are in
place, and ensure epidemic preparedness is a key element in the UNICEF global Health Sector
Strategic Plans. Consider attaching performance indicators to PHE preparedness and learn from
UNICEF’s experiences in First Action Initiatives and the Co-Funding Initiatives.
2. Better institutionalise L2/L3 procedures. Improve familiarity with the L2/L3 emergency
procedures and consider non-refundable and easily accessible EPF funding mechanisms,
including to cover unforeseen costs. Consider standardising Ebola as an automatic L2 activation.
3. Strengthen inter-agency coherence in PHEs, in line with the Inter-Agency Standing
Committee (IASC) Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and Protocol for the Control of
Infectious Disease Events. Conduct annual joint assessments of in-country cross-pillar
preparedness, with a focus on clarifying the global-level blueprint at national level, in collaboration
with WHO and the GoU. Promote joint assessments and Ebola plans, develop a United Nations
advocacy strategy to promote cash-based interventions during PHEs, and promote the idea of
activating a United Nations coordination mechanism under WHO for Ebola. Improve longer-term
inter-agency support to Ebola survivors.
4. Continue placing children, women, and vulnerabilities at the centre of the PHE response.
Ensure responses for women, children and vulnerable groups at early onset of a disease outbreak
including quality referral for GBV/PSEA, child protection, and strengthen and advocate for gender
equality in the UCO employment, and with the GoU.
5. Prepare for better data to drive evidence-based responses. Provide ongoing support to the
GoU on implementing the IOA initiative. Develop tailored tools to collect data on children, women,
and vulnerability, and develop an Ebola research agenda specifically focused on children. Continue
developing community feedback mechanisms and digitalising the VHT community surveillance.
6. Keep advancing on the HDP nexus procedures. Build awareness around One Health and the
link between climate change and emerging diseases. Ensure more systematic engagement with
the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005). Continue building on risk-informed and multi-year
programming through multi-agency partnerships, and build the emergency response capacity of
local CSOs. Start tackling the underlying causes of child protection risks and link this to
humanitarian cash transfers.

1 INTRODUCTION
This report describes the results of the LFE of UNICEF’s L2 Ebola response. The LFE was led and
implemented by independent consultants from the evaluation firm hera (right to health and
development). As per the UNICEF Evaluation Policy, it was managed by ESARO, in close collaboration
with UCO.
While the LFE serves the dual purpose of promoting learning and accountability, it puts a strong focus
on drawing learned lessons that can inform future actions. The lessons aim to promote learning to
support long-term planning post the L2 response to the Ebola emergency in Uganda, but also to identify
preparedness interventions for potential future health emergencies, and to strengthen UNICEF’s
accountability to affected populations, partners, and donors supporting the response at large.
UNICEF’s response to the Ebola emergency aimed to contribute to Ebola-related mortality and disease
transmission by facilitating timely action on a no-regrets basis through establishing multi-sectoral inter-
agency partnerships, collaboration with national and local governments, and a sustained presence by
partners wherever possible. The LFE was conducted from February to August 2023.
The evaluation report consists of seven sections. After this introduction, the second section provides
an overview of Ebola in its broader context, as well as in Uganda. The third section presents the
objectives of the evaluation. The fourth section describes the evaluation purpose, objectives, scope,
and users. The fifth section provides information about the design, approach, methods, limitations, and
ethics. The sixth section describes the evaluation findings and analysis, a series of innovations and
missed opportunities during the response, and lessons from the Ebola response. The seventh section
presents the conclusions, lessons learned, and a set of recommendations. The annexes contain
supporting data, documents, and evidence.
2 BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
This section explores the context of Ebola disease within the field of global health, UNICEF’s regular
programming in Uganda, and UNICEF’s multi-sectoral response to the latest Ebola outbreak in Uganda.
It also provides a description of expected vulnerabilities in Ebola outbreaks, with a focus on women
and children. This section has been informed by a document review of grey and academic literature.
2.1 The global Ebola context
Ebola is a severe, often fatal, illness in humans and non-human primates that is caused by a highly
virulent virus known as Ebola virus, which belongs to the family Filoviridae. The virus was first
discovered during two major outbreaks in South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
in 1976i. Subsequent Ebola outbreaks were reported in Uganda and the DRC in 1994 and 1995,
respectively. Since then, frequent large outbreaks have occurred in Gabon, DRC, Uganda, Guinea,
Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Nigeriaii, with isolated outbreaks reported in South Africa, the US, the UK,
and Italy. Six species of the genus Ebolavirus have been identified, these include the following: Zaire
ebolavirus, Bundibugyo ebolavirus, Sudan Virus Disease, and Côte d'Ivoire ebolavirus, which cause
disease in humans; Reston, which causes disease in non-human primates and pigs; and Bombali, for
which there is no evidence of disease in humans, non-human primates, or other animals as yetiii. The
majority of outbreaks in Africa have been associated with the Zaire, Bundibugyo, and Sudan species.
The Ebola outbreak that occurred in West Africa between August 2014 and June 2016 stands as the
largest and most widespread outbreak of Ebola in history. Recognising its severity, the WHO declared
6
it a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC)iv. This devastating outbreak resulted in
over 28,000 reported cases and claimed the lives of more than 11,000 individualsv. It served as a stark
reminder of the dire consequences that weak health systems can have for global health security, and
highlighted the importance of investing in the development of health infrastructure in low- and middle-
income countriesvi.
The failures observed during the 2014–2016 outbreak were significant, as actions taken by both
national and international entities deviated from the established strategies that the international
community had designed and implemented over the course of two decades to manage global health
security threatsvii. The outbreak, which spread across international borders (including through air
travel), had a profound impact on global health. It raised important questions regarding the
effectiveness of the implementation of the IHR of 2005, and spurred the development of the Global
Health Security Agenda. This initiative aims to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease
threats on a global scale, shaping the way the international community approaches such challengesviii.
Ebola is listed in the IHR as a potential PHEIC2. Since the adoption of the revised IHR by WHO and
196 countries in 2005, there has been a shift in how governments, non-state actors, and WHO approach
infectious disease threatsix. The new approach integrates public health and security thinking to
effectively address these threats. The IHR (2005) emphasises that addressing infectious disease
threats should not be limited to the purview of health officials alone but should also be prioritised in the
agendas of political, economic, and diplomatic leadersx. It recognises that responses to infectious
diseases such as Ebola have implications for the interests of all states. By linking public health and
security considerations, the revised IHR encourages a comprehensive and collaborative response to
infectious disease threats. It underscores the need for coordination, cooperation, and engagement
across various sectors and stakeholders to effectively manage and mitigate the impact of diseases like
Ebola.
Ebola is considered a re-emerging disease. While the Ebola virus was first identified in 1976, sporadic
outbreaks occurred with increasing frequency in the decades that followed. Ebola epidemics also began
to spread faster and furtherxi. The Ebola crossover to humans is influenced by factors like population
growth, deforestation, and direct interaction with wildlifexii.
‘Epidemics of infectious diseases are occurring more often, and spreading faster and further than
ever, in many different regions of the world. The emergence of large-scale epidemics (such as Ebola,
SARS and, more recently, COVID-19), the re-emergence of old diseases (such as haemorrhagic
dengue), and the persistence of epidemics of controllable diseases (such as measles, cholera, or
malaria) have led national governments and global institutions to consider epidemics to be one of
the most serious major public health emergency threats for the 21st century.’

These transmissions between human and animal highlight the need for a ‘One Health’ approach that
addresses human, animal, and environmental health together. One Health, as defined by WHO, seeks
to optimise the health of people, animals, and ecosystems through integrated efforts across sectors
and disciplinesxiii. By mobilising multiple stakeholders and aligning with the SDGsxiv, this approach
promotes wellbeing and sustainability. In response to the Ebola outbreaks in West Africa, significant
2 The decision to declare a PHIEC is made by the WHO DG, based on advice from the constituted IHR Emergency committee
for Ebola. Conditions that do not require an IHR decision in order for a PHIEC to be declared are the following: a) polio caused
by wild-type poliovirus; b) smallpox; c) SARS; and d) human influenza caused by a new subtype.
7
progress has been made in developing medical countermeasuresxv. However, it is crucial to combine
these advancements with comprehensive public health strategies, effective communication, modelling,
and ecological/environmental approaches to effectively prevent and mitigate the impact of future
emerging diseases like Ebolaxvi.
The natural reservoir host of Ebola remains unknown. However, based on evidence and understanding
of the nature of similar viruses, researchers believe that the virus is animal born and that bats are the
most likely reservoir. Sudan virus disease (SVD), one of the six species of the Ebola genus, is highly
lethal, with case fatality rates (CFRs) ranging from 53% to 100%xvii. Gulu district in Northern Uganda
experienced the largest outbreak caused by SVD prior to the West Africa Ebola outbreak, resulting in
a CFR of 53%xviii. SVD spreads through direct contact with the blood, tissues, and bodily fluids of
infected humans or animals. The virus can persist in certain areas of the body and fluids even after
recovery and can last for an extended period, up to as much as five yearsxix.
2.2 The Uganda Ebola outbreak
The Republic of Uganda, located in East Africa, is a landlocked country that is divided into four regions:
Central, Western, Eastern, and Northern. These regions are further divided into 146 districts, with one
of those districts being the capital city Kampala. Urban areas account for approximately 12% of the
country's population, with the Central region housing the majority of the urban populationxxxxi,
particularly in the city of Kampala. Uganda has a total population of approximately 48 million, including
8.2 million children below five years old and 18.7 million children below 15 years oldxxii. The country
has an estimated annual population growth rate of 2.7%. In terms of human development, Uganda
ranks 162nd out of 189 countries on the Human Development Index. The country's expenditure on
health represents 3.94% of gross domestic productxxiii, while education expenditure is 2.7%xxiv.
Uganda's encounter with Ebola disease has left a lasting impact on the country's public health
landscape, highlighting the ongoing challenges in tackling Ebola and emphasising the need for
continuous vigilance and preparedness. This is in a country context that is marked by multiple disease
outbreaks and public health emergency events, such as cholera, yellow fever, meningitis, measles, rift
valley, black water, malaria, and acute malnutrition during drought, which all claim more lives than
Ebola because of the proportion of the population that are affected. However, with Ebola’s high CFR,
the impact can be devastating and so like all of the other disease outbreaks Ebola requires a dedicated
response.
The first recorded Ebola outbreak in Uganda occurred in Gulu district in 2000 and resulted in 425 cases
and 224 deaths (see Figure 1). Subsequently, another outbreak of the Ebola Bundibugyo virus took
place in 2007 in Bundibugyo district, leading to 131 cases and 42 fatalities. Between 2011 and 2012,
three smaller outbreaks of the SVD occurred. In 2018, an outbreak of the Zaire ebolavirus was reported,
resulting in four cases and a 100% CFR. These incidents demonstrate the ongoing threat posed by
Ebola in Uganda, emphasising the critical need to maintain preparedness measures and efficient
response capabilities.
The economic ramifications associated with Ebola are well-documented and are primarily attributable
to the imposition of public health and social measures, and a contraction in economic activity, ultimately
leading to a loss of livelihoods, diminished productivity, and compromised economic growthxxv.
Challenges encountered in any of these domains can present significant obstacles to the government's
response efforts at both the national and district levels. The effectiveness of the GoU Ebola response
hinges upon several key factors, including the attainment of economic and political stability, the capacity
to govern efficiently, the robustness of healthcare infrastructure, the availability of economic resources,
8
the level of public health awareness, and the active engagement of communities. Furthermore, the
GoU's ability to coordinate a comprehensive and multifaceted response, while prioritising various
components, remains instrumental in navigating the complex landscape of Ebola prevention,
preparedness, and control.
Figure 1. Uganda Ebola outbreaks and CFR (Source: Ministry of Health (MoH) of Uganda)
On 20 September 2022, Uganda recorded a confirmed case of the SVD in Ngabano Village in Madudu
sub-county, Mubende district. Prior to this, in August, two sub-counties (Kiruma and Madudu) reported
a cluster of six unexplained deaths, which were subsequently classified as probable cases of SVD
(refer to Figure 2). Initial cases were subsequently identified through private clinics. The outbreak's
epicentre was in Mubende district, which closely borders the neighbouring district of Kassanda, situated
approximately three hours away from the capital city of Kampala and other densely populated regional
towns. This proximity, and factors such as exposure during burials, family interactions, and interdistrict
population movements, contributed to the transmission of the virus to neighbouring districts, including
the capital city. By 8 December 2022, a total of 142 cases, including 55 deaths, were reported across
nine affected districts: Mubende, Kassanda, Kyegegwa, Bunyangabu, Kagadi, Kampala, Wakiso,
Masaka, and Jinjaxxvi (see Figure 3). In addition, the lack of approved vaccines and therapeutics for
SVD represented an additional challenge in curbing the outbreak.

MoH)

Subsequent to the declaration of the Ebola outbreak, MoH in Uganda formulated a comprehensive
National Ebola Response Planxxvii. To facilitate the coordinated implementation of activities, Uganda’s
National Task Force (NTF) started holding dedicated Ebola coordination meetings, applying an Incident
Management Team (IMT) structure and using the Public Health Emergency Operations Centre
(PHEOC) to facilitate the coordination. Before Ebola, the DTFs had last been activated for COVID-19.
The DTFs also received Incident Managers from the national level to facilitate high-level coordination
for the outbreak response.
Figure 3. Map of Uganda (Source: GoU)
Additionally, various structures were established to ensure effective management of the outbreak,
including the IMT, response pillar leadership, DTFs, and District Health Management Teams, which
were either led by local authorities or partner organisations. The response plan encompassed nine
operational pillars and involved the categorisation of districts based on their level of risk. It spanned a
period of three months from October to December 2022, with a primary focus on high-risk districts.
However, the GoU encountered challenges in terms of funding, supplies, and capacity, necessitating
the call for partners to contribute to the required budget of US$20,550,322xxviii.
MoH took the lead in coordinating the response, receiving support from 56 partners, with WHO as co-
lead. These partners included national NGOs, international NGOs, United Nations agencies such as
WHO, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the World Food Programme
(WFP), and the International Organization for Migration, as well as donors, academic institutions, and
the private sector. Importantly, other crucial partners in the response included local leaders, religious
leaders, traditional healers and witchcraft practitioners, transport drivers, village volunteers, and
security forces. Following the COVID-19 outbreak, several important community structures were
established, and these continued to be used for Ebola. These included village and parish task forces,
VHTs, and village hygienistsxxix. The VHTs are the formal community health workers in Uganda and
10
they provide both preventive and community curative care. They have historically been involved in
outbreak response.
In response to the spread of Ebola to Kyegegwa, Kagadi, and Bunyangabu districts, and the reluctance
of certain populations to comply with containment measures3, on 15 October 2022 the GoU
implemented a 42-day lockdown, movement restrictions, and a two-week curfew. While such measures
are considered a public health measure to contain transmission, it is important to recognise that they
may adversely affect the ability of already vulnerable populations to sustain their livelihoodsxxx.
Furthermore, the risk of intra-national and international cross-border transmission poses significant
concerns in regard local and global safety, biosecurity, and trade. There were concerns regarding
Ebola’s potential transmission beyond Uganda's borders, facilitated by the movement of individuals, for
trade and other purposes. Further, it is worth mentioning that the Ebola outbreak occurred two and a
half years after the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, which had severely strained all pillars of the health
system and impacted negatively on the socio-economic situation of the country As a result, the
population exhibited apathy, and healthcare workers experienced burnout.
On 11 January 2023, four months after the first case, MoH, supported by WHO, declared the outbreak
overxxxi. In total, during the outbreak there were 164 cases (142 confirmed and 22 probable), 55
confirmed deaths, and 87 recovered patients. This includes 19 infected health workers, including seven
deaths. There were a total of 1,496 suspected cases and 4,973 people were identified as contacts. The
distribution by gender shows that males were disproportionally more affected in terms of both caseload
(57.9%, n=164) and deaths (55%, n=55), compared to females. The overall CFR was 39%xxxii. This was
the eighth Ebola outbreak to be declared in Uganda, marking the country's fourth outbreak within a
decade and its fifth outbreak of SVD (refer to Figure 1).
2.3 Children, women, and vulnerabilities
The breakdown of 2022/23 Ebola cases by age highlights the significant impact of the disease on
children under 15 years of age. Data reveals that children under 15 years old, under five years old, and
under one year old constituted 20%, 7%, and 1% of the total caseload, respectively. Among the 37
children infected with Ebola, the CFR was 60%, which is significantly higher than the CFR in the general
population (39%). Before the official declaration of the Ebola outbreak, there were 11
probable/suspected cases among children, all of whom diedxxxiii. Children, especially those under five
years old, are more vulnerable to severe illness and death from infectious diseases, due to their weaker
immune systems. The higher proportion of the 2022/23 Ebola cases among children under 15 years
old suggests that they may be more exposed to the virus, due to factors like close contact with family
members and animals, and inadequate preventive measures at the household levelxxxiv xxxv. Moreover,
children, along with their mothers, may face a greater risk of Ebola transmission as they seek healthcare
for common febrile illnesses like malaria, and nosocomial transmission can occur on paediatric and
maternity wardsxxxvi. Traditional care-giving – particularly among females – and visiting traditional
healers for febrile illnesses may also contribute to nosocomial Ebola infections in childrenxxxvii xxxviii.
Furthermore, diagnosing Ebola in small children is difficult due to their vulnerability to multiple childhood
infections, non-specific clinical manifestations of the disease, and the fact that Ebola initially mimics
malaria and other febrile illness. Cumulatively, these factors lead to delayed diagnosis and multiple
consultations at private, public, and non-biomedical (traditional/spiritual) facilities. This results in
delayed treatment and/ or potential missed cases. Besides the severe physiological impact of the

Kampala City), and cultural practices such as consulting traditional healers and witchcraft.
11
disease, it has psychological and social impacts on children, including isolation and loss of parents,
which can have lasting effects. Orphaned children are particularly vulnerable to stigmatisation, isolation,
and exploitationxxxix. A recent WHO report has made it clear that a multifaceted approach to protect
children in Ebola outbreaks is necessary, and that resources should be put in place for long-term
support programmes to help affected communitiesxl.
While the disaggregation of Ebola cases by gender shows that males were disproportionally affected
(57.9%) (not uncommon in the initial phases of Ebola or epidemics, as a result of work-related
exposure), women, in their roles as primary caregivers and clinicians (women dominate the nursing
cadres), faced an increased risk of contracting the virus while assisting infected individuals. Women’s
role in performing traditional burial practicesxli, and inequitable power relations, both place women in
vulnerable positions in terms of being exposed to the Ebola virus.xlii. Ebola outbreaks can further hinder
access to care for pregnant women due to closed health facilities, overwhelmed healthcare staff, fear
of transmission, and stigma. Ebola-infected pregnant women also experience high rates of miscarriage.
Also, the survival rates for Ebola-infected newbornsxliii is very low.
In parallel, GBV, including sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA), remains a significant challenge in
Uganda in generalxliv, with approximately 22% of women aged 15–49 reporting experiencing physical
violence and 14% reporting experiencing sexual violence at some point in their livesxlv. Furthermore,
the disproportionate and exacerbating impact of crises on violence and gender has been well-
documented. This highlights that Ebola interventions need to look beyond just Ebola itself, as the
situation for vulnerable populations – particularly women and children – will remain challenging even
after the containment of the Ebola outbreak.
Ebola’s impact on persons with disabilities is not well-documented in the literature. Indeed, it is often
the most marginal and vulnerable groups who are systematically ignored by, and not reached by,
biomedical interventions, including those relating to Ebolaxlvi. In alignment with the World Humanitarian
Summit and the SDGs, the aid sector, including UNICEF, has pledged to ‘leave no one behind’ and
aims to address the health needs of marginalised and highly vulnerable populations, including persons
with disabilitiesxlvii. The LFE paid particular attention to the integration of persons with disabilities and
people with other vulnerabilities in the response; it found that assistance to them was integrated
throughout the Ebola response and recovery phase.
Multiple disease outbreaks in Uganda, including Ebola, are linked to inadequate access to clean water
and sanitation. In Uganda, 48.1% of healthcare facilities have limited water services, and 57.4% have
limited hand hygiene servicesxlviii. These are critical issues to address to curb future outbreaks.
Travel restrictions and lockdowns have been known to exacerbate existing vulnerabilities, in particular
those of women, girls, and children. xlix, l For example, decreased utilisation of health services can result
in plummeting immunisation rates, while faltering use of maternal and perinatal services may increase
premature deathsli. The impacts on the mental health of children and women have also been
convincingly established, with lockdowns associated with surges in depression, anxiety, and low levels
of life satisfaction. Vulnerability may also be exacerbated by disrupted livelihoods, leading to increased
levels of povertylii.

3.2 UNICEF in Uganda
The UNICEF Uganda Country Programme Document (CPD)lvii for 2021–2025 outlines a
comprehensive five-year framework that serves as a multi-sectoral roadmap for protecting and
improving the situation of children and adolescents in Ugandalviii. The plan has been developed
collaboratively (with the GoU and partners) and contributes to continued progress towards several
SDGs. The CPD prioritises the following: education; child protection; social protection; health;
reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health; HIV/AIDS; nutrition; and WASH. It also
lists cross-sectoral themes, including early childhood development, adolescent development, social
and behaviour change, and advocacy. The CPD further seeks to accelerate change for the most
deprived children through a focus-district strategy targeting districts with the highest numbers and rates
of child deprivation or with high vulnerability to external shocks, including disease outbreaks.
In addition to UCO’s development work, the organisation engages in humanitarian interventions,
including supporting refugees and contributing to emergency preparedness and response, such as
disease outbreaks, climate-induced droughts, and floods. The humanitarian response is carried out in
partnership with organisations like UNHCR, and aligns with the Uganda Comprehensive Refugee
Response Frameworklix, the commitments of the Grand Bargain4, and the current CPD, with a focus on
strengthening district-level systems. UCO supports district actors in integrating humanitarian
preparedness and response into their annual and midterm plans. Following the COVID-19 pandemic,
UCO launched humanitarian appeals – Humanitarian Action for Children (HAC) – in 2022lx and 2023lxi,
with a total requirement of US$25 million and US$43 million respectively, aiming to assist 1.2 million
children in 2022 and 1.9 million children in 2023. Through its humanitarian action, the organisation
4 The Grand Bargain is a commitment made by major humanitarian donors and organisations to improve humanitarian action
through enhancing collaboration, transparency, and accountability by promoting reforms in areas such as localising aid,
reducing duplication, and increasing the flexibility and quality of funding.
13
focuses on building resilient health systems by strengthening the government's response and training
health workers on innovative approaches to community-based care provision during crises. UNICEF
played a significant role in the COVID-19 response by establishing a school disease surveillance
system, facilitating COVID-19 vaccine deployment, and installing oxygen production plants in regional
referral hospitals. During previous Ebola outbreaks, the UCO collaborated with GoU and WHO on
response planning, outbreak analytics, and social and behaviour change communication.
3.3 UNICEF’s Ebola response
After the declaration of the Ebola outbreak, UNICEF activated an L2 CEAP Scale-up5 from 27 October
2022 to 26 April 2023. The primary goal of the L2 activation and the implementation of the L2
emergency procedureslxii was to scale up UNICEF’s response by providing access to EPF, deploying
additional personnel from the regional office and HQ, assisting with partnership initiatives, addressing
supply chain requirements, continuing advocacy efforts, and mobilising resources. The UNICEF
response plan required a total commitment of US$18.3 million.
Shortly after the GoU’s declaration of the Ebola epidemic, UCO updated the Ebola Response Planlxiii.
The plan covered the period from October 2022 to March 2023 and was aligned with the Uganda
National Response Plan, the WHO Ebola Global Strategic Response Planlxiv, and UNICEF’s HAC. It
assumed Scenario 26 of the Uganda National Response Plan and initially targeted 20 high-risk districts.
The plan was informed by lessons learned from previous Ebola outbreaks. UNICEF’s Ebola Response
Plan aimed to facilitate timely action on a no-regrets basis through establishing multi-sectoral inter-
agency partnerships, collaboration with national and local governments, and sustained presence by
partners wherever possible.
The specific objectives of the UNICEF Ebola Response Plan were as follows:
 Strengthen multi-sectoral national and subnational coordination by participating in the
national and district taskforces, United Nations Coordination, the Steering Committee, and
other forums.
 Increase public awareness of the threat of Ebola and galvanise community action for
prevention, timely reporting, and early treatment-seeking, and to reduce the impact on children.
 Support Ebola case management, ensuring that there is appropriate management, including
feeding for infants and young children, psychosocial support, and child protection in outbreak-
affected and high-risk districts.
 WASH: ensure WASH in ETUs, and apply a Ring approach around cases, to prevent
transmission.
 Prevent and address the indirect impact of the outbreak and minimise the negative human
and socio-economic impacts.
 Use IOA to better understand outbreak dynamics and inform response adaptation to be more
accountable and effective, based on evidence.
 Ensure that GBV and PSEA risk mitigation is mainstreamed throughout the response.
To achieve the intended objectives, UNICEF's Ebola Response Plan focused on seven response areas:
Coordination, Leadership, and Partnership; RCCE; Surveillance and Contact Tracing; WASH; Case
Management; Addressing the Indirect Impact of the Outbreak; and Logistics and Operational Support.
5 The UNICEF L2 emergency response provides country offices with the capacity to scale up emergency interventions through
additional support from other parts of the organisation (HQ, the regional office, and other country offices). The Regional
Director provides leadership, and regional office support is enhanced.
6 Scenario 2: Delayed detection of cases, with the outbreak spreading beyond the epicentre to other districts. The response
runs for six to nine months.
14
UNICEF also prioritised mainstreaming GBV and PSEA. However, the delineation of response pillars,
between UNICEF and the GoU, in the Ebola response, was not straightforward, as is shown in Figure
4. The GoU Response Plan was based on the WHO medical pillars, which, while valuable, do not
include child-focused, public health systems priorities, as are outlined in the UNICEF White Paper.
Figure 4. UNICEF's response areas and their alignment with GoU response pillars (Source:
Developed by the evaluation team based on the GoU’s National Ebola Response Plan and the
UNICEF Ebola preparedness and response plans)
GoU Ebola response pillars UNICEF’s contribution to Ebola response pillars
The UNICEF Ebola Response Plan did not refer to human rights or gender equality specifically.
However, in regard to the RCCE response pillar and CoES, there is explicit reference to protecting and
reinforcing the capacity of vulnerable populations, including women and youth groups, health workers,
refugees, children, and school-going children, as well as households directly affected by Ebola and
Ebola-related stigma (Ebola cases, those in isolation, Ebola contacts).
Supporting the GoU in the Ebola response, UNICEF responded under a coordinated structure (with
other United Nations agencies and partners) through direct implementation and through implementing
partners such as the Association of Volunteers in International Service (AVSI), Lutheran World
Federation (LWF), Save the Children, World Vision, and the Ugandan Red Cross. At national and
subnational levels, UNICEF supported MoH, MoES, and MoGLSD. In parallel, it collaborated within the
GoU emergency response systems, including the NTF and the IMT, including at subnational levels.
Further, at the subnational level, UNICEF supported local responders, including district and village
authorities, health teams, task forces, hygiene teams, burial teams, and teachers. As rights holders,
the communities themselves, and in particular the local leaders (religious, cultural, and traditional
healers), were central in the response, both in receiving assistance and contributing to the assistance.
In addition, UNICEF developed a Post-Ebola Response Plan covering the period from January 2023 to
July 2023lxv. This plan was aligned with the Uganda National Post-Ebola Recovery Planlxvi and covered
a period of 180 days (five months) from February to June 2023. The national plan focused on the same
seven response areas as the UNICEF Ebola Response Plan and called for a total budget of
US$1,570,000.
15
3.4 Theory of change
A theory of change (ToC) was not produced as part of the Uganda Ebola L2 programme documents.
This is not a requirement in emergency response (according to the UNICEF Core Commitments for
Children (CCCs) for PHEs and any other standard emergency response criteria). However, the
evaluation team retrospectively developed a ToC that outlines the logic underlying how and why desired
changes were expected to occur as a result of UCO’s Ebola response activities (see Table 1). This ToC
was constructed based on UNICEF guidelines and in collaboration with UCO. The ToC includes a goal,
impact statements, outcomes, output interventions, a problem statement, and cross-cutting
interventions. The ToC outlines the logical framework needed to assess the effectiveness of the Ebola
response. The outputs align with activity indicators in UNICEF’s Ebola response monitoring system
(see Annex 12). The outcomes are derived from the seven response areas outlined in UNICEF’s Ebola
Response Planlxvii.
The theory behind the UNICEF Ebola response is as follows:
 IF the severity of the Ebola outbreak exceeds the existing response capacities of the UCO,
 AND UNICEF activates a CEAP L2 emergency, triggering the establishment of the emergency
cell and coordination mechanisms, the deployment of staff and supplies, and access to
additional financial resources,
 AND UNICEF contributes to the Ebola response pillars, by proactively coordinating [THE
RESPONSE PILLARS AND SUB-PILLARS], funding [GOVERNMENT AND PARTNERS],
supporting [GOVERNMENT, PARTNERS, AND POPULATION] and implementing [EIGHT
RESPONSE AREAS] under the National Ebola Response Programme, while upholding
UNICEF CCCs and adhering to L2 MECHANISM PROCEDURES],
 THEN UNICEF’s efforts will contribute to the national Ebola preparedness and response plan
to reduce the increased needs of the affected populations in the relevant districts, save lives,
and halt Ebola epidemic transmission.
The assumptions underlying the ToC are as follows:
 The required financing, supplies, and human resources are available.
 The required cooperation between the GoU and local and international partners is in place.
 An adequate number of qualified implementing partners are available.
 The affected communities collaborate and adopt social behavioural change to reduce
transmission.
 The UCO receives sufficient technical, financial, and other resources from the regional office
and HQ.

4 PURPOSE, OBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND USERS
This section starts by setting out the purpose and the objectives of the LFE. This is followed by a description
of the evaluation’s scope and its intended users.
4.1 Purpose
Overall, the LFE aims to fulfil the accountability requirement set out in UNICEF’s Evaluation Policylxviii, by
providing information to donors and community members – particularly children – about the effectiveness
of UNICEF’s Ebola L2 response as regards achieving its goals and addressing identified needs. The
purpose of the LFE is two-pronged: to promote learning and accountability. More specifically, it is expected
that the LFE’s findings and recommendations will be used by UNICEF personnel to inform UCO’s
subsequent preparedness and response efforts vis-à-vis future PHEICs in Uganda – especially viral
haemorrhagic fever (VHF) outbreaks. The evaluation aims to do the following: identify preparedness
measures UNICEF (at the UCO, ESARO, and HQ levels) can take to better prepare for and respond to
future PHEICs; highlight areas in which UCO was able to successfully exploit areas of comparative
advantage (for the benefit of affected populations, implementing partners, and the GoU); identify areas
where UCO’s performance could be improved at both sectoral and institutional/ structural levels; adumbrate
how UCO can enhance its accountability to affected populations (AAP), as well as partners and donors;
and, lastly, pinpoint how UNICEF can intentionally and specifically incorporate PHE response activities into
specific institutional HDP nexus commitments.
4.2 Objectives
The objectives of the LFE are as follows:
1. To provide an assessment of UNICEF’s response to the Ebola outbreak in Uganda vis-à-vis the
issues of appropriateness/relevance, effectiveness7, efficiency (including VfM), coverage.
connectedness8, coordination, and partnerships, with a specific focus on UNICEF’s level of
preparedness and the adaptiveness and responsiveness of the UNICEF response and how it
addressed issues for children, adolescents, and women, including those with disabilities and those
facing marginalisation and deprivation.
2. To draw out key learning and recommendations to equip UNICEF Uganda decision makers with
the information they need to formulate UCO’s transition from L2 emergency to long-term strategy,
ensuring the HDP nexus is in place and increasing preparedness for future PHEs, within the
guidance of the White Paper.
The evaluation team has prioritised learning and developing actionable recommendations that align with
global disease outbreak preparedness and response priorities, as well as with UNICEF’s White Paper on
PHEs. The recommendations have been collaboratively created with UNICEF. The evaluation has also
paid particular attention to integrated responses for vulnerable and marginalised groups and communities,
including women and children, persons with disabilities, and those with other vulnerabilities.
The evaluation has not assessed UNICEF's Post-Ebola Response Plan directly, but rather has reviewed
that Plan to assess the alignment with longer-term objectives. It is also intended to differentiate this report
from the UCO After Action Review (AAR)lxix, to avoid duplication of findings. As a result, the present places
a stronger focus on the perspectives of communities and external stakeholders.
7 The timeliness of UNICEF’s action is looked at as part of the ‘effectiveness’ criterion.
8 Connectedness can be conceived as the equivalent of the ‘sustainability’ criterion applied to humanitarian action.
18
4.3 Scope
In line with the ToR, the evaluation considers the L2 UNICEF Ebola preparedness and response between
20 September 2022 and 26 April 2023, across the nine affected districts, as well as some districts that
benefitted from preparedness activities. It assesses institutional, programmatic, and operational elements.
A more detailed description of the evaluation scope can be found in Annex 2.

5 EVALUATION DESIGN, METHODS, SAMPLING,
LIMITATIONS, AND ETHICS
This section starts by describing the evaluation design used for the LFE and the evaluation questions. It
then describes the evaluation’s methods, sampling, limitations, and compliance with United Nations ethical
standards.
5.1 Design
Following the evaluation purpose and objectives, the LFE is summative and formative, and the design is
realist-based, use-focused, and allows for robust analysis. Table 3 below lists the characteristics of this
type of evaluation. For detailed descriptions of the design, approaches, and methods, we encourage the
reader to consult the evaluation inception report.

merely answering the question ‘does it work?’ Here, the evaluators aimed to

against current Ebola priorities and lessons learned. Triangulation, made
possible by the use of multiple methods, data sources, and evaluators,
ensured the augmentation of the robustness of the findings.
The evaluation design is presented in Figure 5, which plots the three main learning questions proposed in
the ToR against the evaluation criteria of appropriateness/relevance, effectiveness, efficiency (including
VfM), coverage, connectedness, coordination, and partnershipslxxii lxxiii. The figure partitions the L2 UNICEF
response into three learning streams.
First, the L2 mechanism refers to the ‘whole-of-organisation response’ processes and mechanisms
needed to scale up a response. This provides data to assess whether the L2 mechanism and its processes
at all levels were applied and fit for purpose to ensure timely and effective scale-up (for example, resource
and partnership mobilisation, procedure application, and support functions).
Second, UNICEF’s operational response refers to the ‘in-country response’, and how response strategies
across the seven UNICEF response pillars were aligned to relevant policy/strategy, and how they were
implemented. Here, the evaluation aims to understand the extent to which UNICEF embedded its mandate

settings.
20
and corporate commitments to children in humanitarian response (for example, alignment and coherence
with the GoU response, coordination, leadership, and achieved results).
Third, the evaluation assesses the response from the angle of the ‘affected population’, and whether and
how they received relevant and appropriate assistance and protection as a result of the L2 response.
UNICEF’s organisational commitments to gender (inclusive of GBV/PSEA), human rights, and equity (age,
disability, and other vulnerabilities) are assessed as cross-cutting themes throughout the three learning
streams.
Figure 5. Evaluation design (Source: The evaluation team)
5.2 Evaluation questions
The evaluation team elaborated the three key learning questions outlined in the UNICEF ToR in an
evaluation matrix (see Table 4). To answer the three learning questions, 13 sub-questions were refined
with UNICEF during the inception phase to provide a clear structure and to enhance clarity. The evaluation
matrix specifies these sub-evaluation questions, sources of verification, and the methods used to answer
the evaluation questions (refer to Annex 3). In addition, in collaboration with UNICEF, priority areas for
learning were identified and integrated (refer to Annex 4).
The evaluation assesses several evaluation criteria from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development’s Development Assistance Committee (OECD-DAC). These include
appropriateness/relevance, effectiveness, efficiency (including VfM), coverage, connectedness,
coordination, and partnerships. However, the structure of the evaluation report follows the learning
questions: under each learning question several OECD-DAC evaluation criteria are assessed.
Learning Question 1 is answered using the above evaluation criteria and looks at UNICEF’s planning,
implementation, and results through each of the above learning streams (Sub-questions 1 to 8). Learning
Question 2 is answered by providing an overview of specific innovations that UNICEF applied in its
partnerships, digitalisation, and operations. The evaluation also identifies pertinent missed opportunities,
as well as the adoption of previously learned Ebola lessons (Sub-questions 9, 10 and 11). Learning
21
Question 3 is captured by Sub-questions 12 and 13. Across all sub-evaluation questions, lessons learned
have been captured, and these are provided in the last section of the report, together with conclusions and
recommendations.

programming?
Furthermore, the evaluation seeks to avoid duplication with the AAR conducted by UNICEF, although it
utilises the data obtained from that review. The LFE differs from the AAR in several key areas. The AAR
was informed by UNICEF stakeholders themselves, including the UNICEF personnel who coordinated the
operations. However, the LFE includes a variety of stakeholders, including an important proportion of
stakeholders who are external to UNICEF. This independence diminishes the potential for conflicts of
interest and bias that could not be controlled for by those conducting the AAR. The LFE therefore has
access to a much broader range of qualitative data than was available to those conducting the AAR.
The evaluation also gives special consideration to the human rights of children, focusing on key principles
such as non-discrimination, respect for the views of the child, addressing gender-based discrimination, and
ensuring equal enjoyment of human rights for persons with disabilities.
5.3 Evaluation methodology
A mixed-methods approach was employed in the evaluation, combining qualitative and quantitative
methods to gather comprehensive information (see Table 5). This approach allowed for cross-referencing,
validation, and triangulation of data from different stakeholders, overcoming method-specific limitations to
improve the reliability and credibility of the findings.
The evaluation team reviewed and analysed a total of 369 programme documents, including response
planning documents, work plans, the AAR, studies, and monitoring data. For a comprehensive list of the
documents that were reviewed and that are referred to in this report, please refer to Annex 5.
A total of 115 KIIs were conducted with stakeholders at international, national, and subnational levels. The
interviewees included representatives from various stakeholder categories, such as 21% from Category I
and Category II, and 89% from Category III and Category IV (refer to Annex 6 for details) 11. Specific to
Category I, there were 17% of stakeholders from HQ, 14% from ESARO, and 68% from UCO. Overall,
some 42% of stakeholders were female, versus 58% male.
A total of 27 FGDs were held with community groups and local responders in four out of the six visited
districts: Kassanda, Mubende, Kyegegwa, and Jinja (see Annex 7). There were 389 FGD participants, 42%
of whom were female. The evaluation ensured the inclusion of children’s voices through FGDs and play
activities. A total of 49 children between the ages of 14 and 18 participated in FGDs conducted in the
districts of Mubende, Kassanda, and Kyegegwa. This included 55% girls. Children were recruited through

schools, ensuring a gender balance, and applying inclusion criteria. Children were asked to answer six
learning questions according to a Likert scale from 1 to 5 (very much agreed, agreed, neutral, did not agree,
did not agree at all) (see Annex 8). Children were invited to fill in a grid, and were encouraged to be
transparent and to feel comfortable. There were no additional play activities. The six learning questions
were as follows:
1. Did the information you received about Ebola make you feel safer coming to school?
2. Did your school have running water, soap, and a thermometer at all times?
3. Did someone come to your school to speak to you about your worries and stress?
4. Did you at any time stop attending school because of the fear of Ebola?
5. Did you feel safe at all times at home during the Ebola outbreak?
6. Did you and your family have enough food at all times during the Ebola outbreak?

Having been informed of appropriate reporting mechanisms and sensitised as to culturally appropriate ways
to enquire into these sensitive matters, the evaluation team members queried interviewees and focus group
participants about potential Ebola response-related GBV and SEA. Efforts were made to include both the
elderly and persons with disabilities in community-level focus groups, and, given the granularity of their
knowledge of the makeup of the communities of which they were a part, VHT members were asked to
provide information on the various vulnerable persons and groups within their communities. Various
female-only FGDs were conducted over the course of the evaluation: these were led by female healthcare
workers from the communities.
A Community Rapid Assessment (CRA) was conducted to collect primary data from affected populations.
Through a series of 18 questions, asked via a mobile phone survey (designed by the hera evaluation team
in collaboration with UCO’s RCCE experts and implemented via VIAMO), the CRA gathered information on
respondents’ knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to Ebola. The objective of the CRA was to supply
both the evaluation team and UCO members with insights into community perceptions and knowledge,
which can be used to inform UCO’s subsequent Ebola preparation and response programming.
Sample sizes varied by district and underwent post-stratification weighting based on age, district, and
gender. The demographic breakdown for respondents was 67.5% male and 32.2% female, with 53%
23
between the ages of 18 and 25 years. The survey was designed to reach a diverse audience across ages,
genders, locations, and educational backgrounds (see Annex 9). A robot call was sent to an audience of
25,759 people, of whom 524 completed the survey (14.7% completion rate) (see Figure 6).
Figure 6: CRA (Source: UNICEF)
The CRA was found to be a valuable data collection and analysis tool for the evaluation but was not cost
efficient. The population-based phone survey findings enhanced the evaluation’s depth and
comprehensiveness, through providing an understanding of community perceptions on Ebola. It explored
beliefs, health awareness, help-seeking, and knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions on Ebola. The results
were stratified across gender, age, location (urban, rural), and education level. The CRA provided a crucial
step towards achieving a comprehensive, people-centric evaluation, enriching the evaluation assessment
with community insights and placing people at the centre of evaluation. Annex 9 provides a detailed analysis
of the CRA data and a reflection on the value of conducting a CRA as a data collection method in
programme evaluations.
The evaluation team conducted two participatory workshops to validate the findings and co-create
recommendations. Both workshops were attended by the ERG, an advisory group that included emergency
focal points and senior staff from UCO; however, the workshops did not include stakeholders beyond
UNICEF.

5.4 Sampling
The evaluation conducted stratified purposive sampling of key stakeholders for KIIs and FGDs identified by
UCO or local responders because of their knowledge of the affected communities. Snowball sampling
further selected relevant stakeholders to be interviewed. The evaluation inception report includes all
questionnaires, details of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the specific groups targeted for FGDs.
The CRA targeted individuals residing in the nine affected districts. Within those districts, a randomised
sample was selected using anonymised phone numbers generated from Airtel users. The total sampling
frame consisted of n=542, drawn from a population size of n=25,759. The subjects were recruited voluntarily
through anonymised mobile phone databases. The sampling strategy followed a random digit dialling
modality and the subjects who completed the survey received a top-up of 2,500 Ugandan shillings
(US$0.90) for Airtel airtime. The CRA questionnaire is available in Annex 8. The 19-question survey was
made available in three languages: Luganda, English and Rutooro. The survey was implemented at the
end of May 2023, after the field visits, to allow for further tailoring of the questionnaire based on insights
obtained through FGDs and other relevant sources. All data had been collected by 15 June 2023.

5.6 Quality assurance
The LFE was subject to internal quality assurance processes for all deliverables. Internally, hera reviewed
all documents to be submitted to UNICEF against OECD and Global Evaluation Reports Oversight System
(GEROS) evaluation criteria, norms, and standards. Externally, the LFE deliverables were reviewed by
UNICEF ESARO, the UNICEF Evaluation Office, and the ERG established for this evaluation process. The
ERG was established and chaired by the ESARO Evaluation Section and included emergency focal points
and senior staff from UCO. Its purpose was to review the evaluation milestones and deliverables, and to
25
provide feedback. In addition, hera facilitated ERG learning events at every stage of the evaluation, in which
the LFE findings were reviewed and feedback was provided. Revisions were then made to subsequent
report drafts at each round.
For quality assurance during data collection, the two evaluation leads served as the observers and
notetakers for all FGDs and KIIs, and worked with local researchers who spoke the relevant local languages
(Luganda, Kyegegwa, Runyoro, Runyakitara) and English. The researchers undertook a short training
session to understand the FGD and KII tools, and then translated English versions of the questionnaires
into relevant local languages. The training covered several topics, including an overview of the project, the
methodology and data collection tools, how to prompt participants, confidentiality and consent, ensuring
the comfort of participants, and the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) Ethical Guidelines. A review
of the instruments was conducted, involving a walk-through of the questionnaire guides, question by
question, an exploration of meanings, the best ways in which to approach the topics, and the objectives
behind the pattern of questioning.
5.7 Ethical issues
Ethical clearance was obtained from the Lacor Hospital Institutional Research and Ethics Committee, in
regard to conducting this review in an ethical and legal manner, with regard for the welfare of those involved
in and affected by the action (see Annex 10). This Committee was approved by UNICEF. The study protocol
was further submitted to the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology. Throughout the
evaluation, the team applied the principles of verbal informed consent, voluntary participation, assurances
of anonymity and confidentiality, data protection, the best interests of the child, and do no harm. Written
consent was obtained from children under 18 years of age, as well as from their parents or guardians. This
also included their permission to take photos. All recordings, interview and FGD transcripts, and survey
results have been de-identified. All data has been stored on a secure server. The participants were provided
with a minimal amount of cash to cover transport and snacks.
The evaluation team confirms that there are no conflicts of interest involving team members and UNICEF
and this evaluation (e.g. having received gifts, favours, employment, dealings with former or future UNICEF
members, use of UNICEF services or facilities, etc.) that would compromise the independence, impartiality,
and integrity of the team’s evaluative work. Each team member was sensitised as to culturally appropriate
ways to enquire into potential GBV/PSEA issues that may have occurred over the course of the response,
as well as to the appropriate reporting protocols if GBV/PSEA incidents were reported to them.
Equity was not mentioned in the UNICEF Ebola response plans but some of the UNICEF results indicators
included gender and disability inclusion. The evaluation included an evaluation question on gender equity,
alongside other principles and standards. The report includes a specific section on women, children, people
with disabilities, as well as other vulnerable groups.
Each team member was trained on and complied with the following standards:
 UNEG Norms and Standards for Evaluation in the UN System (2016)lxxiv.
 United Nations training programme on PSEA.
 UNEG Guidance on Integrating Disability Inclusion in Evaluations and Reporting on the United
Nationslxxv.

6 FINDINGS
The findings section presents the evaluation findings and consists of 13 subsections, which correspond to
each of the sub-evaluation questions in the evaluation matrix (see Annex 3). The evaluation matrix details
how each of these sub-questions have been answered using specific benchmarks, indicators, and evidence
from different data sources. It assesses 1) UNICEF’s achieved results, 2) adaptiveness, 3) AAP and PSEA,
4) women, children, and vulnerabilities, 5) response coverage, 6) adherence to standards and
commitments, 7) connectedness, 8) response efficiency, 9) innovative approaches, 10) missed
opportunities, 11) previous Ebola lessons, 12) age, gender, and disability (AGD), and 13) the HDP nexus.
6.1 To what extent did the UNICEF L2 response achieve its stated objectives in
terms of preparedness and response?
This section focuses on the effectiveness of UNICEF’s Ebola preparedness and response. It briefly
discusses results monitoring, followed by preparedness. After preparedness, each of the seven UNICEF
response areas are discussed (see Table 7 below).

Monitoring results
This section on results monitoring is intentionally concise, serving as an introduction to the subsequent
effectiveness sections. The evaluation acknowledges that while planned outputs and outcomes can be
used to measure effectiveness, it is essential to recognise that the Ebola outbreak was a dynamic and
evolving event. As a result, the evaluation has placed less emphasis on merely meeting set targets and
has also assessed what worked, in which circumstances, and for whom.
UNICEF had an adequate response monitoring system in place to track planned targets across various
pillars. The system provided a set of outputs with relevant indicators for result tracking and response
adjustments, as is evident in UNICEF’s humanitarian situation reports. However, the monitoring system
lacked comprehensiveness in terms of including outcome and impact indicators, and it underrepresented
UNICEF’s extensive array of achievements (outputs). Additional data sets were produced by UNICEF, and
these included the L2 monitoring framework, AAP results data, human resources trackers, dashboards,
regular humanitarian situation reports, and sectoral results (see Annexes 11, 12, 13, and 14).Some of the
data collection tools disaggregated data for sex, and age (children versus adults) but this was not
implemented systematically throughout all tools. While UCO was able to provide data on disability (people
reached) the data collection tools did not allow for systematic disaggregation for disability.
27
Preparedness
To assess preparedness, the evaluation used UNICEF’s Procedures on Preparedness for Emergency
Response. UNICEF is expected to ensure that preparedness is integrated across the organisation, and this
includes mandatory Minimum Preparedness Actions for Country Officeslxxxii.
UNICEF’s preparedness before the 2022 Ebola outbreak was not adequate. In 2018, the UCO had an
Ebola Virus Disease Contingency Planlxxxiii in place, considering Uganda’s proximity to the outbreak in DRC
and the risk of cross-border transmission. It must be noted that UCO was not required by the ESARO to
have an Ebola disease-specific preparedness plan in place, broader preparedness for PHEs was sufficient.
Additionally, there was a draft 2021 Ebola Preparedness and Response Planlxxxiv, which was incomplete. It
was only when the 2022 Ebola outbreak was declared that UCO focused on an emergency preparedness
planning process, which included developing multi-hazard preparedness plans covering droughts, floods,
refugees, and PHEs. It was then that Ebola planning figures were uploaded to the UNICEF emergency
preparedness portal, and this was used to update the Minimum Preparedness Actions, including the
standing capacity, staffing needs, and supply needs.
‘In every army you prepare for warfare during peace times. UNICEF doesn’t invest in emergency
preparedness during non-Ebola times.’
KII, MoH, Kampala
UNICEF’s strengths lie more in building relationships and creating platforms for CE than having
adequate preparedness plans, resources, and prevention and treatment measures for at-risk populations.
A 2019 surveylxxxv conducted by UNICEF revealed that only 13% of respondents believed that UNICEF was
somewhat prepared for an Ebola outbreak in terms of the quality of its preparedness plans. Several UCO
staff members confirmed that these findings had not changed regarding the preparedness status in 2022.
The UCO risk analysis conducted in July 2022 did not identify Ebola as a ‘very high risk’lxxxvi, despite
the WHO AFRO assessment categorising Uganda as a Priority 1 country for Ebola from 2018 to 2020lxxxvii.
UNICEF’s CPD identified Uganda as a high-risk country, ranked 15th out of 190 countries, for humanitarian
crises and disasters that could potentially overwhelm national response capacities, including the risk of
Ebola outbreaks12.
The transition from preparedness to response presented several challenges and various factors
constrained UCO in its preparedness efforts. Prior to the most recent Ebola outbreak, UCO had an
Ebola virus disease-specific contingency plan, contingency budgets, SOPs, etc.; however, these were
based on the previous outbreak and had not been updated. Moreover, many UCO staff were not aware of
them (due to staff movements, loss of Country Office institutional memory, etc.)lxxxviii. No partners were
identified for standby programme documentslxxxix. The lack of PHE plans for most sections resulted in initial
delays in designing the response and implementing critical interventions. The AAR highlighted that different
sections within UNICEF were working in silos due to the absence of sector-specific contingency plans and
budgets, leading to limited horizontal integration. Notably, the WASH/IPC sector did not benefit from
sufficient preparedness efforts, resulting in a critical shortage of supplies. Though RCCE was the most
organised sector during the initial phase of the response, with strategies and contingencies in place, RCCE
did not benefit from any funding. Moreover, the evaluation team found no evidence of previously conducted
simulation exercises that would have contributed to preparedness levels and facilitated a smooth transition
to the response phase. This lack of preparedness was evident in UCO’s insufficient stock of appropriate

Ebola personal protective equipment (PPE) at the time of the Ebola outbreak being declared, despite being
able to draw on some PHE supplies to support the response efforts.
UCO enhanced pre-existing core communication and coordination partnership arrangements with
MoH. In a swift response, UNICEF repurposed 15 vehicles, donated essential supplies (including tents),
and reallocated existing budgets. By 27 September, RCCE and WASH staff had been deployed to the
epicentre of Mubende. While some basic WASH and health supplies helped initiate the response, UNICEF
acknowledged that this was only the bare minimum. Both WASH and RCCE activities felt significantly
under-resourced and fell short in terms of response capacity. While some UNICEF members stated that
the organisation was well prepared, others said that they had not predicted the Ebola outbreak and were
not optimally prepared for such a scenario.
‘We didn’t anticipate it’,
KII, UNICEF UCO, Kampala
The experience and expertise gained during the COVID-19 pandemic boosted the initial response
efforts. UNICEF’s good reputation with the MoH and its previous Ebola partnerships contributed to there
being a degree of preparedness in place. Additionally, pre-existing structures, including those from the
COVID-19 response, proved valuable and were quickly reactivated. These included continuation of health
services as well as expanded Emergency Management capacities, both of which were
developed/enhanced during the COVID-19 response. These structures included the national and
subnational coordination mechanisms, response pillars, and the EMTs. At the subnational level, across all
districts, the VHTs were swiftly reactivated. The VHTs themselves stated that their knowledge and
experience gained from the COVID-19 response were instrumental in understanding the principles of Ebola
IPC.
During the Ebola response, UNICEF took measures to improve its overall preparedness and to
strengthen its partnerships. UCO increased its overall emergency preparedness score from 88% (July
2022–January 2023) to 92% (July 2023)13 (see Annex 15). Specific to Ebola, UCO enhanced its partner
mapping to identify existing, standby, and potential partners. UNICEF identified eight partners, out of which
six became actively engaged in partnerships14. UNICEF developed and regularly updated internal staff
mobilisation plans and surge plans for Ebola. These plans were aligned with the proposed Ebola work and
aimed to optimise staff deployment and resource allocation during the response. In addition to supporting
several districts in developing their preparedness and response plans, UNICEF provided support to the
Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) in developing a tailored urban preparedness and response plan,
considering the unique challenges and needs of an urban environment. UNICEF’s post-Ebola response
plans also included investments in further preparedness efforts at district level, including 11 districts without
active Ebola transmission. This is expected to strengthen readiness for future emergencies.
Allocating funding to preparedness and prevention efforts in general remains challenging. Funding
is often prioritised for more immediate and urgent interventions, which can lead to suboptimal preparedness
measures. Donors tend to prefer to invest in border control measures first, rather than allocating resources
to preparedness and prevention initiatives. Preparedness needs to be built into the resilience agenda
and to focus externally on government, as well as on UNICEF procedures.
‘Preparedness and prevention are a luxury rather than a necessity in the current funding-restricted
environment.’ KII, UNICEF, Kampala

UNICEF, under the leadership of ESARO, invested in regional preparedness. By 23 November 2022,
at-risk neighbouring countries, including Burundi, Rwanda, South Sudan, Kenya, and Tanzania, had
developed six-month pillar-based preparedness and response plans. These plans focused on key
preparedness activities, such as coordination, RCCE, human resources, WASH/IPC, supply, and resource
mobilisation. ESARO supported the different country offices in developing preparedness and response
plans addressing the various pillars, and coordinated with the WHO regional readiness teams. It further
convened a regional WHO/AFRO and Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ministerial cross-
border meeting on Ebola in October 2022. However, some key preparedness pillars faced challenges and
were not fully optimised. This was mainly due to delays in mobilising the necessary resources. ESARO
reported that preparedness activities under Scenario 1 were only funded for 22% of the required budget of
US$20,517,999. In particular, the area of WASH had a low overall preparedness status, scoring only 16%,
and experienced delays in implementing preparedness activitiesxc. The cross-border regional meeting
between African ministers of health was an opportunity to build on a child-focused regional response; if
more time had been allotted to this, more could have been done.
Response area 1: Coordination and leadership
As mandated through the CCCs and its EMOPS benchmarksxci, UNICEF is expected to play its part in inter-
agency and intersectoral coordination mechanisms for PHEs. Furthermore, UNICEF is mandated to take
on the leadership and coordination role in the GoU’s pillar efforts as the primary organisation responsible
for responding to a public health crisis, regardless of whether the cluster approach is activated or notxcii.
Under response area 1 UNICEF achieved 100% of its planned target (see Annex 12). UNICEF actively
engaged as an observer on the Scientific Advisory Committee and provided valuable technical assistance
to the NTF. As part of its leadership role, UNICEF co-chaired the RC and CE pillars, as well as the sub-
pillars of WASH/IPC, MHPSS, and CoES, in support of MoH and the Commissioner of Health Services,
Health Promotion, Education, and Communication departments.
At the subnational level, the organisation supported various pillars of the Ebola response and
preparedness plans of the nine Ebola-affected districts, as well as in another 11 districts for
preparedness. UNICEF played a pivotal role in providing technical expertise, facilitating coordination,
promoting harmonisation, and fostering collaboration among implementing partners, such as the DTFs and
the DDMCs. This ensured that preparedness and response efforts were well-aligned with national strategic
plans. UNICEF’s strong reputation, previous extensive support to the GoU, and previous experience in
coordinating the COVID-19 response greatly facilitated effective coordination and support during the Ebola
response.
In addition to the pillar and management structure of the GoU, UNICEF actively engaged with other
ministries and successfully advocated for the inclusion of both MoGLSD and the MoES to enhance a multi-
sectoral response to the Ebola outbreak. The GoU’s Ebola response efforts were initially primarily led by
the MoH. However, when cases were reported in Kampala, UNICEF further extended its coordination by
supporting the Kampala Metropolitan Area. All pillar leads reported positively on UNICEF’s level of
engagement, including as well as its inclusion of other ministries in the response.
National and subnational government officials generally expressed positive perceptions of
UNICEF’s support in leading and coordinating the Ebola response, which was seen as a valuable
contribution. They specifically highlighted UNICEF’s subnational support to DTFs and DHTs, in regard to
strengthening their capacity. The initial weaknesses in government subnational coordination structures –
including limited human resources, inadequate funding, coordination challenges, and lack of Ebola
30
experience – were addressed via UNICEF’s assistance in areas such as training, funding, and coordination
mechanisms. This support was seen as effectively strengthening what was previously lacking.
There were challenges in leadership and coordination at the national level. The presence of multiple
response plans and the various United Nations agencies involved led to occasional confusion regarding
roles and responsibilities, particularly between UNICEF and WHO. While WHO was the logical choice to
lead the overall response with MoH, given its commitment to the IHR and its role as the Global Health
Cluster lead under the IASC15, there were instances where the mandates of different organisations
overlapped, leading to some duplication and gaps in key areas such as SDB, IPC, case management in
ETUs, and community surveillance. UCO staff acknowledged that these challenges could have been
addressed if there had been stronger capacity of MoH to lead and coordinate the response, or through a
more coordinated approach under the United Nations Country Team. Some UNICEF staff noted that earlier
and more proactive participation by UNICEF in the process of revising the Uganda National Ebola
Response Plan could have clarified roles and responsibilities more effectively. While a workable relationship
was eventually established, and the outbreak remained relatively small-scale, concerns were raised about
the efficiency and sustainability of this arrangement for longer and more extensive PHEs.
‘United Nations agencies have realised it [PHE] is a cash cow, but we need one plan. Because money
hasn’t been used. It is something to be concerned about.’
KII, Category II, Kampala
UCO expanded its coordination hubs following the Ebola outbreak. Initially, efforts were focused on
two hubs in high-risk areas: the Mubende hub (Mubende and Kassanda districts) and the second hub
(Kyegegwa, Bunyangabu, and Kagadi districts). As Ebola cases spread to Kampala, Masaka, and Jinja,
three additional hubs were established. UNICEF reactivated the EMT structure, leveraging the existing
COVID-19 structures.
The support mechanisms involving UCO, ESARO, and HQ were generally perceived as valuable.
ESARO’s involvement before the L2 activation provided strategic and technical guidance to UCO, deployed
key positions (including an emergency coordinator), and offered remote and in-person technical Ebola
guidance. ESARO also supported on duty of care, the revision of existing SOPs, allowing the repurposing
of programme funds for the Ebola response, and support to setting up the field hubs. Subsequently, both
ESARO and HQ continued to provide support, offering funding through the EPF and the earmarked PSEA
allocation, as well as surge deployment of resources. Additionally, ESARO collaborated with the five
neighbouring at-risk countries to enhance their preparedness and to develop the UNICEF Regional Ebola
Preparedness and Response Plan.
Response area 2: RC, social mobilisation, and CE
In accordance with the CCCs and the White Paper, UNICEF is expected to reach communities with targeted
messages on prevention and services, encouraging them to adopt behaviours and practices to reduce
disease transmission and its impact.
Under response area 2, the response demonstrated a high level of effectiveness in the
implementation of RCCE activities. RCCE achieved 81.8% of its planned target and reached 6,215,797
people with accurate and culturally and gender-appropriate messaging on Ebola under the L2 (as shown
in Annex 14). Importantly, RCCE received the highest allocation of funds, constituting 29% (equivalent to
US$2,330,315) of the total funds available. It also accounted for the largest proportion of total expenditures,
15 Note that Uganda does not have an activated IASC clusters system.
31
reaching 49% (equivalent to US$2,035,935). These figures emphasise the investment made in RCCE.
Further, UCO was regarded as playing a pivotal role as a co-leader, alongside the MoH, in the RC and CE
pillars, working in collaboration with the Ugandan Health Promotion, Education, and Communication
department of the MoH. UNICEF employed a comprehensive set of strategies, including strategies on
Public Awareness and EC, Social Listening and Evidence Generation, Social Mobilisation, Stakeholder
Engagement, CE, and Capacity Building. The combination of these resulted in a strong whole-of-society
focus.
UNICEF invested in the most appropriate communication channels for RCCE. UNICEF invested in
mass media messaging through 29 radio stations and eight TV stations. The CRA showed that radio and
TV accounted for 56.9% (n=292) of preferred methods from both urban and rural populations, which was
in line with the findings from UNICEF previous anthropological studiesxciii. However, it is worth noting that
Kampala residents exhibited a higher reliance on social media (29%) compared to word of mouth (10%),
whereas the rural population relied less on social media (9.9%) compared to word of mouth (13.7%).
Women relied nearly twice as much (16.9%) on getting information through word of mouth than men (9.4%).
In contrast, tools such as banners, books, and posters proved to be less popular across all groups,
accounting for only 2.9% of responses. Considering the investment of US$235,918 in printed materials, it
would be prudent for UNICEF to reflect on the most appropriate and cost-efficient means of RCCE in future
PHEs. Furthermore, a review of information, education, and communication (IEC) materials indicated that
key messages were tailored and targeted to specific groups, including children and leaders (see Figure 7).
These messages were also adapted based on previous lessons learned from RCCE Ebola effortsxciv.
Figure 7. Tailored IEC materials
RCCE positively influenced public awareness. Broadly, most participants in both FGDs, including
children, and the CRA demonstrated a good awareness of Ebola symptoms, modes of transmission,
preventive measures, and the importance of seeking healthcare upon experiencing symptoms. It is
noteworthy that a significant proportion of adult respondents (68.5%, n=470) demonstrated knowledge of
the primary signs of Ebola, while an even higher percentage (84.4%, n=470) knew how to prevent
contracting the disease. Among the 49 children consulted during FGDs, 59% (n=51) agreed or strongly
agreed that the information provided made them feel safer in school, with no significant differences
observed between boys and girls in their responses (refer to Annex 8 for further details). Participants in the
32
FGDs and KIIs revealed that, at the beginning of the Ebola outbreak, there was widespread disbelief among
community members regarding the true nature of the disease. Many attributed Ebola to witchcraft or
believed that its spread was politically motivated. There were also rumours that people were using the
outbreak as a cover to exploit the gold mines and steal communities’ resources. However, when deaths
started occurring in the communities, this was the primary pivotal moment when community members
began to recognise and accept the reality of Ebola.
‘UNICEF had to break down such distrust [i.e., that witchcraft was the cause of Ebola] and UNICEF did a
very good job. This was UNICEF’s biggest strength.’
KII, VHT, Mubende
UNICEF’s strategic inclusion of a wide variety of local responders and community influencers within
the response proved highly effective in driving social and behavioural change within communities.
UNICEF engaged 61,585 key influencers in Ebola prevention and 1,292,547 people participated in
engagement activities (see Annex 12). The findings from the FGDs and from the CRA survey indicate that
VHTs and/or village chairmen were perceived as the most trusted individuals to provide accurate
information. During the Ebola outbreak, VHTs were formally financially motivated, this being a central
strategy of the draft National Community Health Strategy16. This motivation was critical for the pivotal role
that VHTs played for community surveillance, referral, and CE. Regardless of education level or residential
location, village chairmen and health workers were considered the most trusted individuals in communities,
with a 61% preference rate, followed by local members of parliament and/or resident district commissioners
together at 14%. Conversely, religious and traditional healers were regarded as the least trustworthy across
all age groups, genders, and locations, with a trust rating of only 7.3%. Further, individuals above the age
of 45 relied three times more on friends and neighbours for trusted information compared to their younger
counterparts. In heavily affected districts like Mubende and Kassanda, VHTs and local members of
parliament and/or resident district commissioners were the most trusted sources, with trust rates of 78.2%
and 12.9%, respectively, while religious leaders and healers only had a trust rating of 2%. However, it is
important to note that some traditional healers expressed concerns regarding the trade-off between the
advantages of being a member of the DTF and the negative impact on their business. To address this, they
suggested equipping them with temperature guns to enable continued consultations with clients who do not
have a fever.
‘Most valuable in terms of impact was CE by the VHTs going from household to household.’
FGD, DTF, Jinja
Teachers played a critical role as positive influencers for children and their families, effectively
transmitting key messages. From the FGDs with schoolchildren (14–18 years of age) it became clear
that these children received most of their information on Ebola from school. Most children easily answered
questions on Ebola signs, preventive measures, and treatment-seeking. Children also conveyed these
learnings from school to their families at home. That said, while 61% of children stated that the key
messages improved their understanding of the disease, 75% reported that they did not feel safe.
Although VHTs demonstrated exceptional commitment to the wellbeing of their communities and
were described as the bedrock of the health system, they faced several challenges that impacted
safe and timely referral. One important aspect was their contribution to early Ebola notification and non-
Ebola referral. However, VHTs encountered multiple issues, including the lack of transport during lockdown.
This regularly resulted in delays of several days before suspect Ebola cases reached health facilities. Also,
16 GoU (2022) National Community Health Strategy.
33
for non-Ebola illnesses transport was reported to be insufficiently available. With the halt on local transport,
VHTs could only rely on ambulances, and these were not always readily available, in particular in remote
areas. There were also numerous reports of VHT members being underpaid, not paid, or paid late, by
partners. VHTs reported unfulfilled promises in regard to receiving supplies, a lack of PPE for some at the
beginning and others throughout the whole response, receiving incorrect materials, and experiencing social
stigmatisation. However, the fact that VHTs were to be paid at all was significant for the formalisation and
launch of the Community Health Strategy after the outbreak. There are also questions on long-term impact.
While the engagement of these first responders has undoubtedly strengthened their capacity and indirectly
enhanced the primary healthcare systemxcv, VHTs reported that they are mostly inactive as community
healthcare providers. They reported that they only get activated and renumerated during emergencies. This
calls into question their role as comprehensive community health providers, and is also counterproductive
in regard to them becoming an integral part of a sustainable ‘readiness early detection and surveillance
system’ for future PHEs.

FGD, VHTs, Kassanda
The GoU’s division of RCCE into the separate pillars of RC and CE during the COVID-19 pandemic
had a notable impact on the Ebola response, but mostly at the national level. The decision of the GoU
to split RCCE into two separate pillars, RC and CE – despite the fundamental principles of RCCE
emphasising the importance of a two-way dialogue between authorities and communities, and recognising
the significance of effective communication strategies and community involvement – led to several
challenges. Informants highlighted that this split was beyond UNICEF’s control, but there were suggestions
that UNICEF could have been more proactive in advocating for a unified approach and participating in the
development of the Uganda National Ebola Response Plan. Inter-agency coordination would likely also
have had more leverage in this regard. The separation of the pillars at the national level resulted in delays
in CE, as compared to RC, confusion on roles and responsibilities, duplicated efforts, the need to manage
two separate teams, and the requirement for separate funding and coordination. These factors added
unnecessary costs and some informants implied that this may have contributed to the maintenance of the
division between RC and CE. It is worth noting that, at the subnational level, the progress of activities was
not significantly affected by this division because at district level it was largely the same district staff and
community cadres who led this work.
UNICEF ensured that RCCE activities were data-driven. UCO effectively utilised various feedback
mechanisms, including U-Reports, helplines, the child helpline, and anthropological and social science
studies, to gather insights into communities' knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions. These inputs played a
crucial role in formulating targeted key messages tailored to specific groups. At the community level,
UNICEF CE officers actively engaged in discussions and conducted social listening exercises to identify
and address prevailing fears, misinformation, and disinformation. This community-centred approach
facilitated a more informed and effective RCCE strategy, contributing to the overall success of the response
efforts (see the section on AAP, p. 44). Further, this data also positively informed other sectors, including
WASH and education.
Response area 3: Community surveillance and outbreak analytics
UNICEF’s White Paper recommends ‘to invest in informed and better decision-making through data
systems that place women and children at the centre’.
34
In response area 3, UCO played a vital role in community surveillance. This was based on a request
from the GoU and was integrated under the Strategic Information Research and Innovation (SIRI) pillar. To
enhance effectiveness of the response, UNICEF provided training and support to VHTs in identifying,
following up, and referring contacts and suspect cases. At the beginning of the outbreak., UNICEF deployed
15 vehicles, which greatly supported early detection. UNICEF also contributed to the strengthening of alerts
management, supported training on active case search, and provided orientation to contact tracers on
contact tracing guidelines, tools, and the roll-out of Go Data17. Additionally, UNICEF procured IPC/WASH
supplies valued at US$230,000, specifically targeting VHTs involved in community surveillance. Many MoH
stakeholders believed that UNICEF’s surveillance support complemented the efforts of other actors and
interventions under the MoH-led surveillance pillar. There is no doubt that these interventions contributed
to effective and efficient contact tracing activities, contributing to timely response.
The new development of IOA was innovative and constitutes a best practice for future disease
outbreaks. Following a request from the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, UNICEF
took a leading role in establishing and supporting an IOA cell, involving multiple actors and pillarsxcvi.
Applying lessons and strategies from previous DRC Ebola outbreaks, the IOA was set up under the MoH-
led SIRI pillar, adopting a collaborative approach, leveraging transdisciplinary social science data, and
drawing upon lessons learned from previous Ebola outbreaks and similar diseases. The IOA functions as
an operational research unit that aims to conduct real-time systematic operational research collaboratively,
informing operational decision-making during PHEs. UNICEF further supported the IOA cell by providing a
dedicated space at IDI, donating 10 computers to MoH, and deploying two senior IOA specialists to offer
support, with one co-leading the IOA working group. National MoH stakeholders stated that this system is
currently being used for other disease outbreaks.
The IOA and Go Data informed disease outbreak decision-making. By mid-October 2022, efforts were
made to support data management by utilising the Go Data tool for contact tracing, which proved valuable
in collecting essential data to aid surveillance activitiesxcvii. Between October and December 2022, the IOA
cell conducted six studies and the results were presented across pillars and DTFs (see Annex 16). Some
of these studies were influential in shaping response decision-making. For instance, the health workers
surveyxcviii, developed in collaboration with the WASH/IPD pillar, revealed that health workers lacked
adequate understanding of Ebola symptoms and modes of transmission. Less than 50% of health workers
were able to cite the first symptoms other than headache and 74% cited haemorrhagic symptoms, despite
these only being present in 12% of casesxcix. This insight led to adapting training for health workers to
address the identified gaps. Another study recommended conducting a malaria Mass Drug Administration
(MDA) to reduce malaria mortality in Kassanda districtc. There was a high incidence of malaria in the
districts with active Ebola transmission. Reducing malaria incidence with MDA is beneficial not only in terms
of reducing other health threats and strains on the health system but also in preventing misdiagnosis, as
the symptoms of Ebola and malaria can overlap. In response to this recommendation, UNICEF actively
supported the implementation of MDA in nine sub-counties across Mubende and Kassanda. Over the period
from December 2022 to January 2023, a total of 181,579 individuals, including 406 persons with disabilities,
received the MDA interventionci.
Response area 4: WASH and IPC
The UNICEF White Paper emphasises the provision of WASH services for everyone, encompassing health
facilities, communities, homes, schools, and public places.
17 Go Data is an outbreak investigation tool that is used for collecting field data during PHEs, including for case
investigation, contact follow-up, visualisation of chains of transmission, and secure data exchange.
35
Under response area 4, UNICEF achieved important WASH and IPC outputs. As at 12 January 2023,
a total of 4,233 health staff had been trained on IPC18, 212 health facilities and 183 schools had received
essential WASH supplies19, and eight health facilities had received upgraded WASH and hygiene systems
using solar-powered motorisation (see Annex 12). UNICEF further provided mobile toilets and water tanks
for health centres and ETUs, and constructed two boreholes in Mubende district.
UNICEF expanded and adapted the WASH/ IPC response and covered new needs and critical gaps.
When cases were confirmed in Kampala, Masaka and Jinja, UNICEF supported the health facilities in high-
risk areas in Kampala, Masaka and Jinja (i.e. Mulago National Referral Hospital, Masaka Regional Referral
Hospital, and Jinja Regional Referral Hospital). In 2023, priorities shifted and unused funds (200 schools
had not been provided with handwashing facilities due to supply delays) were repurposed for the
construction of sustainable solar-powered pumped water systems at three sites (Kalwana, Kiyuni, and
Butologo).
‘It was a very big achievement. We were handcuffed, and they [UNICEF] gave us support, logistics,
training, support to 180 schools with water and soap, and trained teachers. They gave us thermometers
for screening the children, as well as in six health facilities they put water systems.’
FDG, DTF, Kassanda
UNICEF stepped up and filled critical gaps in implementing SDB. UNICEF covered gaps in SDB
capabilities by supporting URCS SDB teams with allowances, transport, and training. The socio-cultural
complexities associated with SDB in the context of Ebola have been extensively documentedcii and it was
anticipated that these challenges would arise during the response. Unfortunately, the coordination of SDB
– especially in regard to ensuring dignity – was a challenge, but only at the beginning of the response.
Misinformation about the SDB process led to burials taking place at night, without the involvement of family
members and often without the participation of cultural and religious leaders. These incidents could have
been anticipated and prevented. Additionally, a shortage of fuel posed challenges for ambulance services,
and SDB teams expressed dissatisfaction with their allowances, while some missed out altogetherciii. The
absence of death certificates for individuals who died in Mubende ETUs created resentment and objections
within communitiesciv. Some families exhumed their loved ones and performed additional cleansing rituals
after the departure of the SDB teams, who had been responsible for their burial and choosing where it
would take placecv. After the exhumation, UNICEF and its partners identified valuable lessons and ongoing
simulation of SDB, orientation, and mentorship programmes were implemented. These lessons were
derived from community feedback and collaboration with community health teams, which enabled the
identification and resolution of key issuescvi.
‘We had 18 deaths, but the burials were carried out in the night. So, something didn’t feel right, and the
government was hiding something. Later they [the community] accepted [the night burials]. The president
has signed an agreement with other countries to take our organs. Later we understood it was because
they wanted to reduce the large gatherings.’

Key structural limitations within Uganda’s healthcare system presented significant barriers to
successful outbreak response. According to WHO, Uganda’s healthcare performance ranks 186th out of
a total of 191 nationscvii. In Madudu, the epicentre of the Ebola outbreak, as well as in several surrounding

health centres, there was no running water and electricity when the outbreak started. UNICEF provided
water to multiple health centres over the course of the response through temporary fixtures as well as
sustainable boreholes.
UNICEF’s collaboration with WHO and other partners in implementing the IPC Ring approach during
this Ebola outbreak was noteworthy and should be documented for future disease outbreaks. While
the evaluation team has limited primary data on the effectiveness of the IPC Ring approach (see Figure 8)
in this specific context, it facilitated integrated and multi-partner responses. The IPC Ring approach bundled
WASH/IPC support and training, along with key RCCE messages and engagement with VHTs and other
community influencers within the Ring. It also included community surveillance and strengthened early
detection and referral. UCO staff recognised the IPC Ring approach as an innovative model. It is worth
noting that use of the IPC Ring approach has been previously documented in other Ebola outbreaks, further
supporting its relevance and potential effectiveness in similar contexts.cviii cix cx cxi

Response area 5: Case management
UNICEF’s White Paper Recommendation 9 emphasises the importance of making life-saving
countermeasures universally accessible, relevant, and acceptable to all. It also highlights the significance
of protecting children and their communities.
Nutrition
Under response area 5, UNICEF performed well in regard to implementing a variety of nutrition
interventions. These interventions included procuring and supplying 28,218 units of Ready-to-Use Infant
Formula (RUIF) for the ETUs, as well as training 845 DHTs and health workers so as to enhance district
and local health facility capacities to deliver Ebola-appropriate nutrition (see Annex 12). While national and
district officials, along with health workers, provided positive feedback about UNICEF’s efforts, the results
fell short of the planned targets, with only 38% of the intended RUIF delivered to ETUs. This can be
attributed to the overall low Ebola caseload of children. Looking at UCO’s interventions through a human
rights approach lens, UNICEF’s nutritional interventions should be recognised as an endeavour to ensure
that Ugandan children were able to enjoy their human right to adequate food and the nutritional elements
necessary to lead healthy and active life.
37
The process of integrating nutritional protocols and adaptations for children in the ETUs was
unnecessarily prolonged. While UNICEF was highly visible in the field, many NGO stakeholders reported
that access to RUIF and the establishment of infant and young child feeding (IYCF) protocols took
considerable, time due to cumbersome discussions and purchasing processes. The many challenges
relating to children in ETUs are well-documentedcxiicxiii and thus partners questioned how UNICEF had
institutionalised previous lessons about Ebola and IYCF. The nutrition sub-pillar under the Case
Management pillar was introduced at the national level later because of the need to identify specific
priorities for nutrition. It was not until 18 October 2022, one month after the declaration of the Ebola
outbreak, that RUIF supplies started to be utilisedcxiv. However, in October 2022, UNICEF took the lead in
reviewing the national nutrition SOPs for nutrition and Ebola. UNICEF also reported that, by 15 December
2022, Case Management for Nutrition faced a funding gap of 91%, which potentially contributed to some
of the delays.
Partner stakeholders also expressed a desire for UNICEF to advocate for improved Ebola virus
disease treatment more actively for children. The CFR in children was a very high 60%, compared to
39% in the general populationcxv, and some ETU stakeholders reported that children were somewhat
‘neglected’ in the ETUs, in particular at the beginning of the outbreak. There was a need for age-specific
critical care equipment and therapeutics for children. While there are no specific SVD treatment guidelines
for children, case management stakeholders from NGOs reported their belief that more assertive treatment
protocols for children should have been trialled. It was concerning that some children did not receive
treatment, and it was reported that only those who received therapeutics in the ETUs survived Ebola. This
was seen as a missed opportunity in managing a low-prevalence disease outbreak, but also hindered the
implementation of early-onset research that could have contributed to building the evidence base for SVD
in children.
MHPSS and child protection
Under response area 5, UNICEF reached 32,457 children, adolescents, and caregivers with community-
based MHPSS services and trained 570 psychologists, psychiatrists, health workers, and community
structures. Further, a total of 129 child protection case management interventions were carried out and
child-friendly spaces were established in ETUs, including play kits and training for health workers on
creating a supportive environment for children. Finally, 5,263 children and adults were able to access
reporting mechanisms for SEA.
UNICEF implemented a whole-of-society-focused MHPSS and child protection response. At the
national level, UNICEF collaborated with MoH and MoGLSD in developing MHPSS and child protection
guidelines for PHEs. At the regional level, UNICEF established a new partnership with MoH Butabika
Regional Referral Hospital, and this resulted in a referral system for MHPSS and child protection. At the
community level, UNICEF took proactive measures by providing training to para-social workers at the
grassroots level, enhancing their capacity to support affected communities. Simultaneously, the MHPSS
and child protection teams engaged with RCCE initiatives to craft essential key messages. Moreover,
UNICEF’s efforts in MHPSS and child protection targeted various sectors, including ETUs, communities,
schools, health workers, and government officials.
It is important to note that the implementation of MHPSS and child protection faced important
delays. While MHPSS and child protection were part of the UNICEF preparedness and response in
Uganda’s 2018 outbreakcxvi, these two sectors were absent from the 2022 National Response Plan and this
sub-pillar was activated later on. The objections from MoH regarding the deployment of non-health workers
in ETUs further hindered the timely integration of MHPSS activities, and delays were apparent in Mubende
and Kassanda. Other contributors to these delays included delayed funding (November 2022), lengthy
38
approval for partnerships, and delays in sign-off. Some partner stakeholders noted that MHPSS and child
protection trainings were conducted in late December 2022, and even in January 2023, after the Ebola
outbreak had been declared over.
The integration of child protection in the PHE response shed light on the pressing needs of children
in Uganda. Activating the MHPSS and child protection services highlighted the harsh reality of children’s
lives in Uganda, including vulnerabilities and issues of violence. This created a demand for such services.
UNICEF successfully advocated within MoGLSD to integrate child protection in future emergencies and
ensuring that child protection is prioritised. At the district level, child protection was integrated into
emergency preparedness efforts. The approach of integrating child protection in emergency preparedness
efforts aims to avoid waiting for a national-level response during emergencies, but the short nature of the
Ebola response, the need for sustained resources for MHPSS and child protection long after the PHE
response, and current funding gaps raise questions about how children will continue to access quality
services..
‘As a survivor I face a lot of challenges, but also the children were being discriminated against.
The children never attended school. Children missed out on schools and were discriminated
against – traumatising experiences for the children. The children hated school and stopped going
to school.’

Response area 6: Preventing and addressing the indirect impacts of the outbreak
The UNICEF White Paper and the CCC emphasise the importance of maintaining and strengthening access
to essential services, including health, education, and psychosocial support, during PHEscxvii.
Continuity of essential health services20
UNICEF enhanced the overall health service delivery capacity. At the national level, UNICEF provided
technical and financial assistance to MoH, including in regard to developing Ebola guidelines. In addition
to the MDA and the distribution of the long-lasting insecticidal nets, UNICEF strengthened immunisation
and reached 9.7 million children with the Polio R2 nOPV vaccine. UNICEF also provided high-performance
tents21 to six ETUs, which made it possible to segregate Ebola and non-Ebola patients.
The imposed restrictions, fear, stigma, and supply shortages had a negative impact on access to
essential healthcare services for many individuals. District reports noted challenges in access to
healthcare, due to the movement restrictions, limited transportation, and scarcity of ambulances. FGDs
revealed that fear of contracting Ebola and associated stigma were barriers to seeking healthcare for
populations. IOA studies indicated that in Kassanda 57% of women reported a change in the availability of
healthcare services for children, with 68% citing reduced availability due to transportation issues. Initial PPE
shortages reduced health workers’ safety in health facilities, and it was noted that they therefore refused to
attend patients. In interviews with health workers in Kyegegwa district they noted a decrease in outpatient
attendance compared to the same time in previous years, and in Kassanda they faced supply shortages as
supplies were repurposed to Mubende district. Movement restrictions also affected individuals with chronic
diseases. CRA respondents indicated that the main barriers to accessing essential health services were
money for transport (50%), a lack of trust in healthcare service delivery (44%), and fear of being stigmatised
by the community (4.2%).
20 UNICEF’s work to ensure the continuity of essential health services was an effort to ensure that even during the Ebola epidemic
Ugandans continued to enjoy the right to health and their corresponding entitlement to a health system that gives them the
opportunity to enjoy the highest attainable level of health.
21 Standard UNICEF tents were adapted to be more appropriate for Ebola care.

Continuity of learning
UNICEF contributed to ensuring continuity of education22, thereby actualising Ugandan children’s
human right to education. In the aftermath of a two-year school lockdown due to COVID-19, UNICEF –
in collaboration with MoES and MoH – committed to ensuring continuity of learning across different age
groups. The UNICEF monitoring framework reported 3,345 schools were provided with thermometers, 283
schools had functioning Ebola task forces, 193 schools had received at least one supervision visit from
MoES or the DEO, and 4,312 teachers and teaching staff were trained on Ebola prevention, early treatment-
seeking, and notification. Specifically, UNICEF provided home learning materials to over 12,468 primary
school children taking final examinations in Mubende and Kassanda districts, who were in home quarantine.
UNICEF followed up clusters of suspected cases in children in quarantine and ensured adequate monitoring
during the 21 days of follow-up.
UNICEF’s transportation to support students going in and out of districts was particularly valuable.
Transport was organised in and out of Kampala, Mubende, and Kassanda to ensure students could
continue their education and sit their final exams in a safe manner. This reached 5,185 learners. The
support was also extended to children in isolation by providing them with the necessary materials to
complete their exams in Rubaga division. Perceptions from FGDs with learners, parents, and teachers, as
well as from interviews with national and district authorities, were very positive on UNICEF’s efforts. These
results show that UNICEF was highly flexible, agile, and innovative in this regard, and demonstrate that
children can continue to learn during small-scale but important PHEs like Ebola.
Some barriers and enablers identified are relevant to future similar Ebola responses. In interviews
with teachers and school directors in Kassanda and Mubende districts, it was reported that school activities
continued but attendance dropped. Students in FGDs reported their fear of attending school, and that those
directly affected by Ebola faced discrimination. UNICEF worked with district authorities to ensure non-
discrimination and the inclusion of children in schools. FGDs reported that once the outbreak was declared
over, discrimination stopped. Further, movement restrictions posed challenges for teachers in reaching
schools, particularly in remote locations, and especially during the rainy season. In Kyegegwa, schools
were closed by the mayor. The CRA respondents highlighted that in potential future lockdown scenarios,
the desired support to address barriers to essential services would have to include government subsidies
(for water, electricity, and rent) (35%), cash transfers (32%), and food (13%). Ensuring continuity of
education services was rated low on the priority list, with only 5.4% of respondents including it.
Continuity of services
Cash transfer interventions were not executed as part of the response. UNICEF conducted socio-
economic impact surveys, but the results were released after the outbreak had already been declared over.
The GoU expressed reservations about using cash transfers, fearing they could discourage people from
pursuing their livelihoods. Furthermore, implementing cash transfers during a lockdown context was
deemed an unsuitable strategy, although it could have benefitted the post-Ebola intervention. UNICEF cited
a lack of human resources and funding as an impediment to carrying out cash interventions.
22 UNICEF’s White Paper recommends to ‘ensure that no child misses out on their education and that with the exception of
pathogens primarily transmitted by children, schools should be the last to close and the first to reopen’.
40
Response area 7: Logistics and operational support
In line with the CCCs, UNICEF should ensure the timely delivery and distribution of supplies and essential
household items to affected populations, partners, and/or points of use.
UNICEF’s logistical and operational support facilitated implementation of the response across
several pillars and sub-pillars. UNICEF was a core member of the Logistics pillar and supported the
existing government systems for procurement, distribution, and monitoring of supply by providing technical
assistance and direct supply contributions. One technical officer was deployed to Mubende and Kassandra
districts to work in partnership with MSF to set up the ETUs, including the provision of WASH and providing
technical support to districts on supply management and monitoring. The repurposing of 15 vehicles was
crucial to allow for early-onset contact tracing and case detection. Partner and MoH stakeholders were of
the opinion that, alongside RCCE and WASH, UNICEF’s supplies and its global procurement systems are
among UNICEF’s comparative advantages.
While stakeholders did not report many challenges within the logistics and supply sector, it is worth
noting that PPE was critically short at the beginning of the outbreak and initially teams had to rely
on COVID-19 PPE, which was not appropriate for Ebola. Supplying PPE was not solely UNICEF’s
responsibility. Also, supply was hampered by MoH instructions to use the COVID-19 PPE stocks first,
before importing Ebola PPE. Furthermore, the GoU’s centralised fuel systems were cumbersome and
decentralised stock would have benefitted from more efficient distribution. Working within the existing
government supply systems came with barriers. Procurement and supply systems in Uganda remain
troublesome due to manual and paper-based procurement and supply processes. These result in significant
stock ruptures at health facility level. Uganda’s slow adoption and use of electronic logistics management
information systems to support supply chain processes and functionscxviii was also reported to be a barrier
to efficiency.
6.2 To what extent was the UNICEF L2 response adaptive and agile in the light
of changing circumstances?
In line with the CCCs, adaptation is regarded as a standard for quality programming. UNICEF is expected
to collect and analyse data on the situation of children and their communities to inform planning, programme
design, corrective actions, and adaptation to changing needs and contexts.
UNICEF continuously adapted the response, and this maintained response relevance. UNICEF used
previous Ebola lessons, data, community feedback, survey results, and IOA to monitor and adapt. Lessons
included, for example the value of recruiting local influencers, and thus having access to local knowledge
and a deep understanding of the context. The best results were achieved through UNICEF establishing a
two-way communication modality with VHTs and other community influencerscxix. During the course of the
outbreak, several assessments further identified specific vulnerabilities and needs of populationscxx,
including on non-Ebola health aspects. Such results instigated the implementation of the MDAcxxi, and
informed how to adapt Ebola trainings for health workerscxxii and how to maintain health service delivery
during the outbreakcxxiii. UNICEF’s AAR also induced reflection on how to improve L2 processes and
response timeliness and effectiveness. Table 8 provides a snapshot of some of the most important
adaptations captured by the evaluation.

6.3 To what extent were AAP and PSEA embedded in the UNICEF L2
response?
UNICEF’s AAP and PSEA achievements have been benchmarked against the CCCs and UNICEF’s AAP
Guidancecxxv (see Figure 9).
42
Figure 9. UNICEF AAP framework (Source: UNICEF)
UNICEF was effective in putting the interests of children and affected people at the centre of decision-
makingcxxvi,cxxvii and in establishing system-wide mechanisms for preventing, reporting, and responding to
incidents of SEA.cxxviii
UNICEF successfully mainstreamed AAP and PSEA across all activities. Even though the concepts
and practices of AAP and PSEA are external to the GoU and are seen as ‘donor-driven’, UNICEF’s system-
wide prioritisation of AAP and PSEA clearly enabled their prioritisation in the Ebola response, in line with
its AAPcxxix and all-of-office PSEA strategic plancxxx.
Based on lessons learned from the DRC ‘fiasco’cxxxi, UNICEF incorporated and mainstreamed PSEA
and AAP across all activities. UNICEF ensured the prioritisation of PSEA and AAP with all implementing
partners and with community stakeholders. GBV and PSEA were incorporated into emergency
preparedness plans and were therefore easily activated. Under UNICEF’s development programme,
potential UNICEF partners had been pre-evaluated according to an SEA assessment, to ensure there was
no operational delay in terms of PSEA compliance in contracting implementing partner organisations during
the response. Although UNICEF endeavoured to provide PSEA orientation to all temporary staff who were
hired in response to the emergency, not all of them were oriented on PSEA before deploying to the
frontlines. However, many frontline workers were trained in PSEA; additionally, partners were PSEA-
assessed to ensure systems were in place to mitigate risks and response to allegations. Approximately
33,000 community members could access reporting channels for PSEA. PSEA was integrated into every
part of the response and PSEA indicators were included in every standard emergency programme
document.
The activation of the L2 emergency triggered the disbursement of US$500,000 for PSEA. However,
the funds did not arrive in the country until the end of November/early December 2022. While waiting for
these funds to be disbursed, UCO endeavoured to access flexible funding and worked with WHO around
PSEA and GBV. However, the two-month delay caused some interviewed UNICEF members to query the
cause for the delay and what that implied about the extent to which PSEA and GBV services were actually
prioritised within UNICEF. There was no doubt that the L2 PSEA funding was immediately useful: it provided
43
for a GBV Emergency Response Team member, capacity training, IEC materials, and the procurement of
dignity kits (e.g. menstrual hygiene supplies, jerry cans, soap, buckets, etc.) for SEA survivors and was key
to providing services. No incidents of SEA were reported during the Ebola outbreak. The L2 monitoring
framework reported that, under the coordination of the PSEA focal point, UNICEF trained 808 individuals.
Among them, 61% were female. The training sessions included staff, partners (including officials, CSOs,
and cultural and religious leaders), and volunteers. KIIs and FGDs with communities conducted in all visited
districts did not reveal high levels of knowledge on PSEA. UNICEF partners demonstrated a good
understanding of PSEA, but the majority of local authorities and implementers had limited or no knowledge
regarding PSEA or AAP. This raises concerns about the effectiveness of the training conducted in these
areas.
Under APP, UNICEF’s engagement with communities was particularly successful (see the RCCE
section). It was inclusive, participatory, and included several different methods of dialogue with
communities, to understand what their needs and concerns were. UNICEF supported the GoU toll-free
hotline that served as a feedback mechanism and an avenue for reporting concerns. Additionally, there
was a child helpline that was designed to handle child protection cases and that also served as an avenue
through which feedback was received at a national level. Feedback could also be provided via suggestion
boxes, the U-Report live chats, or calling in to community radio programmes. The U-Report chat bot,
developed by UNICEF, generated a cumulative figure of 33,208 users having accessed the bot between
September and November 2022, with 18,705 total responses (see Annex 17). The U-Report teams
responded in real time to the incoming questions and concerns through the live chats. Despite these
established avenues for providing feedback, however, many complaints came through local political leaders
– who were also the most trusted representatives according to the community. A significant majority of CRA
respondents (68.6% for strongly agreed and somewhat agreed combined) indicated that they knew where
to report complaints. Similarly, 68.9% (strongly agreed and somewhat agreed combined) were aware of
where women and girls could seek support if they felt unsafe or had been violated.
Although UNICEF maintained a high level of AAP, there is one aspect of accountability UNICEF may
wish to focus on for future emergency operations: greater accountability to the district
governments it supports. For example, the leaders of Mubende, Kassandra, and Jinja districts indicated
that they had no visibility on what assets UNICEF brought into their district during the response and, as
UNICEF left Mubende district without conducting an official handover or exit interview, they also did not
know what assets UNICEF had left behind. This raised issues of final accountability for them in the event
of an audit. There were also challenges in collaborating with KCCA. UNICEF’s funding went directly to
implementing partners and was not channelled through KCCA. This led to disputes, KCCA refusing to
provide access to communities, and ultimately to delays in the implementation.
6.4 To what extent were the needs and priorities of women and children, as well as
those with disabilities or other vulnerabilities, embedded in the L2 response?
This section captures the findings relating to two evaluation questions from the evaluation framework (see
Annex 3) and focuses on UNICEF’s prioritisation of women, children, persons with disabilities, and other
vulnerable groups. UNICEF is expected to ensure that vulnerable groups, including children and persons
with disabilities, benefit from a full range of UNICEF interventions that embrace inclusivity and diversitycxxxii.
Children
From the onset of the response, UNICEF prioritised children’s needs and vulnerabilities. These
efforts were driven by UNICEF’s identity and its principles, but also by the high prevalence of Ebola cases
44
among children (28%) and the elevated CFR for children (60%). At the national level, UNICEF’s advocacy
efforts distinguished its work from that of other partners, with UNICEF successfully advocating for the
integration of education, WASH, nutrition, child protection, GBV/PSEA, and MHPSS in the national Ebola
response, where initially that response had primarily focused on health. This also involved including
MoGLSD, MoH, and MoES in the response. Further, UNICEF supported the dissemination of the National
Child Policycxxxiii in KCCA in the Kampala area.
‘UNICEF has always advocated for children from the start, different from what other partners have
done. They excelled in providing context-specific support to children’s need across case management
but also across education.’ KII, GoU, Kampala
The response extended its support beyond Ebola, ensuring that services remained safe and child-
friendly, even in ETUs. Additionally, there are indications that the response focused on maintaining
immunisation, antenatal care, safe delivery, and integrated community case management. The MDA
protected children from malaria, with 16,359 children receiving MHPSS services, and 129 child survivors of
violence benefitting from critical child protection case management services. Collaboration with MoH and
MoES allowed schools to continue operating safely, and no school transmission was reported after the
response started. Isolated children were accompanied to sit their final examinations, and UNICEF provided
safe transport for them. Notably, the district of Kassanda reported that the intake of exams exceeded the
intake in every previous year. UNICEF’s efforts also extended to addressing the specific needs of girls by
providing sanitary pads to ensure educational continuity during their menstrual periods.
UNICEF’s comprehensive approach was complemented with using child-friendly materials, such as posters
and comic books, to educate and empower children. Finally, through partnerships with organisations
working with child-focused approaches (e.g. Save the Children, AVSI, and LWF), UNICEF further enhanced
its child-friendly response. Together, these approaches contributed to expanding the coverage of specific
children’s needs and vulnerabilities in a PHE outbreak.
Children’s voices were actively heard through various CE activities. UNICEF played a significant role
in advocating for children in schools, fostering the inclusion of schoolchildren aged 5–12 and 13–18 in
debates, and recognising the best performing teams and individuals. Efforts were made to identify and
engage out-of-school children through dialogues held in open spaces and recreation centres. Notably, in
Kyegegwa district, this inclusivity extended to refugee and migrant children as well. Children directly
affected by stigma and discrimination were given opportunities to participate in discussions and received
important key messages. At the national level, UNICEF provided support for the child helpline. Although it
was challenging to consolidate exact numbers for children’s participation in the response, the overall
number of children reached during the response suggests that the participation efforts were successful.
The evaluation included the voices of children from Mubende and Kassanda districts. Overall, children
in the FGDs stated that they understood the RCCE key messages they received (61% strongly agreed and
agreed), the WASH/IPC support (91% strongly agreed and agreed), and the MHPSS messages (95%
strongly agreed and agreed). However, most children still reported experiencing fear when going to school
(57%), feeling unsafe at home (75% strongly agreed and agreed), and experiencing food insecurity during
the lockdown (51% strongly agreed and agreed). UCO highlighted the lack of funding for necessary basic
education and adolescent development interventions and the initial absence of allocated funds for child
protection and MHPSS. The UNICEF AAR also acknowledges the need to strengthen child-centredness
across UNICEF sectors.
45
Children directly impacted by Ebola were particularly vulnerable. They included survivors, orphans, and
those who had lost a parent. Despite the gradual decline in stigma over the course of the response, FGDs
with adults and children indicated that many children of survivors still faced discrimination, resulting in a
strong aversion to attending school. FGDs with children revealed that families that had lost a parent no
longer had the financial means to afford education. This recurring theme emerged strongly across FGDs
with children, adolescents, and adults. The evaluation team did not find evidence of a comprehensive
programme to support these children in the longer term.
‘My father passed because of the Ebola and now I am afraid I can’t go to school anymore.’
FGD, children, Kassanda
Women
The evaluation process emphasised the assessment of gender aspects in relation to the CCCs.
UNICEF’s commitment to integrating gender-sensitive programming in the response was evident, through
several factors. Needs assessments (e.g. the study of the impact of Ebola on sexual, reproductive,
maternal, and child health among women, youth, and adolescents in Kassanda and Mubende districts)
revealed the specific needs of women and girls. These assessments were conducted by the IOA sub-pillar.
In the response design phase, the operational plan included results and performance indicator targets that
were disaggregated by gender and by district. Several sectoral responses, including child protection,
MHPSS, and education, integrated gender-specific indicators. The L2 monitoring framework also
disaggregated results by gender.
At the implementation level, UNICEF integrated gender aspects across RCCE, education, health, and
child protection, focusing on women, adolescents, and girls. UNICEF’s efforts also focused on preventing,
mitigating, and responding to GBV. Strategic gender indicators and sex-disaggregated reporting were
incorporated into various documents, including the L2 Benchmark Indicator Matrix and the situational
analysis dashboards of cases, survivors, and health staff. Preventive actions and risk mitigation measures
were implemented to address GBV, including establishing feedback mechanisms. UNICEF also
mainstreamed PSEA. Partners, including CSOs, district officials, teachers, and volunteers, received training
on GBV risk mitigation in the Ebola response, with an achieved target of 99% (n=695, of which 57% female).
Similarly, 77% (n=808, of which 60% female) of UNICEF staff and partners (e.g. district officials, cultural
and religious leaders, and volunteers) were trained on PSEA (see Annex 12). Cross-sectoral RCCE efforts
included gender-sensitive messaging to address the specific needs and concerns of women and girls, and
messaging on how to access the available services. Up to 11 January 2022, 594 women, girls, and boys
benefitted from GBV risk mitigation, prevention, and response interventions. UNICEF also supported the
development, dissemination, and implementation of clinical guidelines for the delivery of infants of Ebola-
positive pregnant and breastfeeding women.
At the coordination level, UNICEF advocated for the inclusion of MoGLSD in the Ebola response; this was
a notable achievement given the vertical pillar management structure of the Ebola outbreak, which initially
only included MoH. GoU stakeholders acknowledged the initial lack of integration of gender, and more
specifically GBV/PSEA and child protection, in their response plan, and it took UNICEF some time to
advocate for the inclusion of these interventions. UNICEF developed a strategy to engage with the GoU on
GBV/PSEA, but completion of the draft strategy remains pending. Additionally, UCO and ESARO staff
reported that the importance of PSEA and GBV still needs greater visibility and recognition within UCO.
The outbreak of Ebola and the implementation of lockdown measures likely led to an increase in
GBV cases. The lockdown posed challenges in regard to accessing services and, as a result, some cases
may have gone unreported or not received sufficient attention and support. Interestingly, during FGDs
46
women and girls shared that they felt safe from GBV/SEA. However, the DHTs and VHTs reported an
increase in cases of domestic violence due to the lockdown measures, along with knowledge gaps
concerning the Ebola viral load in semen and transmission prevention measures.
‘Men now were beating their wives because they now had no work with the lockdown and there was no
money, so they had stress.’
FGD, affected community, Jinja
Regarding UNICEF’s own Human Resources, the organisation’s HR management and leadership
development did not demonstrate gender equality principles. Only 23% of deployed HR were femalecxxxiv,
indicating a gender imbalance that should be addressed. Interviews with UNICEF indicated that in some
cadres there are fewer females than males. Also, there tend to be fewer females involved in emergency
work. There was an effort to deploy females in the response, although deployment was also dependent on
approval at the different levels, and on the availability of staff.
Persons with disabilities
The integration of persons with disabilities was not explicit in the UNICEF Ebola Response Plan, the Post-
Ebola Response Plan, or the AAP Action Plancxxxv.
At the implementation level, UNICEF integrated a Disability in Early Childhood Screening Tool as part of
the malaria MDA assessment in Ebola-affected districts. The programme screened children for disability
and developmental delays and linked such children to appropriate services. 406 persons with disabilities
were identified in nine sub-counties in Mubende and Kassanda. FGDs with VHTs and affected communities
reported that individuals voluntarily took responsibility for the care of persons with disabilities. Further,
through its partnerships with Save the Children and AVSI, UNICEF conducted additional deliberate efforts
to both identify and target persons with disabilities and other marginalised people. Overall, there were
efforts to integrate disability considerations into the MDA response. However, interviews with UCO also
indicated that disability interventions were also disrupted as a result of Ebola, and that children with
disability faced specific barriers like, for example, the lack of transport to get to school.
Other vulnerable groups
UNICEF’s interventions aiming to reach all of society contributed to the identification of specific
vulnerabilities. The organisation’s CE, child protection, MHPSS, and AAP interventions further identified
other vulnerable populations at ETUs and isolation facilities, and within communities. The media and IEC
materials also played a role in emphasising the importance of this, and UNICEF requested all partners
target vulnerable groups. UNICEF’s interventions reached all layers of communities, from national to parish
level, and this facilitated the identification of vulnerable people, including children with protection risks,
children vulnerable to malaria, malnourished children, refugee children, and those living in urban settings.
UNICEF also identified children and adolescents who were out of school, to ensure their protection, as well
as child survivors and those indirectly impacted by Ebola, including orphans, children that had lost a parent,
and generally vulnerable households.
While such groups were not discounted in the response, there was no quantitative data reporting
on the inclusion of vulnerable people, beyond children, women, and persons with disabilities. It is
also not clear what action was taken to correct this, either through UNICEF’s Post-Ebola Response Plan or
other longer-term planning. UNICEF interviewees stated that reaching vulnerable groups was not
considered in the plan, but other interviewees indicated that this varied across districts and pillars. For
example, in Bugogo subdistrict DTF members reached vulnerable groups through house-to-house visits,
while in Mubende district vulnerable groups were considered for, and received, food relief distributions.
47
Support provided to survivors – a particularly vulnerable group – was inconsistent and varied from
community to community. MoH developed a national programme to support Ebola survivors and
requested support for this from partners, including UNICEF. Of the 87 Ebola survivors,16 survivors were
below 19 years of age. The aim of this support to survivors was to sustain, care for, and support survivors,
as well as involving knowledge management activities for 18 months after the end of the outbreak.
UNICEF’s post-Ebola response plan describes the support to Ebola survivors through each of its pillars,
much in the same way as in the UNICEF Ebola Response Plan. According to the plan, survivors will receive
ongoing case management follow-up, as well as socio-economic support to meet their basic needs. In
Madudu subdistrict, survivors received food support, as well as psychosocial services and transportation to
the hospital or local health centre for follow-up consultations. In FGDs in Kassanda and Mubende most
survivors indicated that international organisations continued to check on survivors to monitor their health.
Many survivors shared with the evaluation team that they experienced significant ongoing health problems
(including in regard to their mental health), which hindered them returning to their previous occupations.
Additionally, those who had lost their businesses due to lockdown, discrimination, or their employment
being terminated by employers faced challenges to ensure continued livelihoods. Most survivors reported
receiving no support in terms of livelihoods, and they were all concerned about how they would provide
food for their families and pay for their children’s school fees in the future. However, a minority mentioned
receiving non-food items and food packages that assisted them in reintegrating into their lives after Ebola.
The majority of national government stakeholder KIIs indicated that the exit from the Ebola response was
sudden across agencies, and that support to survivors did not extend much beyond clinical follow-up.
‘They burned the shop and now all the clothes were destroyed, so she lost her business.’
FGD, VHTs, Kassanda
6.5 To what extent was the L2 response adequate and proportional in its
coverage?
Following the CCCs, coverage should be guided by estimates of people in need and is expected to be
balanced with the quality of programme responses.
UNICEF was in the right place. UNICEF’s coverage enabled the organisation to identify and respond to
the severity and scale of need among affected populations. Broadly speaking, both interview and desk
review data indicated that UNICEF’s geographical coverage was appropriate and proportionate to the scale,
urgency, complexity, and capacity of the response at the different levels (see Annex 13). UNICEF expanded
its coverage by establishing five response hubs, at national and subnational levels, which were adequately
staffed. UNICEF covered all nine Ebola-affected districtscxxxvi and another four specifically on
preparednesscxxxvii.
The organisation did not intervene in all pillars across all districts, but this approach was
appropriate as regards balancing coverage with priorities, operational constraints, and the capacity of
partners on the ground. For example, there were child protection and MHPSS interventions in Mubende,
Kassanda, and Kyegegwa districts but these did not extend to other districts, while the urban districts of
Kampala, Wakiso, and Jinja did not benefit from continuity of health and nutrition services – an appropriate
approach given the low Ebola caseloads there. However, where they were needed the most, in the districts
of Mubende and Kassanda, UNICEF operationalised all of its pillar and sub-pillar activities, including cross-
cutting GBV and PSEA interventions. Where no population coverage was achieved this was often due to
delays in response. The delays reduced the relevance of the response, and thus resources were
repurposed to the post-Ebola response. Some of the monitoring results provided good evidence of
population coverage. For example, 95% of the targeted people were reached with accurate, and culturally
48
and gender-appropriate messaging, 94% of key influencers were engaged on Ebola prevention, and 188%
of targeted children and adults had access to UNICEF-supported SEA reporting channels (see Annex 14).
6.6 To what extent were relevant standards, commitments, principles, and
policies adhered to throughout the response?
The CCCs describe how UNICEF’s programming should adhere to relevant standards, commitments,
principles, and policies to ensure a high quality of response. The CCCs, UNICEF’s Emergency Procedures,
and other principles have been used to inform this section.
UNICEF adhered to its core commitments and priorities in regard to emergency response. Alignment
to the recent White Paper on PHEs was evident in the sense that UNICEF assumed its role as a public
health player in strengthening primary healthcare through targeted health, WASH, and IPC interventions.
The efforts on the continuation of education were also clearly linked to Recommendation 5 in the White
Paper that no child should miss out on their education, and this was evident through the achieved education
outputs. The response was guided by the CCCs, and in particular the commitments relating to PHEs,
including ‘Children and their communities are protected from exposure to and the impacts of PHEs’. The
UCO assumed its coordination and leadership roles in support of national and local authorities in line with
the L2 emergency procedures.
However, some UNICEF staff reported that evidence and data generation should have been implemented
earlier in the response. UNICEF also faced challenges in aligning with its L2 emergency procedures due to
a lack of familiarity with the L2 emergency protocol (see the section on timeliness, p. 54).
While the Ebola response addressed most of the relevant operational commitments, there is no
evidence in the documents reviewed that sufficient consideration was given to environmental
sustainability. The CCCs highlight the importance of integrating environmental sustainability into
UNICEF’s humanitarian action to enhance community resilience to climate change, with support on this to
be provided by ESARO and HQ. However, the clause stating ‘whenever feasible and relevant’ suggests
that environmental considerations may not be prioritised in an Ebola scenario. Additionally, the UNICEF
emergency procedures do not explicitly mention climate or environmental approaches, leaving uncertainty
about the extent to which they were prioritised in the emergency response. Given the current climate
agenda, its link to global health securitycxxxviii, and the anticipated increase in emerging diseases due to
climate changecxxxix, the evaluation team thought it valuable to raise this.
Humanitarian principles, as well as the principle of doing no harm, were mostly adhered to.
Throughout most KIIs and FGDs participants indicated that UNICEF applied the humanitarian principles
appropriately, or did not mention that adherence to the principles was a concern. KIIs with some staff
indicated that UNICEF was too risk-averse, and that a ‘no-regrets’ approach was not sufficiently applied.
However, KIIs with UNICEF indicated that this was constrained by some of the delayed funding, which
pushed UCO to prioritise their efforts and resources. Some staff were unfamiliar with the idea of a ‘no-
regrets’ approach, while others indicated that this approach was not applied before the L2 was activated.
UNICEF’s ability to adapt and be flexible does, however, underscore that efforts and resources were
focused on the most urgent needs and vulnerabilities.
6.7 To what extent was the L2 response connected to longer-term strategy and
programming?
This section describes how the emergency response aligned to UCO’s existing development programming.
49
UNICEF connected the L2 Ebola emergency operations to longer-term strategy and programming.
The Ebola Response Plan did not explicitly connect the L2 response to long-term strategy and
programmingcxl, but when analysing its core activities UNICEF clearly adhered to institution-established
practices for linking humanitarian and development programming.cxli UNICEF built on local capacity found
both at the individual and community levels and strengthened established systems from the onset of the
Ebola outbreak.
During the L2 there were clear linkages to UNICEF’s development programming in support of the
SDGs. UCO provided technical assistance to MoH in finalising the National Community Health Strategy
2022–2025cxlii. Here, UNICEF’s advocacy for financial remuneration of VHTs has taken Uganda a step
further towards formalising the role and position of community health workers within the public health
system. Further, UNICEF supported the finalisation of the National IPC strategy, while also establishing
mechanisms for digital community surveillance. Specific to health, UNICEF supported the development of
guidelines on the management of pregnant and breastfeeding women in the context of Ebola. This was
disseminated to the GoU and integrated in ETU practice. Furthermore, UCO continued to advocate for the
approval of the Inclusive Education Policycxliii and the Early Childhood Care and Education Policycxliv, both
of which are currently awaiting approval from MoEScxlv. It also supported KCCA to adopt its Child Policy.
The construction of seven permanent solar-powered boreholes and five pit latrines with permanent drainage
in Kasanda and Mubende districts during the Ebola and post-Ebola interventions further showcases that
the Ebola-affected areas were left with increased water and sanitation capacity. These efforts during the
L2 activation demonstrated UNICEF’s commitment to integrating emergency response activities with its
long-term development agenda, ensuring that interventions addressed both immediate needs and
contributed to the broader SDGs.
Connections between the Ebola interventions and UNICEF’s longer-term strategy and programming
were not always apparent to the key stakeholders consulted by the evaluation team. Most interviews with
local authorities and hospital staff indicated that the physical resources that had been placed in the districts
and communities during the Ebola response had either been removed or consumed. A common theme
across districts and communities was that the improvements in the health system that occurred during the
Ebola outbreak could not be sustained and that now they were ‘left as before’. Health and education
personnel – at both the village and district levels – consistently indicated to the evaluation team that they
do not have adequate resources or support to respond to the next PHE. Many health and education facilities
lack sustainable water supplies.
‘We are not ready now because we have nothing. … We have few sanitisers, soap, even gloves. We start
from nothing. We have to start but we are really badly off, and we have to take care of it. When we have
an outbreak, everybody comes. When the outbreak is finished everybody leaves and we are back to
zero.’
KII, Health Worker, Mubende Regional Hospital
6.8 To what extent did UNICEF scale up the L2 response efficiently?
According to the UNICEF emergency procedures, an L2 activation is expected to mobilise resources
(financial, human, supplies, partnerships) to enable an efficient and effective emergency response.
Funding mobilisation
The L2 response successfully mobilised sufficient resources for the Ebola outbreak. UNICEF
reported having raised US$7,949,919 under the Ebola response, which was considered adequate for the
50
planned interventions. Of this, UNICEF received US$6.6 million from donors and utilised other resources,
including reprogrammed existing funds, totalling approximately US$1.6 million. During the active response,
81% of the received and reprogrammed funds were utilised, while the remaining 19% were allocated for
the post-SVD recovery period (a total of US$1,540,000). UNICEF’s contributions to the collective response
during the Ebola outbreak in Uganda amounted to 10%23.
Reprogramming regular and thematic funds enabled UCO to effectively respond to the emergency in
the early phase of the response (e.g. repurposing COVID-19 funds). This reprogramming of funds was
carried out before the L2 was declared and while initial discussions with donors about the availability of
additional funding and the reprogramming of funds were ongoing. This is to be commended as an enabler
of operational efficiency. UNICEF HQ mobilised US$925,926 from the United States Agency for
International Development under an umbrella grant that was available in the first week of the outbreak. This
was instrumental in accelerating the response, especially for WASH, and is a best practice that should be
considered for other outbreaks. Loans from the EPF of US$2.5 million for Child Protection and US$500,000
for PSEA (as per L2 protocols) contributed to operational efficiency. However, the US$500,000 earmarked
for PSEA arrived two months after the L2 activation.
Most of the funds received were spent on RCCE, followed by case management and WASH/IPC;
these pillars were seen as UNICEF’s comparative advantages by GoU and partner stakeholders (see Table
11). There were no reports of poor VfM specifically, but some of the delays in receiving supplies and funding
resulted in diminished relevance and therefore were interpreted as wastage. Examples include the
purchase of thermometers, IEC materials for schools, and WASH stations for schools, as well as the late
arrival of funds for PSEA, child protection, and MHPSS. However, such funds were appropriately
repurposed to relevant long-term interventions (e.g. permanent boreholes). The large proportional
investment in RCCE was perceived as fair in terms of VfM in an Ebola scenario – in particular, investment
in mass media over TV and radio – as well as all-of-society CE. In the education sector, the transportation
of students incurred high costs per individual. However, this decision aligned with the L2 principle of ‘no
regrets’ and UNICEF’s guiding principle of ‘acting in the best interests of the child’ (see Annex 18).
Economic efficiency
The Ebola response programme did not have pre-set budgets linked to output and outcome targets, and
this constrained the possibility of an economic efficiency assessment. However, efficiency is also affected
by the series of choices made over the course of the response and is connected to both the relevance and
impact of interventions.
The response made a significant contribution to improving efficiency and achieving the desired
results. The pillars of the intervention, in respect to relevance, results, and effectiveness, were well
designed and aligned with the context. The interventions were feasible, and the resources allocated were
effectively converted into tangible outcomes. No apparent waste or misuse of funds was reported. Table 9
provides a summary of the good choices made, demonstrating how budgets were effectively translated into
direct outcomes and impacts.
Table 9. UCO economic efficiency indications, September 2022–March 2023 (Source:
UNICEFcxlvi,cxlvii)
Supporting observations:
 Over 85% of the funds UCO received were spent on operations.
23 Ebola Virus Disease Outbreak Response Accountability Forum, 10 January 2023.
51
 Almost 35% of the operational funds were dedicated to RCCE, which made it the most
expensive component of the intervention. However, between October and December 2022,
Ebola campaigns were aired on 47 radio stations, reaching 10.5 million people. During that
same timeframe, 8.1 million people were reached via Ebola campaigns on TV (seven
stations). Given the extensive reach of the targeted messages on prevention and services,
resulting in the engagement of persons to reduce the transmission of Ebola and the proven
impact of such an approach, the efficiency of the decision to dedicate 35% of operational
resources to this pillar seems indisputable.
 23% of the operational funds went to the Case Management pillar; however, nearly 50% of
that expense was used to procure RUIF and nutrition commodities. There is no questioning
the impact of this life-saving nutritional intervention. That said, only 38% of RUIF ended up
being supplied to ETUs (although this is mostly attributed to the overall low Ebola caseload
among children).
 15% of funds went to CoES. Out of this budget, 12,468 learners were transported within and
out of restricted districts, and health officials indicated that this contributed to a record level
of learners sitting their national exams. The impact of this expense on the lives of the learners
who benefitted from this intervention is evident.
Timeliness
The issue of earlier L2 activation, and its potential benefits for a timely response, elicited
contrasting opinions. There was a notable 36-day gap between the declaration of the Ebola outbreak and
the activation of the L2. This delay is particularly significant given that virus transmission was halted within
69 days and the outbreak was controlled within 113 days. It is worth mentioning that the L2 activation
occurred on 27 October 2022, 16 days after the first cases in Kampala were registered and 27 days after
the epidemiological peak (see Annex 19). The delay in L2 activation was partly attributed to UCO’s lack of
familiarity with the procedures and, according to UNICEF staff, some political resistance, despite WHO
having declared an L3 emergency the day after the outbreak was declared. While some argued that an
earlier activation would have been advantageous, particularly in addressing delays in HR and supplies, the
impacts of these delays were primarily felt at the subnational level.
Nonetheless, UNICEF had already initiated its response prior to the L2 activation and received
support from ESARO in terms of reallocation of funds, deployment of personnel, and adaptation of regular
programme procedures. This enabled UNICEF to swiftly repurpose vehicles, procure necessary supplies,
and commence support at the national level within seven days of the Ebola outbreak declaration (see Annex
19)
Irrespective of the timing of the L2, the response efforts were adversely affected by delays, resulting
in diminished relevance. Delays to interventions were mostly due to delays in receiving funding, HR, and
supplies, and these were identified in UNICEF KIIs and UNICEF’s AAR report. These challenges were
reported across all pillars and levels of the response, albeit to a varying degree. One delay was observed
in the deployment for RCCE, which took almost a month. Internal delays in the development of, and
approval process for, child protection programme documents, and also funding disbursements towards
MHPSS and child protection, limited UNICEF’s ability to provide timely interventions. MHPSS and PSEA
staffing and funding support were only available towards the end of the response.
HR
UNICEF mobilised a total of 98 staff members, including personnel from UCO, ESARO, HQ, and
locally recruited individuals. The deployment of surge personnel, combined with the timely repurposing
52
of eight UCO individuals within the response, contributed to initial operational efficiency, as did the
deployment of an ERT Emergency Coordinator before the L2 activation. External staff started arriving in
mid-October 2022 (n=17), but most arrived in November 2022 (n=23). UNICEF’s HR tracking sheet showed
that there were delays in deployments, and this was most apparent at subnational level, with some UNICEF
staff indicating that it took one month from the Ebola outbreak declaration to have sufficient UNICEF staff
in the field. There were challenges in terms of implementing the accelerated timelines for approval of
emergency recruits and the timely appointment of temporary staff (despite the fact that UCO had a list of
potential consultants from the COVID-19 response). The deployment of an ERT HR specialist (as per the
L2 protocols) would have improved efficiency in this area and could have enabled UCO to keep pace with
staffing needs. The delays in temporary appointments were caused by the need to apply an appropriate
level of insurance, given the nature of Ebola (see Annex 20).
Duty of care
Regarding duty of care, UCO prioritised the safety and wellbeing of its staff. Ebola prevention protocols
effectively protected all UNICEF staff from infection. Comprehensive briefings were provided by relevant
personnel. UCO was fully aware of the considerable stress associated with Ebola response operations,
particularly in Uganda, where no Ebola vaccine was available. Protocols were implemented to allow regular
rest and recuperation for staff, preventing burnout.
Both the UCO staff interviewed and the AAR pointed to some weaknesses in this area. The duty of care
was primarily focused on field staff, and Kampala staff received comparatively less attention. Additionally,
living conditions for those working in the field were reported to be below acceptable standards, as
highlighted by UNICEF staff at subnational levels. Some facilities lacked safe drinking water and electricity,
while repairs were needed in locations where UCO personnel stayed, which led to several staff members
falling ill. Although their resilience during the emergency is commendable, it is evident that more could have
been done to ensure acceptable accommodation for UCO personnel working in or visiting the field.
Partnerships
Many within UCO were unfamiliar with UNICEF’s Emergency Procedurescxlviii on partnerships. The
potential implementing partners were not identified through the Minimum Preparedness Actions, and
contingency programme documents were not signed. Still, UNICEF efficiently leveraged its COVID-19
partnerships in its Ebola response and established partnerships with seven partners24, in parallel to its
existing partnership with the GoU. Similarly, although PSEA assessments had been conducted for all CSO
partners – a significant enabler of efficiency – UCO personnel were largely unfamiliar with/unable to action
UNICEF emergency procedures that simplified and streamlined the process so as to establish and
implement partnership agreements in an expedited manner. Several reports from the AAR, as well as from
FGDs with local responders, confirmed that funding transfers came in late. Implementing partners also
indicated that some delays in funding were caused by their own organisations.
UNICEF forged partnerships with NGOs that have experience in implementing child-friendly
approaches, enabling the integration of MHPSS through collaboration with organisations like Butabika
Regional Referral Hospital, as well as child protection through partnerships with AVSI and Save the
Children. These organisations also had established mechanisms for AAP and PSEA, which facilitated the
seamless integration of these cross-cutting approaches. Collaborating with the Red Cross facilitated swift
connections with communities at the grassroots level. Some of these partnerships were pre-existing, and
UNICEF’s engagement with local responders and community influencers supported a whole-of-society
focus.

Advocacy
UNICEF’s advocacy efforts played an important role in promoting child-friendly policies and
practices and addressed crucial programming gaps. At the country level, these efforts consistently
prioritised the best interests of children, and GoU and partner stakeholders reported that UNICEF emerged
as the primary ‘child-focused’ advocate in the response. Notable accomplishments include the IYCF
practices for ETUs, the integration of child protection and MHPSS, working with survivors to support
children in ETUs, sex disaggregation in ETUs and isolation units, and the inclusion of MoGLSD and MoES
in the Ebola response. Furthermore, UNICEF, in collaboration with the GoU, actively participated in the
development of national-level strategies (e.g. the Uganda Community Health Strategy and the Uganda IPC
Strategy) that will yield long-term benefits. The research supported by UNICEF (e.g. studies conducted by
the IOA and anthropological studies) provided valuable evidence to inform decision makers.
6.9 What innovative approaches were used that could be leveraged in the
continued response?
To inform the section below, the evaluation applied UNICEF’s definitioncxlix of ‘innovation’.
The approaches listed below were identified based on qualitative assessments and feedback gathered from
various stakeholders, as well as on observations and discussions conducted with affected populations. The
evaluation team believe that the innovations listed in the table yielded positive results or, at the very least,
are worth documenting for future adaptation and scale-up in similar scenarios. The table provides an
overview of innovative approaches, activities, and models that could be leveraged in similar and other future
PHEs.

6.10 To what extent were there missed opportunities and gaps?
While UNICEF demonstrated many commendable efforts, the evaluation identified gaps and missed
opportunities that should be leveraged in future PHEs. These include a lack of proactive advocacy for policy
translation and coordination, the need to clarify roles in PHEs between United Nations agencies, the need
to implement cash grants to reduce secondary impact of epidemics and their movement restrictions, the
need for early onset collection of child-specific data, and the need for child-focused research to build the
evidence base of emerging diseases. Incorporating these insights can enhance UNICEF’s preparedness
and response strategies for future Ebola outbreaks, fostering more effective, inclusive, and agile
interventions. Annex 21 provides an overview of these specific missed opportunities.
6.11 To what extent were lessons learned from previous outbreaks and
preparedness measures applied in this response?
In general, UNICEF applied previous and relevant Ebola lessons that are relevant to its mandate in PHEs.
Annex 22 includes specific lessons from UNICEF’s experiencecl, but also collective lessonscli. The lessons
captured are those that are aligned to the UNICEF White Paper on PHEs and a red-amber-green rating is
appliedclii. Readers are encouraged to review this section with the above sections on innovations and
missed opportunities (section 6.9 and 6.10)
At the time of the Ebola outbreak declaration, UCO had limited national capacity with Ebola expertise on
the ground. The office was reported to have experienced rapid staff turnover and new staff did not review
or learn from previous Ebola outbreaks. There were no reports of annual simulations or training to keep
Ebola knowledge and information institutionalised in UCO. There was also a lack of familiarity with L2
emergency procedures, which further reduced the capacity of UCO to activate such procedures quickly and
accurately. Evident lessons that should have been adopted at the beginning of the outbreak included, for
example, the need to integrate child protection and MHPSS. These are UNICEF’s core business but they
were also highlighted in previous UNICEF Ebola lessons. However, other valuable previous Ebola lessons
were indeed adopted and added significant value to the response, including the strong focus on CE,
including the integration of local influencers and responders in the response. Also, the model of IOA was
adopted from the previous DRC Ebola outbreak and added value to the Uganda response.
6.12 What mechanisms/systems should UCO adapt and put in place to ensure
agility and to prepare for the immediate future, adjusting to the changing context
and different age-, gender-, and disability-related needs of women and children?
Table 11 outlines specific age-, gender-, and disability-related (AGD-related) needs of women and children
derived from the findings. The table provides action points that can strengthen the transition from the Ebola
response to longer-term programming. These action points are complementary to Outcome 2.1cliii and 2.2cliv
of the Uganda CPDclv.

6.13 How can UCO integrate emergency response into the HDP nexus?
This section differs from Section 6.7 as it focuses on the emergency response in relation to the HDP nexus.
UNICEF’s Procedure Linking Humanitarian and Development Programmingclvi recommends that UNICEF’s
emergency interventions should be linked with development and peacebuilding actions, while strengthening
collaboration, coherence, and complementarity among actors.clvii
While UCO’s emergency response contributed to collective Ebola outcomes and strengthened the
capacities of local partners, the UNICEF Ebola Response Plan did not clearly integrate HDP nexus
procedures. UNICEF’s HDP nexus procedure revolves around reducing overall vulnerability and needs by
addressing root causes through risk informed, multi-partnership programmes. Nexus-informed programmes
typically strive to accomplish these collective outcomes via joined-up interventions between humanitarian
and development programming. The evaluation also found that understanding of the HDP nexus among
Category I and Category II stakeholders was nebulous. Still, there were several indicative examples of
adjustments that were made during the implementation of response activities that strengthened the linkages
between humanitarian and development programming. The table below lists achievements on HDP nexus
linkages and provides guidance on how UNICEF can integrate emergency response into the HDP nexus.

Achieved: Along with other actors, UNICEF conducted a joint analysis
of the Ebola outbreak, and gender and related risks were considered
in this analysis.
Gaps to be addressed: The analysis was disease-specific and lacked

improvement in integrating preventive measures into the CPD and

preventive perspectives must be incorporated into collective
outcomes.
Achieved: UCO’s Ebola response implementation demonstrated a
shared vision and collaborative programming. It empowered the GoU
by supporting their leadership and coordinating not only with United
Nations leaders but also local and national authorities (e.g. MoH,
MoES, MoGLSD, DTFs, VHTs, etc.). The UNICEF Ebola Response
Plan aligned with the National Ebola Response Plan, served as a
common framework, and contributed to activities that were agreed

implementation Gaps to be addressed: As an emergency, disease-specific response,
there should be collective outcomes across the humanitarian and
development responses. The response did not align incremental steps
within a multi-year timeframe towards achieving specific SDGs.
Preparedness measures did not prioritise prevention and did not
adequately address underlying needs, structural drivers, and
vulnerabilities, and nor did they aim to bring about meaningful changes
in the status quo.
Achieved: UCO demonstrated effective funding allocation by directing

resources towards implementing partners.
57
Gaps to be addressed: Despite UCO's admirable efforts, the
repurposing of existing funds in the early response phase did not align
with HDP nexus funding and financing benchmarks. The evaluation
team found that the funding received for the Ebola response lacked
predictability and multi-year coverage, with flexibility varying among
donors. The funding for Ebola operations was not consistently flexible,
unearmarked, or aligned with transition plans, leaving uncertainty
regarding its coverage for the 180-day post-Ebola transition plan.

7 CONCLUSIONS, LESSONS LEARNED, AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
7.1 Conclusions
The conclusions are drawn primarily from the evaluation findings. This section is structured along the key
recurring themes that are relevant to UNICEF’s White Paper on PHEs. Each conclusion uses a red-amber-
green rating indicating the status of the conclusions. Red indicates that there were significant issues,
delays, or problems with the intervention. Amber (yellow) signifies that there were some concerns or risks
that needed attention, and that there were certain aspects of the intervention that would have been at risk
if they were not addressed promptly. Green indicates that everything progressed as planned and there were
no major concerns or risks.
Conclusion 1: UCO’s in-country preparedness was not sufficiently relevant an Ebola outbreak and
did not allow for an efficient transition to the Ebola response. Despite it not being a country requirement
to have disease-specific preparedness plans in place, a contingency plan existed, from the previous Ebola
outbreak in 2018. The draft 2021 Ebola Preparedness and Response Plan was found to be incomplete,
exposing gaps in the organisation's readiness. Insufficient funding dedicated to preparedness activities
compounded the challenges, hindering the establishment of partnerships, contingency plans, and
contingency budgets, and the procurement of essential Ebola supplies. This also limited the horizontal
integration necessary for a unified pillared response. The transition from preparedness to response was
challenging due to some of the gaps in preparedness, and also due to a lack of familiarity with L2 emergency
procedures and insufficient numbers of staff with Ebola expertise. Nonetheless, as the Ebola response
progressed, UNICEF demonstrated adaptiveness and responsiveness, improving its preparedness
measures. It effectively mitigated some of these shortcomings by repurposing programme funds and
resources, and deploying UCO programme staff and staff from ESARO with Ebola expertise. In parallel,
efforts by ESARO to invest in regional preparedness across neighbouring countries demonstrated the
importance of potential cross-border spread of Ebola. However, the limited funding available only covered
22% of the required budget, raising questions about the extent to which donors are committed to funding
prevention efforts.
Conclusion 2: UNICEF’s leadership and coordination were mostly effective in ensuring the
response was coherent. UNICEF demonstrated commendable leadership and engagement in
coordinating response activities at both national and subnational levels. UNICEF’s active engagement and
its leadership role in co-chairing the RCCE pillars, as well as the sub-pillars of WASH and IPC, MHPSS,
and CoES, demonstrated the value of its technical assistance. The GoU split the RCCE pillar into two
separate pillars (RC and CE) and this uncommon division produced gaps and duplication among
responding agencies in the early weeks of the response. By fostering collaboration among various local
responders, such as the DTFs and DDMCs, UNICEF effectively aligned preparedness and response efforts
with national strategic plans. Moreover, UNICEF expanded its reach and collaboration during the response
by advocating for the inclusion of MoGLSD and MoES to promote a more multi-sectoral response to the
outbreak. This inclusive approach enhanced the relevance of the response. However, challenges relating
to the multiple response plans, competing roles among United Nations agencies, and the absence of a
clear inter-agency coordination mechanism resulted in gaps in critical areas of the response, such as SDB,
IPC, and Ebola case management. While a workable relationship was eventually established, concerns
were raised about the long-term efficiency and sustainability of this arrangement for larger and more
extensive PHEs. Internal UNICEF coordination (i.e. the support mechanisms across UCO, ESARO, and
59
HQ) was highly regarded. Particularly noteworthy were ESARO's proactive involvement and strategic
assistance before and during the L2 activation, which enables the repurposing of funds and resources for
the Ebola response, and its establishment of a Regional Ebola Preparedness and Response Plan.
Conclusion 3: UNICEF efforts had a significant and positive impact on affected populations. The
evaluation revealed many commendable efforts that were appropriate and effective in addressing key
issues, contributing to early case detection, and reducing transmission. UNICEF's RCCE activities led to
behavioural change within communities, by reaching 6,215,797 people through diverse mass media
channels with tailored and appropriate key messages, supported by a substantial allocation of funds (29%).
The strategic engagement of local responders and community influencers, along with the involvement of
VHTs and the implementation of IOA and anthropological studies, leveraged transdisciplinary data,
contributing to outbreak decision-making. The integration of WASH/IPC across pillars, ETUs, isolation
centres, community structures, and communities filled critical response gaps and showcased effective
strategies for future outbreaks, including the IPC Ring approach. The evaluation also highlighted UNICEF's
successful facilitation of access to essential nutritional supplies in ETUs, and the response exceeded its
target for reaching children and affected populations accessing MHPSS by 130%. The integration of
MHPSS and child protection in Ebola through innovative partnerships also received praise. Work around
child protection, together with GBV, exposed the dire needs for children and women, but the sustainability
of resources beyond the PHE response is questionable amid funding gaps. UNICEF's best practice in
education ensured every child attended school and completed final exams, by providing innovative
transportation approaches. Health continuity interventions ensured primary health was maintained to the
extent possible.
Conclusion 4: The L2 procedures were not sufficiently applied. The response effectiveness faced
several challenges, including important delays. The L2 response successfully mobilised a substantial
US$7,949,919, strategically allocating funds towards RCCE, case management, and WASH/IPC,
showcasing efficient resource utilisation and leveraging UNICEF's comparative advantage. With support
from ESARO, UNICEF demonstrated proactive measures by repurposing programme funds, redeploying
UCO staff, and initiating the response even before the L2 activation. However, the evaluation also identified
areas for potential improvement. The timing of the L2 activation – which occurred 36 days after the Ebola
outbreak was declared – raised questions about its impact on response efficiency and the need for timely
implementation. Hesitancy about declaring an L2, compounded by a lack of familiarity with the L2 protocols
and some procedures not being applied, contributed to delays. Challenges regarding securing funding,
gaps in human resources at the field level, a lack of contingency programme documents, procedural delays
in partnerships, and limited supplies adversely affected response efforts, leading to diminished relevance
in some cases. Many of the guidance documents developed during the Ebola outbreak were expected to
have been developed during non-outbreak times. Delays in MHPSS/child protection interventions, and their
absence from the National Response Plan, highlighted the importance of preparedness and the inclusion
of such interventions before outbreaks occur.
Conclusion 5: UNICEF’s approaches were child-centred and integrated women’s needs and other
vulnerabilities. UNICEF's advocacy efforts at the national level distinguished its response by successfully
integrating education, child protection, GBV/PSEA, and MHPSS into the national response, demonstrating
the organisation’s commitment to addressing multifaceted vulnerabilities in children during an outbreak that
affects entire communities. The active inclusion of children in decision-making processes demonstrated a
commitment to promoting children's voices, while partnerships with child-focused organisations
strengthened the child-friendly response. In terms of gender, UNICEF provided gender-disaggregated
targets and results, employed gender-sensitive approaches and messaging, and prioritised GBV/PSEA.
UNICEF also implemented interventions for persons with disabilities in certain aspects of the response,
60
such as the MDA. While MHPSS services benefitted 16,359 children, the response did not address the
long-term needs of all affected orphans and survivors, who will require sustained support to cope with the
psychological and social impacts of the outbreak. Additionally, there was a missed opportunity for UNICEF
to advocate early on for better treatment protocols and ensure the provision of specific paediatric medical
supplies, which resulted in some missing out. The response also revealed unintended negative
consequences, potentially increasing GBV cases during lockdowns and hindering access to GBV services.
The response further identified other vulnerable groups, but there are uncertainties as to what extent
assistance was provided to them, particularly for Ebola survivors. As a final observation, the evaluation
noted a gender imbalance at UCO, with an overrepresentation of male employees.
Conclusion 6: The Ebola response showed linkages to UNICEF’s development agenda but ongoing
support to affected communities was lacking. While the Ebola response was emergency-based, and
therefore short-term, there were clear linkages to UNICEF’s development programming in support of the
SDGs. During the Ebola response, UNICEF advanced its development agenda through policy
development, investing in sustainable WASH/IPC infrastructures, and contributed to enhanced
preparedness in affected districts, bolstering Uganda's resilience to future PHEs. UNICEF's support for the
Uganda National Post-Ebola Response Plan underscores its dedication to fostering continuity and
resilience beyond the immediate Ebola response. However, UNICEF’s exit from the response was
perceived as sudden by the affected populations, GoU, and local actors, and there were concerns around
sustainability as some UNICEF’s investments were not adequately maintained. Cash grants, to help
transition communities out of a crisis, were not implemented. Direct support to Ebola survivors and affected
children fell short. While the connection to the HDP nexus was not evident, and understanding of the nexus
principles remained nebulous, the Ebola response showed indications of strengthening linkages, including
joint country analysis, collaborative programming, building local capacities, and making risk-informed
decisions. Gaps persist in effectively integrating preparedness and preventive measures, addressing root
causes, formulating collective outcomes that go beyond the outbreak, and establishing multi-year
predictable funding.
7.2 Lessons learned
UNICEF’s Ebola response applied a series of strategies and interventions. Some of these proved
successful and should be seen as good practices for possible replication and adaptation by UNICEF and
other stakeholders in future PHEs. The lessons were derived from KII’s.
1. Lesson Learned 1: Engaging a diverse spectrum of community influencers is a critical factor
in attaining impactful social and behaviour change during Ebola outbreaks. The approach
employed by UNICEF, wherein VHTs, traditional leaders, healers, local politicians, musicians, and
even transport drivers were effectively mobilised, can serve as a successful model. Their
involvement was established through comprehensive training initiatives and active participation
within local task forces. The credibility these influencers held within their respective communities
facilitated their roles as trustworthy sources. Their invaluable insights were integrated into the
decision-making processes of the Ebola response, prominently showcased through their
representation within the DTFs and Village Task Forces.
2. Lesson learned 2: Developing an effective Ebola exit strategy necessitates establishing
explicit connections to enduring practices, while integrating consistent aid for
vulnerabilities uncovered throughout the response. Notably, the response identified a need for
continued child protection, MHPSS, and GBV services, but also sustained support to Ebola
survivors. This underscores the need for continuous service provision beyond the immediate
61
emergency phase. As communities recover from crises, a crucial facet emerges: the need for
comprehensive reorientation and reintegration efforts, to enable them to pursue a life of dignity and
purpose.
3. Lesson learned 3: A proactive approach to reducing ambiguities in mandates between WHO
and UNICEF can improve the coherence of the response. These circumstances resulted in both
duplication in certain areas and noticeable gaps in others. Throughout the outbreak, UNICEF
undertook proactive efforts to ascertain distinctive roles and duties. However, the evaluation
underscores the potential benefits of pre-emptively identifying specific interventions and delineating
UNICEF's precise contributions within the context of PHEs.
4. Lesson learned 4: Applying the UNICEF emergency procedures ensures rapid and agile
emergency responses. It became evident that there was a lack of familiarity with L2 emergency
procedures and this resulted in bottlenecks and subsequent delays in achieving results. These
setbacks were notably experienced across multiple fronts, including deployment, supply, and
partnerships. This lesson serves as a reminder of the need to adapt development procedures to
align them with the agile and adaptive requirements of emergency situations.
5. Lesson learned 5: Extra efforts to tackle external barriers are required to ensure continuity
of essential services. Lockdowns and movement restrictions impede access to health and
education. Throughout the response, UNICEF commendably facilitated the uninterrupted provision
of essential services. However, it became evident that several barriers hindered effective access.
Notably, factors such as scarcity of transportation options, increased costs and/or loss of household
income, and fear of Ebola transmission, contributed to reduced accessibility. This lesson
underscores the need to address these barriers proactively in future emergency scenarios.
7.3 Recommendations
A series of recommendations have been formulated to guide responses to future PHEs in Uganda and
beyond. These recommendations are based on findings from the evaluation, complemented by insights
from the evaluators. The recommendations were validated, and extra nuance was added to them, in
collaboration with the ERG, including UCO and ESARO, through a co-creation workshop. However, the
workshop did not include external stakeholders. To ensure alignment to UNICEF’s ambitions in regard to
PHEs, the evaluation team has framed the recommendations around UNICEF’s White Paper (see above,
on page 13, but the recommendations also build on the UNICEF CCCs and the emergency procedures.
Each recommendation is accompanied by suggested actions, which are designed to facilitate
implementation. The reader is encouraged to read this section in tandem with the above sections on
innovative approaches, missed opportunities, and lessons learned.
Recommendations and suggested actions Priority Responsible
Recommendation 1: Strengthen preparedness for PHEs
Rationale: Ebola and other emerging diseases are becoming more frequent and increasingly severe.

 Establish funding mechanisms to fill gaps in PHE responses,
ensuring flexibility in addressing unforeseen costs
Recommendation 3: Strengthen inter-agency coherence in PHEs, in line with the IASC SOPs
Protocol for the Control of Infectious Disease events25
Rationale: The Ebola response was coordinated by MoH and WHO, rather than by the United Nations
coordination team. There were several instances where the roles and responsibilities of implementing
agencies, both in ETUs and within communities, were not clear. This lack of clarity resulted in
duplication of efforts, gaps, and tensions among United Nations agencies

Recommendation 4: Continue placing children, women, and vulnerabilities at the centre of the
PHE response
Rationale: Children, women, and vulnerable populations are disproportionately affected in crises.
Although the response showed promising indications of targeting these groups, there is a need to
integrate this intention from the early onset of PHEs, and to prioritise practical issues over
policy/strategy development
Suggested actions in line with the UNICEF White Paper’s recommendations 5, 6, and 7
 Ensure GBV/PSEA risk mitigation and response at early onset in

Recommendation 5: Prepare for better data to drive evidence-based responses
Rationale: UNICEF implemented several good data collection, analysis, and feedback
tools/interventions. The UNICEF Ebola response collected disaggregated data, with some children’s
data coming in later in the response, but this was not systematic. While there are indications that the
collective data informed decision-making, there is a need to have innovative, ready-to-use data
management tools that promote the rights and wellbeing of all children and those with vulnerabilities at
the onset of PHEs
Suggested actions in line with UNICEF’s White Paper recommendation 8

Reporting to
Section
Introduction
In accordance with the coverage norms of UNICEF’s Evaluation Policy 2018, short-term level two (L2)
emergencies must be evaluated at least once and protracted L2 emergencies should be evaluated once
every three years. Such L2 evaluations are conducted by the Evaluation Section of the respective UNICEF
Regional Office.
Building on evidence from recently conducted evaluationsclix, the ESARO Evaluation Section is proposing
an activity best characterized as a learning-focused evaluation (LFE) of UNICEF Uganda’s response to the
L2 Ebola emergency in Uganda. As UNICEF transitions its response post-L2, the evaluation can provide a
66
structure for reflection, learning and recommendations for post L2 response planning and how to improve
preparedness for future health emergencies, while also reflecting on key opportunities of linking
humanitarian-development and peace action for a strengthened and resilient public sector support to public
health outbreaks. In this context, the evaluation will need to be utilization focused and forward-looking.
In line with UNICEF’s Evaluation Policy, which stipulates that the regional offices are responsible for the
management of evaluations of L2 emergencies, the LFE will be managed by the Evaluation Section of
UNICEF’s Eastern and Southern Africa Regional Office (ESARO), under the overall oversight of the ESARO
Regional Director, and in close collaboration with the UNICEF Uganda Country Office (UCO). Quality
assurance will be provided by UNICEF’s Evaluation Office, which reports directly to UNICEF’s Executive
Director, and is functionally independent within the Organization. The LFE will be conducted in accordance
with the provisions of UNICEF’s 2018 Evaluation Policy, UNICEF’s 2022 Disability inclusive evaluations in
UNICEF guidance, and the norms and standards of the United Nations Development Group (UNEG).
The terms of reference present a brief description of the crisis and UNICEF’s response; the scope,
objectives, and key questions of the evaluation; evaluation methodology; stakeholder involvement; roles
and responsibilities; evaluation process; deliverables; and evaluators' qualifications.
Background
Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs
On 20 September 2022, Uganda declared an outbreak caused by the Sudan Ebola Virus (SVD) following
a confirmed case in Mubende district. By 8 December 2022, 142 cases with 55 deaths had been reported
in nine affected districts: Mubende, Kassanda, Kyegegwa, Bunyangabu, Kagadi, Kampala, Wakiso,
Masaka and Jinja.
The epicentre of this outbreak continues to be in the districts of Mubende and Kassanda located
approximately 3 hours away from the capital in an area of high population movement which resulted in
further spread of the outbreak to Kampala and other six districts. Ebola is a serious, often fatal disease in
humans and the lack of approved vaccine and therapeutics for the SVD represents an additional challenge
in curbing this outbreak. There is strong leadership for the response by the MoH with support from partners,
including UNICEF. A National Response Plan, comprising a total of seven pillars and covering a period of
three months (October- December 2022) with focus on high-risk districts was developed by MoH and is
currently under revision.
Cross pillar teams from MoH were deployed in all districts to lead response activities. There are currently
nine operational Ebola Treatment Units (ETU) and/or isolation facilities across the country. In addition to
testing at the national level at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI), there is on-site testing via a
mobile laboratory deployed to Mubende. A multi-stakeholder National Task Force (NTF) is co-chaired by
MoH and WHO coordinates the EVD response. The NTF oversees the Incident Management Team (IMT)
consisting of pillar and co-pillar leads responsible for the day-to-day management of the EVD response.
The IMT structure is mirrored at the district level. UNICEF provides support to and participates in
coordination efforts at both national and district level, including in Task Forces, IMTs and in pillar meetings.
UNICEF Response and Funding Overview
UNICEF response in Uganda started immediately following the declaration of the outbreak on 20
September 2022 and is organized around six key pillars: a/. coordination and leadership; b/. IPC/WASH;
c/. Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE); d/. case management, including child
friendly care and nutrition for children admitted in Ebola Treatment Units and Mental Health and
Psychosocial Support (MHPSS), and e/. continuity of essential health and social services including
67
education, with a focus on keeping schools safe and open whilst offering remote learning where necessary
and specific services for women and girls including those related to SRHR. Considering the involved risks,
UNICEF activated a Level 2 (L2) Corporate Emergency Activation Procedure (CEAP)clx Scale-up for the
Ebola outbreak in Uganda on 27 October 2022 to 26 April 2023.
Purpose and Objectives of the Evaluation
The overarching purpose of the LFE is to promote learning and long-term planning for what comes after
the UNICEF Uganda L2 Ebola response, including identifying preparedness interventions for potential
future public health emergencies. The secondary purpose of this evaluation is to strengthen UNICEF’s
accountability to children and affected populations, partners, and donors supporting the response at large.
The objectives of the LFE are to:
● Provide a preliminary assessment of UNICEF’s response to the Ebola outbreak in Uganda vis-a-
vis issues of appropriateness/relevance, effectivenessclxi, efficiency (including value for money),
connectednessclxii and coordination/partnerships, with a specific focus on UNICEF’s level of
preparedness and the adaptiveness/responsiveness of UNICEF response and how it has
addressed issues for children, adolescents, and women, including those with disability,
marginalization and deprivation.
● Draw out key learning and recommendations to equip UNICEF Uganda decision-makers with the
information they need to make adjustments and formulate UCO’s transition from L2 emergency to
long-term strategy, ensuring humanitarian-development-peace nexus bridging and preparedness
for future public health emergencies.
In line with the dual learning and accountability objectives, the evaluation is expected to generate actionable
recommendations on how to strengthen the next phase of the ongoing response to the L2 emergency, how
to best plan for the post-L2 phase, and how to prepare for future health emergencies, while also reflecting
on key opportunities of linking humanitarian with development action for a strengthened and resilient public
sector support to public health outbreaks. The evaluation will provide structure for reflection and learning
and will adhere to principles of participation and utilization. The primary audience for this evaluation is
UNICEF staff, management, and regional advisors who are responsible for leading the UNICEF Uganda
Ebola response. The evaluation’s findings will also be shared with key national and district-based
counterparts, in addition to the main stakeholders involved in this evaluation at the community level.
The approach will draw on elements of a lessons learned exercise and real-time evaluation, providing real
time feedback, and generating learning that can be used in the remainder of the current response and
towards UNICEF’s longer-term goals and preparedness planning. The LFE will be:
● Non-intrusive to response operations with a compressed timeline and a small evaluation team.
● Flexible and iterative, creating space for new questions, methods, analysis, and feedback.
● Driven by questions and issues confronting UCO’s response strategy that identify priority areas,
gaps, and areas of focus for the post-L2 phase.
● Designed to capture system dynamics and surface innovative strategies and ideas (‘what works’)
and to describe which solution and response UCO has put in place to respond to the emerging and
evolving needs (for instance, using real-time assessment methods - “how it works”).
● Timed to strategically feed into the reflections on and development of the post-L2 strategy and
preparedness planning.
Scope of the Evaluation
Institutional scope: While noting the multi-agency dimensions in the Ebola response, in particular the role
played by other agencies, this LFE is limited to evaluating the work of UNICEF and its down-stream partners
in responding to the crisis. However, such an evaluation needs take into account the wider framework of
the response, including that of the Government counterparts (both at national and district levels), the UN
68
system as a whole, the donor community, the international non-governmental organizations and national
civil society organizations and agencies involved in the response, in analyzing the respective role UNICEF
plays in this response mix and the related expectations of stakeholders in regard to UNICEF’s response.
Within UNICEF, the evaluation will focus on the Ebola response implemented by UCO (and as per the UCO
response plan), and will assess interactions, coordination, roles and responsibilities, support from and
expectations of the UNICEF East and Southern Africa Regional Office (ESARO) and UNICEF’s
headquarters in New York and UNICEF’s Supply Division in Copenhagen (in relation to emergency supplies
and procurement services provided).
Programmatic scope: The UNICEF Uganda Ebola Preparedness and Response Plan reinforces
UNICEF’s ‘integrated approach’ to emergency response, bringing together Health, including HIV, Child
Protection, Social Protection, Education, WASH, Nutrition, Social and Behavior Change (SBC), and
Supply/Logistics, and implemented through the pillars of the national response to provide lifesaving
interventions in the treatment and prevention of the Ebola outbreak and provision of basic services, such
as health, WASH, nutrition, education, MHPSS and protection. The LFE will focus on the coverage,
connectedness, timeliness, effectiveness, efficiency and relevance of the programmatic response, including
UNICEF’s preparedness for the response, effectiveness of mobilizing partnerships with CSO and donors,
the level of internal and external coordination/partnerships contributing to success or failure factors, the
adaptiveness/responsiveness of the response, the child-centred aspect of the response, and how it has
addressed gender, disability and age vulnerabilities, including marginalization, deprivation, violence and
abuse. Using appropriateness, effectiveness, and connectedness/coherence criteria, the LFE will also
consider the humanitarian-development-peace nexus with a view to mid- to long-term planning.
Operational scope: The LFE will assess the timeliness, effectiveness and efficiency of the UNICEF
response in terms of ensuring timely delivery of supplies based on needs; the timeliness and effectiveness
of UNICEF scale up efforts and staffing deployments (including duty of care); the quality and inclusiveness
of internal collaboration and cohesion on operational aspects of the response planning and implementation;
the relevance of financial modalities, governance and assurance procedures and measures introduced;
application of the L2 emergency simplified procedures and will reflect on operational opportunities, best
practices, and challenges for rapid scale up in Uganda country context environment.
Geographic focus: The evaluation team will consider the districts in Uganda most affected by the crisis,
and at the inception phase will establish a methodology for sampling and visiting affected localities where
UNICEF provides its emergency response.
Time frame: The evaluation will consider the entire span of the UNICEF Uganda Ebola emergency
response, starting from the declaration of the outbreak by the Government on 20 September 2022, going
through the activation of UNICEF’s Level 2 CEAP for the Uganda Ebola crisis on 27 October 2022 and
covering the ongoing response. The LFE will also be forward-looking to inform the formulation of UCO’s
transition from L2 emergency to long-term strategy. The evaluation itself will take place from February 2023
until May 2023, timed to capture emerging results, and strategically feed into framing the post-L2 phase.
Key Learning Questions
Unlike a traditional evaluation, the focus of the LFE on utilization and learning will require a preliminary
round of stakeholder engagement to help validate and vet the focus and questions as part of developing a
learning agenda. Briefly stated, a learning agenda is a tool for articulating key challenges and opportunities,
framed around key questions, that UCO is encountering and wants to learn from. The result is a living
document that guides the evaluation questions, data collection, learning discussions, and feedback loops.
69
Creating the learning agenda will require a means to quickly vet questions for inclusion. Minimally, such
process should consider criteria such as whether the question is indeed ’answerable’ and if answered,
whether it is actionable.
The initial set of priority Learning Agenda questions, which have been identified based on discussions
during the TOR development, include:
Learning Question 1: How well prepared was UNICEF and how well has UNICEF responded to the
Ebola emergency in Uganda?
1.1. To what extent does UNICEF’s response meet the following criteria: a. Effectiveness (achieving
stated objectives, preparedness and timeliness, adaptiveness and responsiveness, accountability
to affected populations, in particular women and children including those with disabilities); b.
Efficiency of UNICEF response? - How efficient was UNICEF response to date? Scaling up,
deployments, use of financial resources, resource mobilization efforts, mobilizing partnerships?
Duty of care? Value for Money? c. Coverage and proportionality (in scaling-up for adequate
coverage, reaching all demographic populations of vulnerability and marginalisation (i.e. women,
girls, boys, and youth, people with disabilities etc.) (and why); d. Quality and coherence (consistent
with relevant standards and policies, i.e., CCCs, Sphere Standards and Public Health Guidance
for Ebola response); e. Equity and coverage (i.e., delivered for different groups including women,
girls, boys, adolescent and youth, persons with disabilities, refugee children etc. marginalization
and deprivation); and f. Connectedness (sustainability from a humanitarian perspective); and f.
Coordination (both internal (within UCO, with RO and with HQ) and external) and partnerships?
Learning Question 2: What have been UNICEF’s successful and/or innovative approaches and
barriers in the Uganda Ebola emergency response?
2.1. What are the successful and/or innovative approachesclxiii of the ongoing response that could be
leveraged in the continued response? Were all opportunities used?
2.1. What challenges and lessons for UCO’s health and emergency preparedness planning have
emerged as a result of the Ebola emergency? What should we avoid doing again? Were lessons
learned from previous outbreaks applied in this response? As a result of the UNICEF Ebola
response, what areas have emerged as gaps – in programmatic and operational capacity,
coverage etc?
Learning Question 3: What actions are required in order to strengthen the response and to prepare
for the transition to longer-term programming?
3.1. Considering immediate risks and challenges: What mechanisms and systems should UCO adapt
and put in place to ensure agility and prepare for the immediate future, adjusting to the changing
context and different age, gender and disability related needs of women and children and the
population in affected areas?
● What are the existing opportunities?
● Where are there constraints currently?
● What further adaptations would/should be made?
3.2. How can UCO integrate the emergency response into longer-term programming?
● What can be the quick wins of integrating the public health emergency response into
longer-term programming, specifically in the design and operationalization of the
‘humanitarian/development nexuses for outbreaks?
● How should the response be integrated into the Uganda AWP in applying a risk informed
programming, preparedness, and resilience lens?
70
The learning questions identified above are the jumping off point for the evaluators to further elaborate
during the Inception Phase of this evaluation, and then transition to the Implementation Phase.
Evaluation Approach and Methods
The approaches and methods of this LFE are largely similar to those utilized in other evaluations with
important adaptations. For example, this evaluation shall combine elements of a retrospective and formative
evaluation with those of a lesson learned exercise and real-time evaluation, with the intention of delivering
findings and conclusions in a short timeframe. The basis of this approach is informed by some of the
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development-Development Assistance Committee criteria
(i.e., relevance, connectedness, coverage, and effectiveness), and also borrows from other types of
exercises and data collection tools. This type of evaluation looks at the past to understand the course of
events and the history of a response. At the same time, it involves direct observation and consideration of
future scenarios and planning. Even with this blended approach, the LFE is expected to adhere to UNEG
Norms and Standards and Ethical Guidelines for evaluations and meet UNICEF’s evaluation quality
standards per the Global Evaluation Reports Oversight System (GEROS).
Since the evaluation design does not follow a classic evaluation methodology, but draws from several
models and evaluation concepts, the phases of more traditional evaluations have been compressed into
three main phases: 1) scoping, inception and preliminary data collection; 2) data collection, analysis and
sharing of (preliminary) findings and verification, 3) report writing, recommendation development and
dissemination. All three phases will have commenced within three months of contracting the evaluation
firm.
For the Inception Phase, recognizing the constraints of time and being sensitive to the burden an evaluation
can place on emergency response staff, it will start with desk review of existing information (including from
other evaluations of UNICEF responses to Ebola crises) and analysis and be as non-intrusive as possible.
In this phase, the evaluators will review existing secondary data and documentation such as SitReps;
Humanitarian Appeals; UNICEF Ebola response plans, field reports, EMT updates, outbreak investigation
and initial response reports; partnerships with implementing partners, monitoring indicators and reports;
analysis of funding information and fundraising efforts, HR, and supply data; assessment of UCO
preparedness and contingency plans reflected in the EPP, etc. Other data sources include information
made available through Integrated Outbreak Analytics and its use; DHIS, geo-spatial data, Rapid Pro,
Google analytics and social media and social listening analytics. This phase will also require a preliminary
round of stakeholder engagement to help validate and vet the focus and questions as part of developing
the learning agenda.
An evaluation matrix will be developed to demonstrate how the evaluators plan to answer each learning
question, including the data sources, methods, and products that will be developed for each. A Theory of
Change (ToC) approach (including reconstructing a theory of change for the response) will be used in
consultation with stakeholders, as appropriate. Discussions of the ToC will focus on mapping the
assumptions behind the response’s desired change(s) and the causal linkages between the intervention(s)
and the intended outcomes. As part of this analysis, the implementation of the response over the evaluation
period will also be examined, covering UNICEF’s capacity to adapt to the changing context in Uganda, and
responsiveness to changing needs and priorities of the outbreak will also be looked at. At the end of the
inception phase, the team will present initial findings and assumptions that will guide the implementation
phase.
During the Implementation Phase, data collection will be done rapidly based on direct observation, focus
group discussions, community rapid assessments (if feasible), and key informant interviews, including in
71
affected communities and with children and youth where possible, as per the learning agenda developed
in the Inception Phase. The LFE will use a mixed methods approach to answer the learning agenda
questions as outlined above. Triangulation of data sources and types, many internal, will be needed. Like
the questions, the methods may change or be employed differently in order to be agile and responsive.
Analytical methods are likely to include qualitative data analysis and quantitative data analysis of secondary
or monitoring data. As needed, other methods could include data digest sessions, process mapping,
forcefield analysis, participatory ranking and/or other approaches. Due to the ongoing Ebola outbreak, as
well as the COVID-19 pandemic, the LFE should take all health and safety precautions and measures as
appropriate and in adherence with national guidelines.
It is expected that the LFE apply a strong human and child rights, equity, disability inclusion, age and gender
focus by: i) including human rights, equity and gender in learning agenda questions; ii) making evaluation
methodology and data collection and analysis methods equity and gender-responsive; and iii) reflecting
human and child rights, equity, disability, age and gender analysis in evaluation findings, conclusions and
concrete recommendations and action points that can be addressed in the design of the longer-term
strategy both for a better integration of human rights, equity and gender in the response, and for
strengthened results for children.
With the goal to capture lessons and make conclusions that will be used to strengthen an ongoing response
and an upcoming transition, the evaluation will be designed with a strong utilization focus. After collecting
data, the expectation is that the evaluation team would share deliverables quickly with users and would
engage with staff during two debrief sessions and two workshops to discuss, reflect, and incorporate
findings into the ongoing decision-making process.
Evaluation Limitations
Key limitations of the LFE include the access and availability of data in the Uganda Ebola context and the
need to balance timeliness with depth of information and well-substantiated findings. The evaluation is
limited to the response in Uganda where the Level 2 CEAP has been declared. The fluid situation and
COVID-19 pandemic may affect the evaluation team’s ability to visit affected districts and the availability of
key stakeholders to meet with the evaluators might be reduced. During the inception phase a contingency
plan will be developed.
Evaluation Products and Use
To ensure the work is as useful as possible, the evaluators will employ iterative loops to feed information
into decision-making process. Learning products will be focused on the needs of key decision-makers and
will be designed to be useful and usable. The exact nature, format, and scope of each product will be
finalised with relevant decision-makers and users during the Inception Phase. Some potential learning
products to facilitate use will include:
● Options memos documenting potential pathways forward and their implications.
● Decision logs recording which decisions were made (or not made) and the rationale for why the
selected action was taken (or not taken).
● Presentations during Country Management Team or Emergency Management Team meeting to
facilitate development of evidence-based recommendations.
● Human interest stories that describe the response in a more personable way.
● Infographics or other data-driven references.
● Policy briefs and/or summary brief of the evaluation.
● Document Archive on SharePoint.
72
Workplan
The workplan below presents an illustrative timeline for evaluation activities that would span a period of
approximately four months (February 2023 through May 2023). The LFE would launch on 1st February
2023 with a combined inception and initial data collection phase. During the inception mission, the
evaluation team will prepare and circulate an inception report, and at the end of the mission, the evaluators
will present the inception report which would include first impressions and preliminary observations for initial
validation that would help inform and better refine the data collection phase. Following ethical review of the
inception report, the evaluation team would undertake an intense two-week data collection mission,
culminating in a debrief workshop with UCO to discuss emerging findings. Two weeks later, in online events,
the evaluation team will present draft findings, conclusions and lessons learned in relation to the key
questions outlined in the learning agenda. The findings and conclusions will be refined, taking into account
the feedback received during the online events. A workshop will be held in Kampala in early April 2023 with
staff from the regional, country and Uganda field offices to discuss and further develop the lessons and
recommendations and encourage the uptake and use of the findings. In early May 2023, the first fully
developed draft of the evaluation report should be ready, with a view to finalizing it by end of May 2023.
The format of and page limits for the final deliverables will be decided in the inception period. A high value
will be placed on products that are concise and communicate well with different audiences. Thus, the final
products should be edited and produced to include infographics and print layout in an easy-to-read format.
The report structure, format and quality should adhere to the UNICEF Evaluation Report standards and the
GEROS Quality Assessment System.
The workplan in this TOR is high-level and is intended to be further fleshed out during the inception phase.
Key deliverables are highlighted in bold and indicated by number. The below timeline does not include
presentations to the CMT and EMT but are expected to occur throughout the four-month timeline depending
on when these meetings are scheduled.

Management Arrangements and Quality Assurance
The evaluators will be recruited by and report to the ESARO Evaluation Section under the overall oversight
of the ESARO Regional Director. For the day-to-day management of the LFE, the Evaluation Section will
appoint an Evaluation Manager who will be accountable to the Regional Evaluation Adviser. Quality
assurance will be provided by UNICEF’s Evaluation Office.
UCO will appoint an Evaluation Focal Point who will act as the primary liaison with the Evaluation Manager
and will facilitate the evaluation process at the country level.
An LFE Reference Group will be established to ensure ownership from relevant stakeholder groups of the
LFE process, provide expert advice, inputs, and support to the LFE as the evaluation unfolds. The reference
group will have the following responsibilities:
● Provide inputs in the inception phase to influence the approach of the evaluation, and, where
necessary, provide information and institutional knowledge as key informants;
● Support the work of the evaluation team by facilitating connections with key informants and
ensuring the team has relevant reference documents;
● Review selected evaluation products (implementation plan, learning products, draft, and final
report) and provide written comments to the evaluation team through the evaluation manager; and,
● Contribute to the post-evaluation management response, action plan and dissemination strategy.
ESARO will assure the quality of the evaluation and guarantee its alignment with UNEG Norms and
Standards and Ethical Guidelines and provide quality assurance checking that the findings and conclusions
are relevant and proposed adaptations are actionable. All major deliverables will be reviewed first by
ESARO (zero draft) and then by the LFE Reference Group. The inception report and draft final report will
be subject to a satisfactory rating by an external quality assurance facility, using quality assurance
checklists provided in Annexes 1 and 2, before payment can be made. The evaluators will be responsible
74
for ensuring that recommendations for quality improvement of the report(s) are fully addressed. The Final
Evaluation report will be also submitted to GEROS for final quality assessment with feedback provided to
ESARO/MCO on the quality of the evaluation.

Assessment of proposals process and methods
Interested and qualified evaluation firms are requested to submit one technical proposal and one financial
proposal within the indicated deadline. After the opening, each proposal will be assessed first on its
technical merits and subsequently on its price.
All bidders’ proposals will be reviewed by the evaluation panel. The proposal with the best overall value,
composed of technical merit and price, will be recommended for approval. The overall weighting between
technical and financial evaluation will be as follows: The technical component will account for 70 per cent
of the total points allocated and the financial component will account for 30 per cent of the total points
allocated. The assessed technical score must be equal to or exceed 50 of the total 70 points allocated to
the technical evaluation in order to be considered technically compliant and for consideration in the financial
evaluation.

ANNEX 8: CHILDREN’S FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS
Reflection on the inclusion of children in FGDs in the evaluation
To elicit the perspectives of children, the evaluation team chose FGDs over individual interviews to avoid
potential power imbalances between researchers and participants that might exist between an adult and a
child in a one-on-one interview.
Focus groups consisting of group members familiar with each other created a safe peer environment and
helped children to express their opinion. Permission from parents or legal guardians was obtained prior to
conducting the FGDs. Participating children were selected using a combination of purposive (because they
fulfilled the inclusion criteria of appropriate age range and gender diversity) and convenience (they were
conveniently accessible and had experience with the Ebola preparedness and response) sampling. Playful
group activities, concrete questions using simple language and easily recognizable symbols facilitated the
participation of younger children. The FGDs were implemented in classrooms with teacher involvement to
diminish shyness among the children. A combination of thematic and ethnographic analysis was used to
focus on the particularities of children’s experiences and practices during the Ebola epidemic. Data
gathered during these FGDs opened a window into children’s lived experiences during the Ebola epidemic
and provided insight into how UNICEF’s Ebola response activities enabled Ugandan children to survive,
thrive and fulfil their potential.
While these methods did collect some rich insights from children that benefitted from UNICEF’s
interventions, the evaluators felt that the children's responses were heavily influenced by various factors,
including a social desirability bias – the desire to please what adults want to hear – but also gratitude and
reciprocity. Children who have benefited from UNICEF's programs might feel grateful for the assistance
they have received. This gratitude – desire to please UNICEF but also to avoid a reduction in UNICEF’s
support - led to responses that mostly aligned with a positive perception of the organization's efforts and
did not always result in candid and authentic responses. The evaluators had to remind the children
continuously that they can express positive and less positive experiences comfortably. Other biases
included peer pressure. This was particularly present among younger children wanting to conform and
agree with popular opinions rather than expressing their genuine thoughts.
Still, the FGDs with children collected rich insights how children perceived UNICEF’s Ebola response. As
an organisation, UNICEF was known by the children and mostly through its education support. Involving
children, a primary rights holder group, promoted child-centred approaches, and the right to participate and
accountability.

ANNEX 9: COMMUNITY RAPID ASSESSMENT (CRA)
QUESTIONNAIRE
Reflection on use of CRA as data collection tool for evaluations
The experience of using mobile phone technology to conduct a CRA as one of this evaluation’s data
collection tools was mixed. In terms of VfM and quality/ quantity of data collected, when compared to
traditional qualitative data collection methods, the evaluation team found the cost of the CRA to be quite
high especially when considering the amount (minimal for the cost) and quality (macro, not granular) of
data collected.
The purpose of the CRA was to collect rich, population-based data that would help examine behaviors and
drivers in order to assess relevance and effectiveness and to better prepare UNICEF to address future
Ebola outbreaks. The CRA did provide rich insight into the wider Ebola preparedness and prevention
campaign to which UNICEF was a key contributor. The options of conducting a digital survey via Random
Digital Dialling (RDD) or via a 1-6-1 Database survey, where a robochat is conducted via Interactive Voice
Response (IVR) with randomly selected individuals located in specific set of districts (RDD), or with those
who have previously opted in to participate in future digital surveys (1-6-1 Database Survey), similarly
located in specific districts, did not enable the evaluation team to target individuals at the sub-district level
or with UNICEF-specific knowledge. Rather, the CRA allowed for an evaluation of aspects of UNICEF’s
interventions only via transitive inference. An example includes for example: If the GoU-led interventions
brought about the desired change in Ugandan’s knowledge, attitudes, and practices vis-à-vis Ebola, and
as UNICEF was a key contributor to the GoU’s response, then the successes (and failures) of the GoU’s
interventions can be (partially) attributed to UNICEF.
An additional challenge included the low occurrence of Ebola in the population, meaning, it can be
challenging to gather a large enough sample to draw meaningful conclusion which as well comes with
increased costs. The survey therefor focussed primarily on assessing the effectiveness of the activities
conducted at the population-level of affected districts, such as RCCE implementation. A sampling bias was
mobile phone ownership and this might be influenced by socioeconomic factors. Those who can afford
mobile phones and data plans might have different characteristics from those who cannot, and this
potentially led to sampling bias and potential misrepresentation of the population.
Still the CRA provided some statistically significant and rich insights on knowledge, attitudes, and
perceptions of Ebola in the population. The evaluation team felt like results were overall generalisable as
this data reflected mostly the findings from other data collection methods like FGDs and KIIs.

ANNEX 21: OVERVIEW OF MISSED
OPPORTUNITIES OF UNICEF EBOLA RESPONSE
More proactive all-of-UN advocacy on coordination, and translating policy into
practice, to a government that in general is open to change, would likely have
resulted in better progress. It was suggested that phasing out this practice
Advocacy amounts to a missed opportunity for UNICEF to engage in targeted advocacy
efforts. It was also suggested that such internal focused advocacy at the
ministry level is more productive than continuing to engage in trainings, which
amounts to a lost investment.
UNICEF was not a member of the GoU National Ebola Plan revision before the
Preparedness 2022 outbreak. When the outbreak began the UCO was therefore on the back
and an earlier foot vis-à-vis donors and UNICEF’s role in PHEs. If the UCO had proactively put
agreement on together a concept note or had previously compiled a paper that
roles and comprehensively detailed the UCO’s responsibilities vis-à-vis PHEs, this could
responsibilities have increased donor flexibility and ended/reduced earmarking. Such a concept
of UNICEF in note could serve a dual purpose: educating donors as to UNICEF’s specific
PHEs needs vis-à-vis PHEs and informing the regional office and HQ on how they
could best support the UCO in terms of resource mobilisation.
The implementation of cash grants was not carried out, which, in retrospect,
Cash grants
was a missed opportunity to support post-Ebola needs and vulnerabilities.

ANNEX 22: UNICEF UGANDA LESSONS FROM
PREVIOUS EBOLA OUTBREAKS
A health epidemic requires a multi-sectoral child rights approach.
A community-based response is optimal.
The child protection response should be targeted and measurable.
Mental health and psychosocial programming are an essential part of a response to a PHE
but require clear definitions and expertise.
Family and community-based emergency support should be linked to longer-term child
protection systems.
Systems in child protection programming for delivery of cash grants and supplies need re-
enforcement.
Centre-based care is a service of last resort.
Accurate and timely data is essential.
Coordination at the regional, national, and de-centralised levels is required for improved
efficiency.
Timely and immediate funding is key to an epidemic response.
Recruitment and deployment of well-trained, professional staff is critical.
Response to the epidemic should build on existing government infrastructure and capacity.
GBV identification and referral should be integrated into the Ebola response.
Ensure that women and girls are considered in all aspects of the planning and response,
including in recruitment of staff.
WASH is a fundamental pillar of an Ebola response, especially with regards to IPC, body
management, community engagement, and promotion of health-seeking behaviours.
Epidemic surveillance, operational research (IOA) and case detection efforts should be
based on local contexts and community involvement.
Health communication should prioritise messaging and methods that are inclusive,
culturally appropriate, and trusted.
Community engagement should not be one-size-fits-all; communities are not
homogeneous, and responders should understand contextual power relations between
groups to ensure a community-led response that is inclusive and relevant to all.
Resources should not be focused solely on fighting Ebola, but ongoing healthcare provision
should also be supported during an epidemic response.
Ebola survivors should not be forgotten. Health complications due to the virus last long
after the person has been cured of the infection, and survivors experience stigma,
psychological trauma, and economic difficulties.
Ebola is traumatic. People experience fear, stigmatisation, grief, and trauma. Psychosocial
support should be part of the Ebola response.
