Definitions
To avoid unnecessary confusion, the Bringing Back Learning Evaluation (BBL Evaluation) has applied the
following definitions for common concepts used. The BBL Evaluation recognizes that there are many other
definitions that might be valid for other circumstances.
Concept Working definition
Accessibility The extent to which project activities can be reached / obtained by targeted
beneficiaries; e.g., knowledge about the possibilities to participate, location of
distributions, etc.
Activity Actions taken or work performed through which inputs, such as funds, technical
assistance and other types of resources are mobilized to produce specific
outputs.
Advocacy Any attempt to persuade another side to agree to one’s point of view
Capacity The process by which individuals, groups, organizations, institutions and
Development / countries develop, enhance and organize their systems, resources and
Building / knowledge, all reflected in their abilities, individually and collectively, to perform
Strengthening functions, solve problems and achieve objectives.
Coherence The extent to which activities of different actors are complementary or
contradictory.
Communication The process of transmitting information in a way that will be understood and thus
communication goes beyond simple information dissemination. To ensure that
the information will be understood any communication should be based on a
good knowledge of the context of the target group, in terms of values, priorities,
resources, capacities, etc. Communication becomes even more important and
takes on added dimensions when it involves inter-cultural or inter-organizational
communication.
Consultation An inclusive process that finds out what targeted stakeholders think about
specific activities, projects, or approaches. Focus groups, questionnaires, and
interviews are common consultation techniques.
Coordination The process of systematically analyzing a situation, developing relevant
information, and informing appropriate command authority of viable alternatives
for selection of the most effective combination of available resources to meet
specific objectives.
Equity All children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential
without discrimination, bias or favouritism.
Equity based An approach that seeks to understand and address the root causes of inequity
approach so that all children, particularly those who suffer the worst deprivations in society,
have access to education, health care, sanitation, clean water, protection, and
other services necessary for their survival, growth and development.
Gender equality Women and men, and girls and boys, enjoy the same rights, resources,
opportunities, and protections. It does not require that girls and boys, or women
and men, be the same, or that they be treated exactly alike.
National This refers to the whole country. In the survey, the national level refers to
legislation mandated by the central government.
Ownership The targeted stakeholders such as communities, local and national authorities
exercise effective leadership over the project activities. Ownership is closely

Concept Working definition
linked to effective participation, which should allow only to implement activities
that have been identified as priorities by the targeted stakeholders.
Participation Participation is about including targeted stakeholders in decision-making
processes, including identifying needs and solutions and be actively involved in
project and program design, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation.
Common participatory techniques include facilitated community meetings and
workshops.
Social Protection Policies and programmes designed to protect people from shocks and stresses
throughout their lives. It can include safety nets, social insurance schemes, cash
transfers, labour market regulations or facilitated access to essential services.
Stakeholders Agencies, organizations, groups, or individuals who have a direct or indirect role
and interest in the objectives and implementation of the project and its evaluation.
Sub‐national This refers to administrative levels that fall below the national level. In the context
of Myanmar these are states/regions, districts, townships.

Executive Summary
This report details Evaluation of the Bringing Back Learning Programme (BBL) for Myanmar, termed
the BBL Evaluation. The BBL Programme is a programme designed to respond to the twin crisis which
have emerged in Myanmar. The first being the Covid-19 pandemic which reached Myanmar on 23 March
2020. The second being the February 2021 military takeover d'état in Myanmar when the democratically
elected members of the country's ruling party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), were deposed
by the Tatmadaw, Myanmar's military, which then vested power in a military junta. The confluence of
Covid-19 and the military takeover has resulted in millions of children and youth now facing
significant challenges in accessing and continuing with their education due to a multitude of complex
factors, particularly the most vulnerable children, with long-lasting consequences for their cognitive
development and their socio-economic futures.
The BBL programme seeks to address the crisis by providing targeted girls and boys, aged 3 to 18 years
old, who have been out of learning and have not yet started or completed a primary level education,
with catch up and remedial education opportunities within their community, with a particular focus
on literacy, numeracy, life skills and Social and Emotional Learning. It seeks to achieve this by: i)
providing girls and boys aged between 3 years old and 18 years old, whose learning has been disrupted,
with access to education literacy, numeracy, and wellbeing support; ii) Ensuring facilitators, CSO resource
persons, and community members are well equipped with relevant capacities and receive appropriate
technical support to deliver context responsive gender sensitive, equity-focused, quality education and
wellbeing support. The BBL Programme has special emphasis on those vulnerable children most likely to
have been impacted by the crisis. This aligns with the Joint Response Framework2 (JRF) objective of
ensuring that children and youth in Myanmar re-engage in quality, meaningful, inclusive and gender
responsive learning in safe, protective environments, with a particular focus on the most vulnerable
learners such as children from Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), migrant communities, ethnic
minorities and girls and boys with disabilities or developmental delays and adolescent girls.
The BBL Programme operates under the modalities of the BBL were developed to be in accordance with
general guidelines for with the United Nations Country Team (UNCT) guidance3,4 which advise the ‘do no
harm’ principle and embody the spirit of partnership with CSO and NGO. This has placed an emphasis
on implementing activities through alternative modalities including partnering with International Non
Government Organisations (INGO) and National Non Government Organisations (NNGO), community-
based organizations and CSOs, whilst not excluding any child from accessing services. The BBL
Programme has a wide geographic focus being active in 14 regions with high deprivation, and 199
townships throughout Myanmar. NGO/CSO selected as implementation partners are responsible for
strengthening and delivering education services in accordance with separate Implementation Partner (IP)
agreements.
Sources of funding include Japan, Norway, Global Partnership for Education (GPE), Korea
International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) as
AusAID. During 2021 to 2022 GPE funds were utilised to implement the BBL. UNICEF and DFAT signed
an agreement in February 2022 to enable utilisation of DFAT funding from June 2022 to June 2023.

4 In non-government-controlled areas (NGCAs), education is provided through a range of non-state education service
providers such as monastic schools and ethnic education working groups and departments. The guidelines
stipulate limited engagement with DFA and on implementing activities through alternative modalities including
partnering with INGO/NNGO, community-based organizations and CSOs, whilst not excluding any child from
accessing services.

Scope, Objectives, Purpose, Methodology
The BBL Evaluation objectives and scope are described in the Terms of Reference (TOR) (annex A). The
BBL Evaluation is commissioned by the UNICEF Myanmar Country Office (MCO) who are also the
responsible managing authority for the evaluation. Following the TOR, the BBL Evaluation is carried out
as an independent exercise by the evaluation team, led by an international consultant working in
conjunction with a national consultant and enumerators to implement the evaluation.
Consistent with the United Nations (UN) Evaluation Norms and Standards (2016), the purpose of
this evaluation was formative and summative. The formative component responds to the evaluation
questions which are clustered under Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
Development Assistance Committee (DAC)5,6 and United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) criteria of
relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability and Gender and Inclusion. The summative
evaluation attempts to draw conclusions as to the likely possibility of the BBL achieving its objective and
outcomes. The evaluation matrix presented in this report connects evaluation questions to data collection
tools and methods employed through this evaluation and is thematically aligned with UNEG
standards/criteria?.
The purpose of the BBL Evaluation was to: i) provide evidence on how the programme has progressed as
envisaged initially; ii) Determine whether the processes have effectively contributed to its stated objectives
and achieved the intended results during that period. The BBL evaluation specific objectives are: i) Identify
how processes contribute to the results by understanding the achievements to date; ii) Provide secondary
evidence on the Theory of Change (TOC), and the extent to which project objectives have been reached;
iii) Determine the relevance of the various strategies in meeting the education needs of children in a dual
crisis situation; iv) To evaluate the approach towards Gender equality, disability, and social inclusion
(GEDSI) within the context of the twin crisis and deprivation experienced throughout Myanmar. Other
considerations included: i) The way each of the involved partners has fulfilled their part of the initiative’s
obligations; ii) How communities and partners have collaborated to reach the project’s objectives; iii)
Provide additional qualitative and quantitative evidence of fulfillment/nonfulfillment of the project’s
objectives. The BBL evaluation scope included all IP agreements and the period from June 2021 to June
2023. Users of the BBL evaluation include the BBL programme’s main implementing partners and
stakeholders including donors of the project BBL
The evaluation was guided by the UNICEF’s internal Evaluation Policies (2018)7 and the UNEG guidance,
norms and ethical standards, A theory-based approach was adopted which employed non-experimental,
mixed methods approach drawing on key project documents, the BBL TOC and the BBL Phase I workplan
and Phase II monitoring framework for guidance. The evaluation team ensured a human rights-based
approach (HRBA) was applied throughout the evaluation process. A mixed methods approach was used to
consolidate the findings from qualitative and quantitative evidence gathered from multiple sources8.
The BBL evaluation was comprehensively informed by information derived from Key Informant Interviews
(KII), Focal Group Discussions (FGD), Site Inspection and Case Studies. In total 264 separate primary
data collection instances were used to inform the BBL evaluation and over 700 respondents participated
giving their views, opinions and sharing their experiences. A total of 50 centres were surveyed in 11

regions, covering 21 districts and 30 townships. 22 case studies of participants in the BBL were conducted
across five regions. This comprehensive approach allowed for a good cross section of the BBL programme
throughout both phases. Throughout, rigorous data protection and privacy protocols were observed and
the evaluation complied fully with UNICEF’s detailed Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation, Data
Collection and Analysis.
Conclusions
Relevance
The objectives and implementation strategies of the BBL programme have been highly consistent
with the requirements of the target groups and country needs resulting from the twin crisis which have
left millions of children throughout Myanmar without access to education. The BBL’s composite approach
to community and home-based learning for children aged 3-18 provides a synergistic effect to support
engagement with key target groups with a focus on disadvantaged children. The BBL provides
opportunities for remedial and catchup learning for children through the delivery of ECCD, Open Learning
and NFE learning opportunities. Project areas were chosen to include townships that were severely
impacted by the conflict and crisis both thematically and geographical for both phases and in which
education services had been disrupted and were not available. The inclusion of Mental Health and
Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) and Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse and Harassment
(PSEAH) were included to help address and mitigate some of the negative impacts of the twin crisis on
children and provided a sound support towards inclusive education.
The BBL aligned with the needs identified in key policy and strategic documents and is aligned with the
Humanitarian Response Plan (2021), with the Socio-Economic Resilience and Response Plan (SERRP),
the approach defined in the Myanmar Education Cluster Strategy (MECS) (2022 to 2025), and the needs
identified in the Political Economy Analysis (PEA)9. The implementation strategies were designed to be
flexible to meet the needs of different communities based on location within the general framework
and resource constraints of the BBL. There is evidence of strong community engagement through
Education Committees whose capacity was developed throughout the BBL. This helped ensure that the
BBL was flexibly adapted and localised to the needs of communities throughout Myanmar.
Coherence
The BBL complemented and fit with community level activities to advocate home and community
level learning among children. Anecdotal evidence indicated the BBL promoted positive behaviours for
children which has helped them engage with each other, parents and the community and to adapt during
and after the dramatic effect of the twin crisis. Community demonstrated commitment through
contribution of resources including the provision of materials, supplementing facilitator wages and
feeding children.
There was no overlap between programmes operated by different development partners or between
Ips. Coordination mechanisms such as the Education Cluster Group and UNICEF planning meetings
helped ensure there was no overlap. Opportunities were identified for potential future synergy such as
complementing the BBL with child feeding programmes, pro poor support and basic literacy programmes.
Efficiency
Fund transfers, banking and supplying materials were problematic owing to limitations imposed by
the crisis, especially during the first year of the BBL (first part of Phase I). Limitations on transfers were
imposed by SAC and IP had to undertake time consuming processes to accommodate restrictions.
UNICEF and IP demonstrated determination, flexibility and adaptability throughout to overcome
9 Restricted access
Page 13 of 163
most problems. Resulting delays did impact the ability of some IP to coordinate activities as many were
on Programme Documents (PD) with durations of between 6 months to 18 months and therefore small
delays were consequential.
The evaluation determined that resources such as human resources, time, expertise, supplies,
transportation, and funds had been effectively allocated and used to achieve the BBL objectives.
UNICEF demonstrated flexibility in repurposing materials for the BBL. There were areas where efficiency
was impacted by events largely beyond the BBL’s control such as increased transportation costs and delays
owing to the need to circumvent restrictions and conflict areas.
The cost per child (unit cost) for Phase I were ECCD (36 USD), Open Learning (71 USD) and NFE (149
USD). The average cost per child for Phase I was 71 USD per child and for Phase II 56 USD per child10.
These figures compare favourably with comparative programmes undertaken in Myanmar. The BBL is a
cost-effective means of delivering education services to disadvantaged communities and in many
communities provides the only means of educating children. Ultimately the costs of the BBL were
justified as the cost of not educating children during the twin crisis and afterwards would have long reaching
socio-economic impacts on society and on GDP growth in future years.
The BBL has contributed to reengagement of children to learning at community level although most
evidence is currently anecdotal. Phase II aims to provide more robust empirical evidence relating to
learning outcomes.
Effectiveness and Impact
Phase I targets were exceeded for most indicators. Overall the number of children accessing formal
and non-formal education, including early learning exceeded the Phase I target of (110%) but there was
variation between learning pathways with ECCD (348%) exceeding the target and Open Learning (74%)
and NFE (38%) falling below the target. Phase II budget was defined adequately ex ante in terms of
total beneficiaries reached which were significantly exceeded in all outputs. The outreach
programme proved a cost effective means of reaching more children in satellite communities as
demonstrated by the target being exceeded by 130% (229% of the original target). In some cases
resources committed were inadequate to cope with the high demand and inadequate resources were
committed to more comprehensively address the challenging area of CWD. In all an estimated total of
209,340 children (GPI 1.03) were reached by the BBL Phase I and II11.
The BBL strategy and programme management have been steering towards impact and set up in a
way to allow achievement of expected outcomes and impacts. Phase II has a more clearly defined
strategy towards measuring outcomes and towards ensuring sustainability. Anecdotal evidence and
limited assessment data undertaken by some IP also indicate that the BBL is helping address the
learning crisis.
Sustainability (and Scalability)
Implementation during dual crisis and short project time frame have significant effect on
sustainability as the projects address immediate needs of children education and subsequently
focus falls more on effectiveness. Phase I BBL was extended into phase II and then scaled through
Quality basic Education Programme for children (QBEP4C). The sustainability strategy is to ensure
continuity of learning for all children. A realistic and effective exit strategy, unsurprisingly has not
10 Costs were determined by dividing the total amount allocated to a phase or learning stream by the total number of
children benefiting under that phase or learning stream. For phase II budget was not available disaggregated by
learning stream. Therefore phase II unit costs do not reflect the costs for each individual learning stream which
are likely to reflect Phase I costs.

been developed for the BBL but is included in the Phase II strategy as an objective. Some
communities had concluded implementation under Phase I without an exit strategy. Amongst IP there was
a lack of uniformity in approach towards exit planning. It will be important to define what an exit strategy
means and how it relates to sustainability. Sustainability will be improved if aspects of library centres can
be coordinated with SAC policies and legislation such as the ECCD law (2014)12.
There are many scalable elements inherent in the approach to the BBL which may be implemented
during phase III. Trainers have been established at the regional and state level, IP have capacity
developed to implement the programme and reusable materials have been developed such as open
learning materials and training materials. These elements of the BBL mean that the cost of implementing
in new centres can be reduced thus reducing the cost per child in each of the three learning pathways being
ECCD, Open Learning and NFE. However operational costs, renovation, capacity development and
material supply costs at the learning centre would remain constant.
Gender Equality, Disability, Social Inclusion (GEDSI)
The design of the BBL reflected UNICEF’s extensive experience in all aspects of GEDSI as it relates
to children and vulnerable populations. The BBL was inclusive and promoted inclusivity across each
category of GEDSI. Data on outputs by GEDSI category were reported. However, limited data concerning
the financial, output (in terms of categories of CwD) and outcomes relating to each category of GEDSI
prohibited a full understanding of the capacity of BBL to address issues of GEDSI.
Phase II had greater allocation of resources towards GEDSI but resources were limited when
compared to the high demand. Gender was adequately addressed but the challenging area of CWD was
only partially addressed through the BBL. There is significant scope to further address issues relating to
GEDSI and to align the BBL with programmes or mechanisms providing pro poor support such as Social
Policy and Child Rights Monitoring (SPCRM) cash transfers to poor families.
12,743 (GPI 1.02) ethnic children were recorded in Chin, Kachin, Kayin, Kayah and Mon being 6% of the
total number of children estimated to have been reached by the BBL. The The BBL was able to reach 849
Children with Disabilities (CwD) between 2021 and 2023 of which 351 of the targets of 462 (76%) were
reached in Phase II. BBL Phase I and II aimed to assist children with sight and hearing impediments.
There was inadequate budget allocated to fully address the issue of CWD as indicated by the low
participation rate of CWD. The barriers towards identification and participation of CWD are significant
and may require a greater contribution of resources, and a more wholistic approach, to properly address.
Inclusivity and acceptance were also emphasized through aspects of the BBL such as MHPSS,
PSEAH and Non-Formal Primary Education, community based Extended and Continuous Learning
and Education (EXCEL) Pathways and Life-Skills training and these had a positive impact on the
attitude of children, parents and facilitators. Inclusivity was also emphasised through many aspects of
the BBL such as the provision of books in ethnic languages, facilitators fluent in local languages and
renovation of facilities to include gendered toilets and disability friendly facilities. However limited
resources impacted the degree to which GEDSI could be fully addressed as in the case of CWD.
Some gains towards GEDSI are likely to be maintained, such as the provision of audio materials,
but greater evidence should be obtained to confirm long term outcomes and to assess
sustainability. Aspects which are likely to be sustained include: i) Positive attitudinal changes concerning
inclusion amongst parents, facilitators and communities which help promote participation in learning for
vulnerable and marginalized children; ii) ECCD being taught partly in local ethnic languages and with
access to story books in the local ethnic languages.; iii) Renovations to learning centers which promote

1.2 Background and Context
1.1.1. Country Context
The Union of Myanmar is geographically situated in Southeast Asia, bounded on the north and northeast
by the People’s Republic of China, on the east and southeast by the Lao’s People Democratic Republic
and the Kingdom of Thailand, on the south by the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal and on the west by
the People’s Republic of Bangladesh and the Republic of India. Myanmar with a land area of 676,553
square kilometres is the largest country in mainland Southeast Asia. The Union of Myanmar is
administratively divided into seven states and seven regions and one union territory (Nay Pyi Taw).
According to census, the total population is estimated at 55 million (55,335,883) as of 202213; of which there
are 93.02 males per 100 females (GPI 1.08) and comprised of 135 ethnic groups. Myanmar has favourable
demographics with the median age being 29.0 years. Most people live in rural areas (78.6 percent) Only
31.4 percent of the population is urban (17,068,066 people in 2020). The annual population growth rate is
2 percent14.
Myanmar has been subject to significant political and social upheaval in recent years. During February
2021, a military takeover d’état in Myanmar occurred when the democratically elected members of the
country’s ruling party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), were deposed by the Tatmadaw,
Myanmar’s military, which then vested power in a military junta15. In addition, Covid-19 was confirmed to
have reached Myanmar on 23 March 2020. Although the government rapidly implemented containment
measures and public health responses, the country had experienced one of the most severe Covid-19
outbreaks in Southeast Asia by late 202016. The UN raised concerns about Myanmar’s vulnerability to the
pandemic due to its weak healthcare infrastructure following poor investment over six decades of military
rule, as well as ongoing internal conflict17. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was estimated to be 78.93 billion
USD in 202018. However, the pandemic and the political upheaval have greatly disrupted the country’s
economy and Myanmar’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) shrank by 5% to 65.09 Billion in 2021 and to have
contracted a further 3% during 202219. It is estimated that 65.4 per cent of the population is engaged in the
agricultural sector, 14.0 per cent in the industrial sector and 20.6 per cent in the services sector.

Poor education and poverty are closely associated, and education can be an effective means of raising
people out of poverty20. A recent poverty estimate based on 2015 living conditions released by the Ministry
of Planning and Finance and the World Bank finds that poverty is estimated at 32 per cent in 201521.
Poverty in Myanmar’s rural areas is substantially higher than that in its urban areas: 38.8 per cent of the
rural population are estimated to be poor compared to 14.5 per cent of those in its towns and cities. Further,
poverty remains geographically spread in Myanmar: in the coastal and mountainous areas, 4 in 10 of the
population are poor and 1 in 6 will struggle to meet their basic food needs, while 65 per cent of the poor
live in the Dry Zone and Delta.
1.1.2. Myanmar Education System
Schooling is compulsory in Myanmar until the end of the elementary (primary) level, or approximately to
age 9, while at the international level it is compulsory up to age 16. There are 3,830 high schools, 14,280
middle schools and 27,871 primary schools, or a total of 45,981 basic education schools. Just over 41,000
of these are in rural areas22. Nearly all are government operated, although there has been a recent increase
in private schools. Monastic schools operate under the supervision of the Ministry of Religious Affairs and
some ethnic schools run by ethnic communities also provide the national basic education curriculum. In
principle, primary school is free and lasts five years, from age 5 to 9.
Until 2015, Myanmar had a “5:4:2” formal education structure, where primary school lasted for five grades.
This broke down into lower primary (grades 1 to 3) and upper primary (grades 4 to 5). The first grade was
also be referred to as “reception year” or “kindergarten” (KG). Secondary school was divided into two
“cycles”: lower secondary consisted of grades 6 through 9 and upper secondary consisted of grades 10
through 11. Lower secondary was also referred to as “middle school” and upper secondary as “high school.”
Students sat for an exam at the end of Grade 5 and at the end of Grade 9, as well as the Basic Education
High School Exam at the end of upper secondary.
For those continuing on to higher education, there are 48 universities and degree colleges under MOE, 24
teaching colleges and 60 technology and computer universities; there are 26 universities under other
ministries. There are also 33 technical schools (Myanmar DTVET, March 2017), 25 nursing schools, 22
midwifery schools and 4 sports academies (Myanmar Ministry of Health and Sports [MOHS] 2017).
A high-level representation of the structure of the education system in Myanmar is presented in the diagram
below23. As part of the educational reform outlined in the National Education Sector Plan (NESP) 2016-
202124, the Myanmar Ministry of Education has introduced a new basic education curriculum, which is being
implemented gradually alongside the restructuring of the school grades. It is not clear whether the education
reform has been continued under the current government.

23 The existing basic education system structure is undergoing a reform cycle restructuring the previous/current five
years of primary education, four years of middle school and two years of high school (5-4-2) to a KG+12 structure.
Inclusion of Kindergarten in the formal education structure means that children start in grade 1, one year later than
in the previous structure (from age 5 to age 6).

Figure 1. Overview of Myanmar school system structure25
Technical and vocational education and training in Myanmar is provided by relevant ministries (MoE and
Ministry of Science and Technology (MoST)) and the private sector through approximately 372 technical
and vocational education and training centres. For adults in the general public, the MOE provides some
access to alternative education through a Non-Formal Primary Education Equivalency Programme (NFPE)
for out of school children and a Summer Basic Literacy Programme (SBLP).
1.3 Impact of Recent Events on Education
Prior to 2021, conflict affected several states in Myanmar, including Kachin, Northern Shan and Rakhine.
The previous government was working to accelerate efforts in the peace process under the leadership of
State Counsellor26,27. These efforts were largely halted in 2021 when, on February 1st, Myanmar armed
forces (the Tatmadaw) staged a military takeover declaring fraud in the November 2020 multiparty general
election won by the National League for Democracy. A year-long state of emergency was ordered which
was extended to the current date. In addition, COVID-19 was confirmed to have reached Myanmar on 23
March 202028. Although the government rapidly implemented containment measures and public health

responses, the country had experienced one of the most severe COVID-19 outbreaks in Southeast Asia by
late 202029, 30 (refer timeline in Annex 4).
When the COVID-19 pandemic hit Myanmar in March 2020, all organized education services for children
were largely halted, impacting 12.5 million children, including 2.8 million children aged 3-5 years, and 9.7
million school aged children31. Alternative education services such as Non-formal Primary Education
(NFPE) and Non-Formal Middle School Education (NFMSE) supported by the Ministry of Education (MoE)
were also closed and, as a result, 8,000 children who would otherwise had been enrolled in non-formal
education have also been out of learning32.
Before COVID, the challenges for education were significant with an estimated 2.3 million of children aged
5 – 18 years out of school33. The confluence of COVID19 and the military takeover has resulted in millions
of children and youth now facing significant challenges in accessing and continuing with their education
due to a multitude of complex factors, particularly the most vulnerable children with long-lasting
consequences for their cognitive development and their socio-economic futures34.
The Ministry of Education (MoE) under the De Facto Authorities (DFA) commenced reopening of schools
as of 1 November 2021. However, as of mid-2022 this had not happened in all areas and thousands of
schools and other learning facilities remained closed. Many schools which had opened were subject to
closure owing to COVID-19, conflict, community tensions, and the impacts of natural hazards such as
flooding35. As of mid-2022, and according to different sources, only 3.5 million student being approximately
a quarter of the total36 were back in MoE schools37. Hundreds of thousands of students were studying
through Ethnic Based Education Providers and some others were receiving education in Temporary
Learning Centres (TLCs) and monastic schools, but a large but unknown number of children were still out
of education entirely and the situation is unlikely to have improved significantly by the end of 2022.
Enrolment rates vary significantly across the different states and regions of Myanmar. A significant
proportion of the population were choosing not to send their children to formal schools due to concerns
around safety and security, and COVID-19.

following poor investment over six decades of military rule, as well as ongoing internal conflict.

1.4 Learning Challenge38
A learning crisis existed in Myanmar even before the prolonged school closure due to COVID-19,
exacerbated by the military takeover on 1 February 2021. Across Myanmar, 2.7 million children were out
of school prior to the crisis and have not completed primary education39. The South-East Asia Primary
Learning Metrics (SEA-PLM) 2019 assessment showed that 60 percent of grade 5 children in Myanmar
were in the lowest proficiency band for reading40. Poor learning outcomes for children, especially children
from minority groups and children with disabilities, is also confirmed by findings from both the Early Grade
Reading Assessment and Early Grade Mathematics Assessment. At the national level, it was estimated
that less than 30 percent of grade 3 students in government schools achieve fluency in reading grade-
appropriate text in the Myanmar language41. In 2018, UNICEF reported that 47 percent of CwD were out-
of-school with the analysis indicating that education outcomes for girls with a disability were worse than
those for boys with disabilities. With almost two years of learning loss for most children in Myanmar,
the gaps are expected to be far greater now.
1.5 Impact of Recent Events on Donor Support and Funding
Since the military takeover and the ensuing political crisis, the majority of partner engagement with the
Ministry of Education (MoE)/Ministry of Science and Technology (MoST) has been paused. While it is widely
recognized that there are increasing needs to support the continuity of learning, the complex political and
operational environment characterized by an increased politicization of education and a deteriorated
security situation, makes education partners’ interventions extremely challenging42. A full timeline of events
and challenges is presented in Annex 4.
In response, education partners have developed a joint education response framework to respond to the
educational needs arising from the prolonged learning crisis exacerbated by the military takeover in a
coordinated, coherent and transparent way. The overall objective of the Joint Response Framework43 (JRF)
is to “ensure that children and youth in Myanmar re-engage in quality, meaningful, inclusive and gender
responsive learning in safe, protective environments, with a particular focus on the most vulnerable learners
such as children from IDPs, migrant communities, and ethnic minority and girls and boys with disabilities or
developmental delays and adolescent girls.” The JRF is informed by six existing documents: The 2021
Myanmar Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP); Myanmar Interim Emergency Response Plan (June –

The Myanmar Education Cluster Strategy (MECS) provides further direction concerning the needs,
response activities, and collective Cluster priorities for the three-year period from 2022 to 2025. It provides
a common approach and operational plan among Education Cluster partners throughout Myanmar to
prepare for and respond to the emerging humanitarian crisis. The MECS provides a guiding framework
which articulates the education related humanitarian needs, identifies the scope of interventions required
to help address the crisis and defines areas for collaboration between stakeholders
The BBL programme commenced in June 2021, prior to the drafting of the partner strategies, and helped
inform the strategic approach adopted by partners through the MECS and JRF48. However, despite coming
first, the BBL Programme also operates under the general umbrella of the MECS/JRF and falls within the
same structure49 (refer below).
1.1 Bringing Back Learning (BBL)
1.5.1 BBL Rationale
Following the military takeover, UNICEF transitioned from a programme that mainly provided upstream
support to the government to ensuring humanitarian response was delivered through Community Based
Organisations (CBOs) and national and international non-governmental organisations (NGO). The
modalities of the BBL were developed to be in accordance with general guidelines for with the United
Nations Country Team (UNCT) guidance50,51 which advise the ‘do no harm’ principle and embody the spirit
of partnership with CSO and NGO (p8). The broad objectives for the BBL Programme were to52: i)
Strengthen community capacity to support children to continue learning to make education
services more resilient at the grassroots level though community libraries, hubs, and community
learning centres53; ii) Support children, including girls and boys and children with disabilities, with
foundational skills of literacy, numeracy and Social Emotional Learning (SEL), with Mental Health and
Psychosocial Support (MHPSS); iii) Support adolescents, including girls and boys and CWD, with
literacy, numeracy and SEL and primary equivalency programmes; iv) Ensure children have access to
relevant, inclusive, gender-sensitive learning materials with a focus on children aged between 5 and

51 In non-government-controlled areas (NGCAs), education is provided through a range of non-state education service
providers such as monastic schools and ethnic education working groups and departments. The guidelines
stipulate limited engagement with DFA and on implementing activities through alternative modalities including
partnering with INGO/NNGO, community-based organizations and CSOs, whilst not excluding any child from
accessing services.

10 years of age54 and on teaching and learning materials focused on literacy, numeracy and Social and
Emotional Learning (SEL); v) Focus on Gender Equality, Disability and Social Inclusion and to mitigate
safety and security concerns as much as possible; vi) Monitor children’s learning outcomes adapted to
the challenges prevalent in Myanmar; vii) Tackle COVID-19 and ensure safe learning spaces with the
provision adequate Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) facilities and practices and Information,
Education and Communication (IEC) materials on COVID-19 prevention.
1.5.2 BBL General Approach, Principals and Assumptions
In response to the challenges and under the operational modalities and objectives of the JRF, the BBL
undertook an approach which included: i) Community libraries, community learning centres ‘hubs’ as a
key approach to support all children to catch-up and continue learning; ii) Opportunity for replication and
outreach building on upgradation of library hubs for replication in other communities that have an interest
in establishing their own library or hub; iii) Community library or hub facilitators being supported with
comprehensive capacity building delivered by trained CSO partners so that they can make the libraries
more effective spaces for learning and ensure implementation of effective COVID-19 prevention measures;
iv) Community mobilisation to encourage parents and caregivers to support learning in which a ‘do no harm’
approach is used to develop a standardised risk-informed community engagement approach; v) Working
with and through CSOs as local partners for implementation of the key interventions.
The key principles of the BBL programme were: i) Consultation with children, parents, communities and
facilitators to hear their voices to decide programme work, including location for learning, modes of delivery,
contents; ii) Safety, well-being and protection of children and facilitators are enablers to support children’s
learning and therefore need to be prioritized; iii) Do no harm; iv) Focus on support to children, not schools;
v) GEDSI.
The assumptions of the BBL Programme were: i) The situation will not get worse in terms of civil unrest;
ii) it is not feasible to rely on facilitators to deliver the teaching; iii) the support to ‘schools’ may be seen as
not neutral. V) structured learning will have to be put (back) in place to enable children in learning and could
be school or home-based and might take some time; v) The first few months are an interim period during
which alternative interim learning opportunities were provided; vi) Schools will gradually reopen but with the
uncertainty of when and how; vi) Civil Society Organizations and community structures will be ready and
willing to cooperate with UNICEF and take up additional/new responsibilities.
1.5.3 BBL TOC and RWF
The BBL TOC (TOC) was developed by UNICEF Myanmar Country Office (MCO) collectively with partners,
and reflects the objectives and modalities of the BBL. The BBL TOC will be used to provide a framework to
help visualize relationships between the different contributions towards the desired outcomes of the BBL.
The BBL Phase II Results framework aligns with the TOC and provides a basis for monitoring progress
towards programme outcomes (refer Annex E). The Results Framework (RWF) gives a thematic
breakdown of outcome areas and outputs and details the baseline, targets and means of verification (MoV)
for each output.
The overall objective of the BBL is to provide targeted girls and boys, aged 3 to 18 years old, who
have been out of learning and have not yet started or completed a primary level education, with
catch up and remedial education opportunities within their community, with a particular focus on
literacy, numeracy, life skills and Social and Emotional Learning. The results framework for Phase
II articulates the objectives being:
54 The age limit would normally be 8 years old but due to lost learning and overaged learners, the BBL Programme
increased the upper age limit to children who are 10 years old.
Page 24 of 163
Objective 1: Provide girls and boys aged between 3 years old and 18 years old, whose learning has been
disrupted, with access to education literacy, numeracy, and wellbeing support.
I. Output 1.1 Girls and boys attend quality education in a protected, inclusive learning environment.
II. Output 1.2 Girls and Boys have access to contextual, inclusive, quality teaching learning materials.
Objective 2: Ensure facilitators, CSO resource persons, and community members are well equipped with
relevant capacities and receive appropriate technical support to deliver context responsive equity-focused,
quality education and wellbeing support.
I. Output 2.1 PTAs/ Community structures strengthened to implement community based strategic
and sustainability plans towards improving learning of children.
II. Output 2.2 Provide mental health and psychosocial support, counselling support to children and
families impacted by conflict.
III. Output 2.3 Girls and Boys access quality education and adolescent learning outcomes are
improved through improved community volunteers well- being and teaching capacity.
The BBL TOC is shown in in the figure below. The BBL TOC aligns with the JRF and MECS, which seeks
to ensure that children and youth in Myanmar re-engage in quality and meaningful learning and training in
safe protective environments, with a particular focus on the most vulnerable learners. It articulates the logic
towards achieving the desired outcomes which are: i) Continuity of expected quality learning including
Life skills and Socio Emotional Learning (SEL) and wellbeing for children and adolescents attained; ii)
Replicable Community Learning Resource Centre model tested and piloted. This is achieved through the
three output areas being: i) Children aged between 3 to 18 years old have continued their learning using
the opportunities provided to them; ii) Facilitators/educators/parents have acquired required capacity and
motivation through the training and resources made available to them; iii) CSO partners and communities
can support continuation and replication of community learning resource centres. The structure of the
TOC does not map directly to the Results Framework objectives specified above but activities
shown in the framework are included in the TOC.
The TOC follows the broad logic that the outputs will be achieved if55, 56: i) Existing community libraries or
learning hubs are supported with technical and material resources to support children’s learning; ii)
Children, especially those aged between 5 and 15 years, can safely access equipped community libraries
or learning hubs; iii) Families and communities are willing to take on responsibilities of motivating their
children to access the education opportunities, and are provided with necessary technical support and
resources to assist their children’s learning and wellbeing; iv) Facilitators are enabled to provide relevant,
quality GEDSI sensitive education support focusing on literacy, numeracy and social emotional learning; v)
CSO partners are supported to provide children, especially those who have experienced substantial
learning discontinuity, with relevant learning and wellbeing support (including Open Learning, MHPSS, life
skills, etc.) and their technical capacities to maintain quality of services are strengthened by dedicated
partners57; vi) Children will have the ability to continue their learning in a safe and protective environment,
which will contribute to meaningful learning, improved learning outcomes and socio-emotional well-being.
The barriers and challenges are highlighted in the TOC being: i) Disruption of learning due to COVID19
and military takeover; ii) Lack of alternative learning resources and opportunities; iii) Economic hardship

motivation of facilitators; viii) Low technical capacity of CSO partners; ix) Deepening learning crisis; x) Lack
of multi-lingual resources; xi) Non-existent/dysfunctional PTAs/VECs; xii) Low monitoring capacity and
mechanisms; xiii) Low parental education and community engagement to support education of children.
The TOC is analysed further as part of Q17 (section 3.4.11).
1.5.4 BBL Phased Approach, RWF and Beneficiaries58
The BBL programme is not a tested approach. It has evolved based on a necessary response to the advent
of the twin crisis in Myanmar and in response to the needs of the children, particularly those most
vulnerable. Therefore, it is anticipated that the RWF may not be as precise and accurate as expected for
programmes occurring in less volatile and evolving situation. UNICEF notes that the RWF has evolved
based upon: i) necessary responses to the fluid crisis situation occurring throughout Myanmar; ii)
experiences from past programming within Myanmar and globally; iii) the changing funding and
engagement of donors throughout the twin crisis; iv) the changing and evolving capacity of IP to operate
within each target region.
The BBL programme can be divided into two distinct but overlapping phases:
Phase I June 2021 to June 2023: Phase I was mainly funded through GPE COVID-19 Accelerated
Funding, although other partners such as Japanese funding, UNICEF Internal and thematic funding, under
the BBL, and is taking place between June 2021 to June 2023. Contracts which commenced during this
time are considered part of Phase I. This phase was characterised by changes in operational modality to
adjust to the ‘new norms’ including school closure from the COVID-19 outbreak and the military takeover.
For the most part this meant building on and further developing relationships with existing partners. IP
agreements were staggered throughout this period. An Annual Work Plan (AWP) was used in place of a
RWF (refer annex D). Some IP agreements had been signed before June 2021 but activities were
redesigned and evolved based on the results to the twin crisis. The BBL Phase I was monitored using a
workplan format rather than a RWF.
Phase II June 2022 – June 2023: Phase II was mainly funded through DFAT funding which was negotiated
between November 2021 and February 2022 and includes contracts which commenced on or after June
2022. This includes new or extended contacts for KBC SM, KMSS, SF and MLRC which commenced after
June 2022. This phase enabled a more structured approach based on operational modalities developed
during phase I. The RWF (Annex E) was developed for Phase II which added 46 townships in 6 regions to
the BBL programme. The BBL Phase II RWF was finalised in April 2022 and is shown in Annex 5.
The evolution of contacts occurred as follows.

1.5.5 BBL Geographic Coverage Phase I and II
Geographic areas were selected based on the following principals: i) The need for flexibility in the selection
of geographical locations due to the rapidly changing security context and to ensure interventions do not
overlap with other funds partners may receive; ii) The need to align with other programmes and ensuring
BBL does not overlap with the areas covered by the GPE Accelerated Fund (AF) and other programmes;
iii) Reaching the most marginalised children by focusing on selected, disadvantaged townships and states
within government-controlled areas; iv) Focusing on selected locations/townships being applied under all
objective areas for increased efficiency, impact, coherence and value for money; v) Prioritizing locations
where there were existing libraries or “hubs”62; working in areas where Implementation Partners (IP) CSOs
have existing operations. For Phase I and II, the geographic focus was in 14 regions and 198 townships
during 2022 (refer data annex F)63.
For Phase II, the geographic focus has been in 6 regions and 47 townships throughout Myanmar. Regions
include: Sagaing (13 townships); Chin (4 townships); Ayeyarwardy (10 townships); Mandalay (2 townships);
Magway (12 townships); Bago (6 townships)..
1.5.6 BBL Partnerships
Implementation partners (IP) are the recipients of funds and are responsible for strengthening and
delivering education services within each area in accordance with the signed partnership agreement.
Partners were identified by UNICEF based on: i) existing working relationship; ii) those who are already
operating active community libraries or “hubs” and had supported additional innovations that enable these
hubs to offer support and opportunities that are more structured, while remaining supplementary to and
non-duplicative of formal systems; iii) Partners active in areas determined to be deprived (refer annex G).
IP agreements were developed as: Programme Documents (PD); Humanitarian Programme Documents
(HPD); and Small scale funding agreement (SSFA). These are summarised in annex F.
Partnership modalities follow: i) ‘Guidance for Civil Society Organizations on Partnership with UNICEF’64;
In line with L2 emergency procedures, single source partnerships, with existing trusted partners, were
utilised; Partnership Cooperation Arrangement (PCA) were used; Timely delivery of products assessed
through field monitoring and review of reports as well as client satisfaction assessments; Consultation with
communities; Participation in the Programme Coordination Committee (PCC); Utilization of funds and

62 According to consultations held so far with CSOs that are supporting community libraries, e.g. Myanmar Book Aid
and Preservation Fund and Succor Foundation, there are about 157 active community libraries across different States
and Regions in Myanmar. Of these, about 100 have been tentatively identified as potential hosts of the planned
community learning hubs and these are located across the country. Townships where these 100 community libraries
are located will therefore be deliberately targeted.
63 Regions/States are: Mon, Ayeyarwady, Bago (East), Bago (West), Chin, Kachin, Kayah, Kayin, Magway, Mandalay,

proposal to DFAT (2022)65.
Sources of funding include Japan, Norway, Global Partnership for Education (GPE), Korea International
Cooperation Agency (KOICA), and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) as AusAID., Phase I
was funded by GPE COVID and other partners. The majority of the funds for Phase II were committed by
DFAT from June 2022 to June 2023. Funds have been committed to partners through the IP agreements
with varying start and end dates for each partner as shown in the graph below (refer annex F). Partners
issued contracts for Phase II were also operating during Phase I but these are not shown in the graph below
(being KBC SM, KMSS, and SF).
Participants included under Phase II contracts included the following programmes which were all renewed;
i) Karuna Mission Social Solidarity (KMSS) Providing learning opportunities to children (25/11/2021 -
30/06/2023); ii) Myanmar Literacy Resource Centre (MLRC), Capacity building to NGO partners on Non-
Formal Education Bring Back Learning to Children (15/10/2021 - 21/07/2023); iii) KBC Social Mission,

Funds allocated to each partner through the IP contracts are shown in Annex F and totalling $11,910,611
USD equivalent66. Four partners have been contracted the bulk of the funds being: Karuna Mission Social
Solidarity KMSS, 2,816,200 USD, 22.5%; Succor Foundation, 2,391,441 USD, 19.1%; Myanmar Baptist
Convention, 2,199,900 USD, 17.5%; Kachin Baptist Convention KBC 996,999 USD, 8.0%.
As of April 2023, Phase II BBL expenditure was 3.2M USD of 4.6M USD being 70% utilisation67.
1.5.7 BBL and Innovation
In accordance with UNICEF’s global education strategy68, the BBL has been designed to foster and
encourage innovation including: i) reaching the most disadvantaged through outreach, and reasonable
adaptations to hubs to accommodate Children with Disability (CwDs) and improve COVID-19 prevention
measures; ii) Using hubs to facilitate community outreach to neighbouring villages, in order to reach more
children, and assist with replication and expansion in future programmes; iii) Providing capacity building in
the development of individual learning plans, particularly for children requiring the most support; iv)
Expanding open learning in multiple formats, and online and offline modalities, to better support CwDs
and children in areas where parents may have low functional literacy in Myanmar language; v) Piloting of

2 Purpose, Objectives, Scope and Methodology of the
evaluation
2.1 BBL evaluation Purpose, Objectives and Scope
The Terms of Reference (TOR) set out the purpose, objectives, methodology and operational modalities
for an individual consultancy to evaluate the Bringing Back Learning programme to improve and
strengthen its implementation (refer annex A).
The purpose of the BBL evaluation was defined by the nature of the BBL programme which has been
to support learning for children in Myanmar during a period of crisis and in which development partners
have limited interaction with the government. The purposes were therefore to:
i) Provide evidence on how the programme has progressed as envisaged initially;
ii) Determine whether the BBL processes have effectively contributed to its stated objectives
and achieved the intended results during that period.
The justifications for the evaluation were to learn and apply lessons and knowledge: i) To help inform
future partner programming in Myanmar as defined in the JRF; ii) Towards programming in similar
environments elsewhere globally; iii) Towards the possible expansion of the BBL following the
conclusion of the current funding in June 2023; iv) to learn and apply lessons and other aspects, such
as innovations, which can be applied in Myanmar and elsewhere; v) To evaluate the approach towards
GEDSI which is mainstreamed throughout the BBL.
The specific objectives of the evaluation were to:
i) Understanding of achievements to date will be necessary to identify how processes
contribute to the results;
ii) Provide secondary evidence on the TOC, and the extent to which project objectives have
been reached;
iii) The relevance of the various strategies in meeting the education needs of children in a dual
crisis situation.
iv) To evaluate the approach towards GEDSI within the context of the twin crisis and deprivation
experienced throughout Myanmar.
Considerations for the evaluation included: i) the way each of the involved partners has fulfilled their
part of the initiatives obligations; ii) how communities and partners have collaborated to reach the
project’s objectives; iii) provide additional qualitative and quantitative evidence of
fulfillment/nonfulfillment of the project’s objectives; iv) Diversity in approach to implementing the BBL
throughout Myanmar; v) Focus on vulnerable persons; Special consideration for the crisis situation and
for enumerators during the evaluation process; vi) A focus on the operational modalities, organisational
modalities and utilisation of funds in the context of responding to a humanitarian crisis.
The primary audience for the evaluation was the BBLs main Implementing Partners (IP) and
stakeholders including donors of the project BBL. Secondary audiences included those stakeholders
who may have received information at UNICEF’s discretion such as information on lessons learned from
the BBL evaluation, including: implementation partners and beneficiaries such as community
representatives, Facilitators and parents and caregivers.
The scope of the evaluation was to assess the Bringing Back Learning programme over the entire project
period and across different funding, from June 2021 to June 2023 and covered the geographic locations
of all IP agreements. The scope included interaction with the donors, UNICEF, the Implementation
Partners and beneficiaries of the BBL. Geographically the scope included all regions under the BBL
although specific regions were selected for primary data collection from centres.

2.2 Methodology and Approach
The BBL evaluation was adapted to consider conflicts continuing throughout Myanmar during
the period of the evaluation field work.
Evaluation questions were clustered under OECD/DAC criteria of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency,
and sustainability (2009) and71 GENSI (2010) 72 and were derived from the TOR (refer annex A).
Evaluation Questions are shown in the Evaluation Matrix (refer annex B).
The evaluation was guided by the UNICEF’s revised Evaluation Policy (2018)73, the United Nations
Evaluation Group (UNEG) Norms and Standards for Evaluation (2016)74, UNEG Guidance on Integrating
71 OECD Guidelines for Project and Programme Evaluations (Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development

(2020)76, UNICEF Procedure for Ethical Standards and Research77, Evaluation and Data Collection and
Analysis (2021) and UNICEF-Adapted UNEG Evaluation Report Standards (2017)78. Moreover, the
evaluation considered throughout issues of equity, gender equality and human rights. The evaluation
considered triangulation, sampling, ethical considerations (including, ethical clearance) and
methodological limitations and mitigation measures.
Consistent with the United Nations (UN) Evaluation Norms and Standards (2016), the purpose of this
evaluation was formative and summative. The formative component responded the evaluation questions
The summative attempted to draw conclusions as to the likely possibility of the BBL achieving its
objective and outcomes. The evaluation matrix presented in annex B connected evaluation questions
to data collection tools and methods employed through this evaluation and is thematically aligned with
UNEG.
As envisioned in the TOR (annex 1), a theory-based approach was adopted. The evaluation employed
non-experimental, mixed methods approach drawing on key project documents, the BBL TOC and the
BBL Phase I workplan and Phase II monitoring framework for guidance. The BBL evaluation team
ensured a human rights-based approach (HRBA) was applied throughout the evaluation process. A
mixed methods approach was used to consolidate the findings from qualitative and quantitative evidence
gathered from multiple sources79. The evaluation utilised a focused, non-experimental design, utilising
the following methods:
1. Literature review of background documents and other relevant data including a literature review of
implementation partner reports and BBL financing and design documents. Literature referenced is
contained in the footnotes to this report.
2. Review of the external environment influencing BBL including other partner programmes and
reports, the external environment and education sector data.
3. Analysis of Secondary Data
a) Financial Process and Cost-effectiveness analysis by reviewing results of a country survey
containing questions on development and operational budget.
b) Data on enrolments, learning outcomes, Facilitators trained, Learning centers equipped
and other available data as presented in this report and supplied by the UNICEF BBL Data
Team.
4. Collection and analysis of primary data through key discussions, site visits to learning centers,
informant interviews, consisting of the following:
2.3 Primary Data Collection and Respondents/Participants
Primary data collection was derived using 6 tools designed as KII, FGD, Site Inspection and Case Study
as shown in the table below. All IPs were interviewed for the evaluation and all UNICEF sub-national
offices active in the BBL were also interviewed being located in Hakha, Rakhine, Taunggyi. In total 264
separate primary data collection instances were used to inform the BBL evaluation (refer table below).
Participation in all primary data collection instances was voluntary. The sampling for primary data

collection was purposive, ensuring appropriate representation of each respondent group and
beneficiaries of each output area for the BBL programme and allowing for issues relating to travel and
security80.
Primary data collection derived from centres supported by the BBL is summarised in Annex G. 50 centres
were surveyed in 11 regions of which 43 were visited by enumerators and 7 were reviewed via webchat.
Regions covered included: Ayeyarwaddy; Bago; Chin State; Kayin; Magway; Mandalay; Rakhine;
Sagaing; Shan State (Eastern); Shan State (South); Tanintharyi. Centres were located in 21 districts
and 30 townships allowing for a good cross section of the BBL programme throughout both phases.
Centres assisted by seven (7) implementation partners were surveyed including: Succor Foundation (10
townships); KBC (4 townships), KBC SM (1 township); KMSS (6 townships); World Vision (2 townships);
MBC (6 townships); BADA (1 township).

Minorities (2); 5 as CWD (5); and 8 from Poor families (8). All case studies expressed positive change
as a result of the BBL.
KII and FGD primary data were analysed for positive or negative responses and noted during
narration. The frequency of positive and negative responses were noted where required and referenced
in the final analysis. Judgements for inclusion of responses were made based on frequency and: a) the
extent to which qualitative and/or quantitative evidence generated from different sources point to the
same conclusion, and b) the quality of the individual data and/or source of evidence as determined by
reliability/completeness of response and capacity of the respondent to make an assessment or offer an
opinion. Triangulation was used as a key tool for validating and analysing findings. Analysis
included: Results analysis; Analysis of the BBL programme coherence; Gender sensitivity and
vulnerable person responsiveness, and transformative analysis; Analysis of Equity with special
attention to equal access to basic social services with special attention to different vulnerability
factors: Assumption analysis applied through a systematic analysis of the assumptions and hypothesis
presented in the overall TOC.
2.4 Evaluation Matrix
To ensure consistency during the data collection and analysis, an Evaluation Matrix was developed
based on the key questions presented in the TOR (refer Annex A). The evaluation matrix defined the
evaluation questions, key criteria considerations, main sources of information, and data collection and
analysis tools. The following are important criteria when considering the evaluation matrix: i) Some
questions are summative in nature and also relate to conclusions and recommendations, but responded
under the appropriate question heading in the final report; ii) Child rights and protection of both children
and adolescents are important aspects of most questions and were considered as overarching criteria;
iii) Gender Equality and Empowerment of Women (GEEW) were considered in all questions as
appropriate; iv) Equity, including people living with disabilities, were considered in all questions as
appropriate; v) Human Rights were considered in all questions as appropriate; vi) The context relating
to implementation of the BBL programme and timeline of events occurring in Myanmar (Annex C) are
important considerations relating to most questions; vii) Variations in localities and groups of people are
important considerations for most questions; viii) Variations in approach of each implementing partner
owing to differing modalities of operation were considered for most questions.
35
2.5 Data Protection Protocol and Evaluation Ethics
Protecting personal data was essential for the BBL evaluation given the current status of conflict
throughout Myanmar. The Evaluation team maintained confidentiality of sources of data obtained during
primary data collection. In coordination with UNICEF, the evaluation team ensured that the evaluation
complied with local and national data protection and privacy laws83. Throughout, the evaluation, primary
and secondary data collected were recorded systematically within an evaluation assessment framework.
This comprehensive data source was used to validate and verify findings as they emerged against the
evaluation questions and indicators. The identity of informants for primary data collection were
anonymized in the data collection tools.
The evaluation team committed to the obligation not to publish or otherwise communicate to third parties,
through any medium whatsoever, any information on the participants in the evaluation consultations. In
their communication with all stakeholders, the evaluation team explained the commitments to
confidentiality and anonymity in a transparent way in order for stakeholders to understand the data
protection protocol and based on that, they decided whether to participate or not in the evaluation.
The Evaluation team strictly followed the UNEG ethical guidelines84 and the UNICEF Procedure for
Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation, Data Collection and Analysis throughout the evaluation
process. The evaluation team did ensure that the principles of integrity, independence and impartiality
and accuracy, completeness and reliability are respected. Hence, the Evaluation team prevented any
form of potential conflict of interest and ensured that the evaluation is conducted in a transparent and
accountable manner. The Evaluation process, including quality assurance procedures ensured that
evidence in the Evaluation could not be traced back to any individual informant. In specific terms, the
evaluators adhered to ethical principles for evaluations which included: i) Informed consent; ii)
Avoiding Harm; iii) Respectful Treatment of participants in accordance with culture, local customs,
religious beliefs and practices, personal interaction and gender roles, disability, age, and ethnicity; iv)
Voluntary participation; v) Ensuring confidentiality; Independence and impartiality of the
Evaluation team.
2.6 Limitations to the Evaluation
Limitations, risks and mitigation measures for the BBL evaluation were identified during the inception
phase, and were realised during the evaluation. Restriction on travel to some communities occurred
owing to security issues. As a result, respondents at 7 sites were interviewed online and site observation
was undertaken via webcam. The evaluation team was comprised of an international evaluator
supported by a national consultant and five enumerators. The international evaluator could not travel to
Myanmar owing to security restrictions and therefore coordinated the evaluation remotely. The small
composition of the team can result in bias. This was mitigated by several factors including: the
experience of the evaluation team; b) the quality assurance process; c) a process of triangulation; d) a
thorough review process overseen by an evaluation technical working group. Many of the evaluation
regions had distinct regional languages85 and it is likely that many of the documents were in the local
Myanmar language. To counter this the evaluation team was comprised of enumerators derived from
regions surveyed who usually spoke the local dialect/language and the national language, the lead
national consultant was fluent in English and Myanmar and google translate was used and manually
checked to translate documents and transcripts. Given that the BBL was undertaken during the twin
crisis affecting Myanmar, and data confidentiality is important, it was anticipated that granular data was
not likely to be available for analysis. Limitations were noted in the analysis of all data. All efforts were
be made to use proxy data to compensate and extrapolate for data gaps. All assumptions and exceptions
are noted when presenting analysis and drawing conclusions
83 In addition to the evaluation teams own research, the Evaluation team also relied on the advice of UNICEF to
ensure that all local and national data protection and privacy laws are respected.

3 Main Findings
3.1 Overview
This section presents findings based on each of the twenty nine (29) Evaluation Questions (EQ) in the
evaluation TOR. A summary of findings for each EQ is followed by a narrative referencing sub-questions
in the evaluation matrix.
As described above in the Methodology section, findings were drawn from various sources including
document review, KII, FGD, Site Observations and Case Studies with a wide range of stakeholders
engaged in the BBL. If significant contradictions were found between data sources during triangulation,
then these have been stated. Otherwise, it may be assumed that results were consistent between
different data sources.
3.2 Relevance
3.2.1 (Q1) To what extent have the objectives and implementation strategies of the
BBL programme been consistent with the requirements of the target groups and
country needs?
The objectives and implementation strategies of the BBL programme been highly consistent with
the requirements of the target groups and country needs. The BBL aligns with the needs identified
in the Political Economy Analysis (PEA)86, implementation modalities conform with United Nations
Country Team (UNCT) guidelines (2021). The BBL’s composite approach to community and home-
based learning for children aged 3-18 provides a synergistic effect to support engagement with key target
groups with a focus on disadvantaged children and regions/states. The Community Learning Resource
Centre model is designed to facilitate the main outcome and so testing and piloting the model
successfully will lead to more children engaging in community and home-based learning. The outreach
programme further extends the geographic reach of the learning hubs to target communities in need of
alternative education services.
The BBL is designed to address needs identified in the PEA and which are also reflected in the findings
of community research work undertaken by UNICEF in 202287, 88. Schools have been closed for almost
two years and so children’s learning has been severely affected. The BBL has been designed to address
the issues of exclusion, migration, trauma and lack of access to education and other services for children
3 to 18. The focus has been on enhancing existing community libraries or learning hubs through
support with technical and material resources to support children’s learning. This has enabled a
flexible approach towards re-engaging children of all ages in learning in communities which may lack
government schools, where parents are reluctant to send their children to government schools or where
government schools remain closed. It has also helped address the learning crisis by providing
opportunities for remedial and home-based learning.
The BBL has components which are designed to aid children affected by the twin crisis. These include
the EXCEL pathways component, counselling for children and families, and strategies employed to

Informant Interviews and Focus Group Discussions, UNICEF, Oct-Dec 2022
88 The top three barriers for accessing formal education spaces were schools/classrooms not reopening due to the
military takeover (45%), perceived insecurity in/around or on the way to/from schools (38%), and children being
overage (36%). The most common types of support needed to address the educational barriers are learning
materials (72%), school kits/ teaching supplies (71%), and student kits/ learning supplies (70%). Volunteer
teacher/educator incentive payment is also significant as many respondents (62%) mentioned this type of
support. Classroom equipment and training for educators are also needed by about half of the respondents.
Training for parents/community members, renovation/rehabilitation of education space, and education-related
cash and voucher assistance are needed by less than half of the respondents. Recreation kits and improved
WASH facilities in education space are needed by less than a third of the respondents.

engage CWD and ethnic minority children, Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) and
Protection from Sexual Exploitation, Abuse and Harassment (PSEAH). Elements of MHPSS and
child protection were integrated into education activities such as discouraging bullying and sexual
harassment. The ECCD, Open Learning and NFPE have been designed to address numeracy and
literacy across the target age groups and to re-engage children in learning who were Out of School
Children (OOSC). The concept of community learning hubs / libraries provide safe and consistent
spaces for children to attend and engage in education and other activities. Centre heads interviewed
believed the BBL was relevant to help address the crisis with almost all (36 of 38) respondents believing
children were receiving some form of education through the BBL89.
In many areas there was no alternative to education for children during the twin crisis90. In early June
2022 MOE schools opened in some areas under control of SAC91. In areas not in the control of SAC,
students often had no access to education and thus the BBL gave children a path towards education
and towards primary equivalency. In areas where schools are opening, many children had not attended
school for a period of up to two years. For those children BBL provided opportunities for home based
and remedial catchup learning. MoE schools are often under resourced and lack sufficient teachers and
so children still benefit from attending BBL classes on weekends92.
3.2.2 (Q2) Have the implementation strategies been flexible to meet the different
situations of communities based on location?
The implementation strategies have been flexible to meet the needs of different communities
based on location and within the general framework and resource constraints of the BBL. A main
mechanism was IP engagement with Community based Education Committees during the programme
orientation. This helped ensure the BBL was tailored to the needs of each community. Flexibility in
approach was evident. Examples include: variations in learning spaces to suit local conditions and
security; variations in learning pathways adopted by each community; variations in local implementation
modalities such as for refurbishment of facilities and recruitment of facilitators. There is scope for greater
flexibility such as greater discretion in allocation of financial resources at the community level, although
this would require greater monitoring to ensure accountability, effectiveness and quality are maintained.
One of the criteria upon which IP were selected was their connection with communities in disadvantaged
regions. IP engaged in dialogue with communities through Education Committees or their
equivalent which enabled communities to localize, manage and guide the programme in
accordance with local needs. A flexible approach to changing target townships was adopted based
on the evolving security situation and the preferences determined by each community93. Of the 198
townships participating in Phase I and II during 2022: 129 (87%) Townships participated in ECCD; 114
(77%) Townships participated in Open Learning; 39 (26%) townships participated in NFE.
Specific examples of flexibility were noted by respondents. Communities used different types of
centres for hosting and teaching children based on security, security risks and local preferences. In some
villages children had to be taught in smaller classes in facilities spread throughout the village owing to
security and conflict related issues. ‘Community-run education spaces were performing well in Magway
region, while formal schools were more prevalent and attended at higher rates in Kachin and Kayin/Bago
(East). Temporary learning spaces were highly opened and attended in Rakhine state and Shan (South),
89 Centre heads noted: i) That during the COVID and the political crisis, the BBL program has been successful in
helping children continue their education; ii) It has helped prepare children to return to education post twin crisis;
iii) It helped those who have left school to develop a desire to return to school; iv) It was especially helpful for
poor families; v) Children have become more knowledgeable and improved their communication with adults; vi)
It has improved the mood and wellbeing of children, especially those conflict affected; vii) It has improved
children's capacity to read and write, appreciate books and has resulted in an increased desire to read.

while church-based or other faith-based educational spaces were more prevalent and attended in
Rakhine and Kachin states. Tuition was highly opened and attended in Rakhine and Sagaing. Monastic
education spaces were opened more in Rakhine and Kayin/Bago (East) but attended at higher rates in
Kayah and Shan (South). Finally, ethnic education spaces were opened more in Kachin state, but
attended at higher rates in Kayah state’. These differences highlight the need for tailored approaches to
education based on regional and local contexts94.
Refurbishment of learning centres and procurement of some materials were undertaken locally.
Facilitators were recruited from local communities and were often selected based on fluency in the local
ethnic language(s) and books were adapted to local ethnic languages. The BBL also adopted a flexible
approach to data collection where personal security and data privacy were considerations. UNICEF
allowed separate budgeting for different areas based on security, access, transport and estimated local
unit costs/child95.
However, the Community Consultation (2022) determined that whilst 85% respondents believed activity
meets real needs, only 65% of them believed that it aligns with the community preferences96. The BBL
Evaluation determined that communities would like greater flexibility in the application of financial
resources locally such as scaling facilitator wages, transportation costs and options for local procurement
of materials.
3.2.3 (Q3) Have the objectives and implementation strategies of the BBL programme
been consistent with Joint Response Framework (JRF) priorities, as well as
partner and donor policies?
The objectives and implementation strategies of the BBL programme have been consistent with
JRF priorities, and with those of partner and donor policies. The BBL clearly outlines approaches
to education that are aligned with the Humanitarian Response Plan (2021)97 and with the Socio-
Economic Resilience and Response Plan (SERRP)98. It aligns with the approach defined in the Myanmar
Education Cluster Strategy (MECS) (2022-2025), the United Nations Country Team (UNCT)
guidelines (2021). IP were less clear on whether the BBL was aligned with their own internal policies
but noted it aligned with their areas of expertise or general organisational objectives and approach. IP
had adopted UNICEF policies and guidelines concerning data privacy and protection and child
protection.
Post military takeover, the JRF defines the framework under which partners are advised to engage with
government and specifies modalities for supporting the provision of essential services99,100, 101. The BBL
was already ongoing when the PEA was conducted and during the drafting of the JRF. UNICEF noted
that the BBL was informative towards the development of the JRF102. This is consistent with the finding

of the BBL Evaluation which note that the modalities of the BBL conform with those recommended
through the JRF.
The Joint Response Framework103 (JRF) has the objective of ensuring that children and youth in
Myanmar re-engage in quality, meaningful, inclusive and gender responsive learning in safe, protective
environments, with a particular focus on the most vulnerable learners such as children from
Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), migrant communities, and ethnic minority and girls and boys
with disabilities or developmental delays and adolescent girls. The BBL Programme has special
emphasis on those vulnerable children most likely to have been impacted by the crisis.
The Bringing Back Learning Programme aligns directly to the JRF strategic objective under basic
education, including early learning. It aligns to all three programmes including programme 1 on access,
programme 2 on quality and learning, and programme 3 on management. In terms of the sub-
programmes, the BBL aligns with sub programme 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4. Under programme 2 it aligns
with all five sub-programmes and under programme 3, it aligns especially to sub-programme 3.1, 3.2,
3.3 and 3.4 as per the draft JRF, version available as of 11 February 2022. It aligns with the MECS
(2022-2025) and UNCT.
IP were less clear on whether the BBL was aligned with their own internal policies. Most (8 of 9)
noted that the BBL aligned with their areas of expertise or general organisational objectives, such as
assisting communities to upgrade libraries and create learning opportunities for children104, or in the case
of KMSS it aligned with their own strategic plan (2019-2023)105.
3.2.4 (Q4) Were the project areas chosen include states that were severely impacted
by the conflict and crisis (thematic and geographical)?
Project areas were chosen to include states that were severely impacted by the conflict and crisis
both thematic and geographical. The selection of regions for Phase I was based on areas impacted
by conflict and by the COVID-19 crisis. The selection of regions for Phase II selected deprived regions
based on analysis of data, but data used was derived from 2017 to 2021 and would have altered
considerably following the military takeover. Specific project areas were also influenced by the capacity
of IP to operate in selected communities and regions. However, the extent of the twin crisis on
children throughout Myanmar was so extensive that areas and communities requiring BBL could
not be included owing to resource constraints.
The principals of selection of regions are detailed in section 1.5.6. Phase I geographical coverage was
Nationwide, with special focus on on most disadvantaged locations, such as areas that are affected by
protracted conflicts in Rakhine, Kachin and northern Shan, and areas that are severely being affected
by the COVID-19 crisis106. A key criterion was ensuring secure, accessible, and safe communities for
implementation107. Phase I coverage was also informed by the GPE COVID-19 Accelerated Funding
which targeted those regions most severely impacted by covid19.

Phase II was informed by a robust deprivation analysis based on available data for Severity Index108,
Poverty rates109, Urban Population110, Estimated Internally Displaced (IDP) Children111, and OOSC112
(refer Annex G). However, the extent of the twin crisis was so large, that given the relatively small funds
committed to BBL, almost any region throughout Myanmar would have been suitable for the BBL
interventions113, 114. Data on which the deprivation analysis was based would have changed significantly
during 2021/22 and so would have been only partially reliable.
Geographic coverage was also determined by where IP had existing operations or connections within
the community and that there were challenges in identifying CSOs to work with after the Military
Takeover115. Within each region, communities were selected based on the willingness of the community
to participate and in many cases was based on a pre-existing relationship of the IP with the community.
Examples included having a faith-based organisation such as a church within the community116, a local
office nearby117, or a working relationship with communities118.
Phase I had a staggered approach to implementation in which PD were signed and commenced as IP
were identified, assessed and indicated readiness. As a result, some regions had shorter
implementation timeframes dependent on the PD (refer figure 2). Phase II partners were selected during
the planning phase and so contracts were either renewed or commenced (in the case of Succor
Foundation) at the start of Phase II allowing for greater uniformity in approach to selected regions. Phase
II also had a narrower geographic coverage enabling more focus over a smaller number of regions.
3.3 Coherence
3.3.1 (Q5) How well does BBL complement and fit with the community level activities
to advocate home and community level learning among children?
The BBL complements and fits with community level activities to advocate home and community
level learning among children. Many communities do not have access to education services and so
the BBL provides an avenue for those children to receive an education. The BBL (anecdotally) promoted
positive behavioural for children which helped them engage with each other, parents and the community.
Many communities also contributed to the BBL through provision of materials, supplementing facilitator
wages, feeding children and other means. There is scope to further tailor the BBL to the needs of
communities through increased provision of vocational education relevant to local demands.
The design of the BBL project supports encourages home and community level learning through
development of community learning centres, the provision of home-based learning material, community
and parent education and trained facilitators.

Almost all (88%, 36 of 41) of centre heads/facilitators believed that the BBL complimented or fit
in with community activities to advocate home and community level learning among children and
gave children the opportunity to learn at home or the library and motivated them to do so. This aligned
with findings of the Community Consultation which noted that more than (four out of five) respondents
felt that the support provided by UNICEF and its partners met real needs, and more than half felt that
they were in line with community preferences119.
The BBL complemented community activities and goals. Facilitators engaged children in community
activities such as cleaning the village and library. In some centres classes were taught on the weekends
which enabled children who had to engage in school, work or home activities to attend BBL. Important
aspect of the BBL were those relating to MHPSS, PSEAH, WASH and EXCEL pathway which
respondents believed helped children socialise, empathise and engage with other children and adults,
and cope with stress and change resulting from the impact of the twin crisis. The inclusion of these
elements resulted in a positive impact on child behaviour, social engagement, health, hygiene, the desire
to learn and to perform community service. The Community Consultation report also reported that over
80% of respondents believed the EXCEL pathway met real needs and was in line with community
preferences, but satisfaction was only 36%120.
Community contributions to the BBL emphasised the importance of the BBL to communities.
Examples of community contributions included: i) providing additional facilitators and supplementing
facilitator income and allowances; ii) providing and refurbishing learning spaces; iii) providing food for
children and complementary materials; iv) providing complimentary funds towards operational expenses
of the libraries.
Many children either work in or seek employment in the vocational sector and that opportunities for
vocational education would help create economic and employment opportunities which are desperately
needed121. This could further align the BBL with community level goals and encourage learning.
Case Study 1
Chesa122 is 8 years old from Bago State. She is of Karen Ethnicity and has two siblings. Her mother is
suffering from a lung disease. Her family is poor and has suffered greatly since the military takeover and
Chesa had had not attended school since covid19 began. She tries to help her parents at home as best
she can but life is difficult for her family. Since commenced the BBL managed under KBC and begun
studying Grade 1. She believes the BBL has helped her significantly. It has helped her to understand
good hygiene and conduct, to engage with and play with her friends, to learn and appreciate homework,
time management and schooling. She has become popular with her friends and the library facilitators
and as a result has grown more confident. She intends to keep learning in school and at the library.
3.3.2 (Q6) Are there overlaps or inconsistencies between different programmes?
There was no overlap between programmes operated by different development partners or
between IP. Coordination mechanisms such as the Education Cluster Group and UNICEF planning
meetings helped ensure there was no overlap. However, there were opportunities to improve
coordination between different sectors at the regional/state level, to help ensure a wholistic approach
towards child development. There is also the potential to strengthen information sharing, communication
and coordination mechanisms among IPs operating different programmes funded by UNICEF.
Opportunities for potential future synergy were identified such as complementing the BBL with
child feeding programmes, pro poor support and basic literacy programmes.
BBL Data for 2022 indicates that there were 149 townships where BBL was active managed by nine (9)
IP, excluding MLRC which gave technical support to all NGOs. Of those there were 37 townships were

serviced by two (2) IP, 10 townships by three (3) IP and 1 township was serviced by four (4) IP123 .
However, respondents could not identify overlaps between the different programmes within
BBL124. In many villages IP noted that the BBL was the only provision of education available to
children125. Planning for Phase II helped reduce any overlap between IP coverage by coordinating
through a smaller number of IP and having a greater amount of time to prepare the programme.
There was no overlap identified between any other programmes operated by development
partners and the BBL. At the national level UNICEF coordinated using its systematic network and the
national Education Cluster Group as part of the modalities under the JRF to coordinate programming
with other development partners.
The main coordinating mechanisms within the BBL were: i) The Education Coordination Cluster Group
in which information was exchanged between IP and other NGO/CSO. ii) Discussions with the Education
Committee at the village level to ensure no overlap between IP126; iii) Regular BBL coordination meetings
between UNICEF and IP.
The limitation of these mechanisms is that they are focussed on the education sector. Addressing the
twin crisis requires coordination between multiple sectors including the Health, Nutrition and Child
Protection sectors. UNICEF is an active member of the newly established forum for coordination and
governance for the implementation of the JRF including the Education Sector Group (ESG), Education
Development Partners’ Group (EDPG) and Education Sector Representative Group (ESRG). It will be
important to ensure that these coordination mechanisms encompass programmes from other sectors to
help complement the BBL and provide synergy. It will also be important to ensure that such a
mechanism encompasses coordination at the sub-national level as many social programmes
may require strong coordination at the state/regional or township level.
Programmes with which it may be possible to synergise outcomes are listed below. For example,
lack of food and midday meals for children was identified as one of the main barriers towards children
attending learning centres. Coordinating with WFP to provide midday meals could ensure children have
access to appropriate nutrition and encourage greater engagement in learning.
Respondents identified examples of programmes, some of which are in non-education sectors,
where greater coordination may yield synergistic results. These included: i) Microfinancing through
the LIFT investment undertaken by BDA127; ii) Central Emergency Response Fund Cash Assistance to
Displaced and Conflict-affected Persons undertaken by World Food Programme128; iii) A basic literacy
programme supported by Plan international, Save the children and Relief international through MLRC in
selected regions/states129; iv) Vocational education undertaken by Plan International in selected
regions130; v) Packaged Girls Project for girls aged 16 to 20 to become community leaders undertaken
by Succor Foundation; vi) Child protection activities and health and livelihood training in all areas
managed under WVI; vii) ECCD in IDP camps in Northern Rakhine and Non Formal and Remedial
learning undertaken by Center For Social Integrity (CSI) under GPE COVID-19 Accelerated Funding;
viii) Non Formal and Remedial learning in 6 townships in Rakhine state undertaken by Community and
Family Services International (CFSI) funded by UNICEF; ix) Education in Emergencies (EiE) providing
education to IDP and displaced children.

3.4.1 (Q7) Was the budget defined adequately ex ante? Did the project budget make
adequate provisions for all important goals, e.g., addressing gender and
inclusion related specific objectives/activities?
Phase I targets were exceeded for most indicators. Phase I targets were exceeded for (C1) the
number of children accessing formal and non-formal education, including early learning (110%) but there
was variability between learning pathways with ECCD well exceeding the target (348%) but numbers of
children accessing Open Learning (74%) and NFE (38%) falling below the target. For Phase II, the
budget was defined adequately ex ante in terms of total beneficiaries reached which significantly
exceeded targets in all categories. In all an estimated total of 209,340 children (GPI 1.03) were
reached by the BBL Phase I and II131.
The outreach programme exceeded the target by 130% (229% of) demonstrating its cost
effectiveness in terms of reaching children. However, IP noted many areas where budget was
considered inadequate such as facilitator salaries. Most facilitators were unsure as to whether they had
sufficient training, materials, and resources to properly address GEDSI. HI noted the challenges in
properly addressing issues relating to CWD such as the demand and requirement for specialised
resources and teaching.
Phase I achievements against targets for the AWP 2022 is shown in Annex D. Phase I targets were
exceeded for (C1) the number of children accessing formal and non-formal education, including early
learning (110%). This was mainly attributed to ECD (348% of target). Open Learning was only (74%)
of the target and NFE (38%). Most other targets were exceeded with the exception of: (C2) Number of
children receiving individual learning materials (20%); (C4) Number of children with disabilities supported
to access learning, including remote/distance learning and return to school (35%); (C5) Number of
children received COVID-19 prevention materials.
For the Phase II UNICEF note the following progress as reported at April 2023132 at the point of 70%
expenditure (3.2M of 4.6M USD). The RFW for Phase II is presented in Annex E. For phase II, most
targets have been exceeded by a significant amount. The total number of children benefiting was
138.3% of the target. The main cause of exceeding the target was the outreach programme which
reached 229.8% of the targeted number of children, demonstrating the success of this
component. In all outputs gender was strongly biased towards girls, which indicates that there may be
a need to focus on ensuring an equal proportion of boys also benefit from the programme.
5 of 9 IP found the budget to be sufficient as defined ex ante133 but only 37% (15 of 41) of centre
heads/facilitators surveyed believed they had sufficient training, materials and support under the
BBL including helping to address GEDSI specific objectives and activities (61%, 25 of 41 were
unsure). UNICEF reported some areas where budget was insufficient to meet demand such as in the
case of provision of open learning materials. IP increased the number of children during implementation
and therefore additional books needed to be printed. UNICEF demonstrated flexibility in adapting budget
to meet needs.
The target for CWD included only children with hearing and visual impairment owing to resource
constraints but HI reported that the budget allocated to CWD was insufficient when compared to
the demand. It was difficult to predict required budgets for CWD because the full extent of CWD, and
specific needs of each child, were poorly understood at the commencement of the BBL. Severe
disabilities required specialized equipment, services or training which were expensive and not budgeted

for under the BBL. Other IP also noted the inadequacy of funding for CWD in Phase I and noted it was
improved for Phase II but still very limited134.
Funding issues included135: i) Facilitator salaries being inadequate as many facilitators were part of
the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) and had stopped working for MoE and were now voluntary
facilitators136; ii) Inflationary costs, bank charges and increased transport costs137; iii) Budget for
refurbishment was insufficient and many phase I centres lacked gendered toilet spaces138; iv) In some
cases partners wanted to do more and provided additional funding for activities such as refurbishment
of learning spaces (WVI); v) There was insufficient budget for ethnic language books but some partners
such as WVI undertook efforts to provide local books in ethnic languages using local or IP resources.
IP generally found the process of obtaining budget approval and renegotiating allocation of budget to be
easy provided budget was reallocated between existing budget lines and within the overall budget ceiling
of the PD.
3.4.2 (Q8) Were funds and activities delivered in a timely manner? If not, what were
the bottlenecks encountered? How do banking issues affect financial
disbursement?
Fund transfers to IP were problematic, especially during the first year of Phase I
implementation. The 3 month period allowed to declare liquidation of finances was too short as
activities often had to be delayed owing to conflict and other issues. Upon resumption of activities,
remitted funds had to be applied for again in a new tranche. Materials such as tablets, covid19 items
and open learning materials were centrally administered by UNICEF and delays of 2-6 months were
reported by IP.
Limitations on transfers were imposed by SAC and IP had to undertake processes to accommodate
limitations. The NGO administration law caused delays as all activities had to be reported to the
Junta. Some IP, such as KBC, MBC, WVI, BDA, were on 6 month to 18 month Programme Documents
(PD) and so delays impacted the capacity to coordinate activities.
Fund transfers from UNICEF to UNICEF field offices and then to IP encountered issues, especially
during the first year of Phase I implementation139. The banking system was challenging and only a
small amount could be withdrawn by IP at once. As a result, IP had to resort to using multiple different
banks and accounts to ensure adequate funds arrived140. Only 63% (26 of 41) of centre heads and
facilitators reported that supplies, funds and activities had been delivered in a timely manner. To
accommodate delays some IP had to borrow money from other programmes to ensure activities were
undertaken on time. Several IP (2) noted that between 2% and 3% of funds had to be allocated to an
agent to enable bank transfers which marginally reduced funds available for activities.
In the context of UNICEF’s process for declaring disbursement of funds, the 3 month period
allowed to declare liquidation of finances was too short as activities often had to be delayed
owing to conflict and other issues. Bureaucracy usually took one month leaving 2 months to
receive cash and implement. Funds not allocated had to be returned. Upon resumption returned
funds had to be requested again in a new tranche. If activities had to be suspended and then

resumed, the IP lacked the funds allocated and had to reapply. IP recommended allowing 6 or 7 months
to submit liquidation of funds which would allow for a greater period for activities.
During the BBL the government enacted the NGO administration law which forbids the provision
of aid to areas not controlled by the SAC and those who oppose the junta141. This meant IP had to
report their plans and the conduct of most activities to the SAC throughout the BBL. Most BBL activities
were in areas not controlled by SAC in which implementation was not allowed. This resulted in IP having
to be cautious when implementing activities, transporting goods or withdrawing funds. At one point the
Junta stopped allowing shipments and materials had to remain in storage which caused delays for IP.
Materials such as tablets, COVID-19 prevention items and open learning materials were centrally
administered by UNICEF and delays of 2-6 months were reported by IP owing to the confluence
of issues. Several IP, KBC, MBC, WVI, BDA, noted that the duration of their implementation was short
being only 6 to 18 months. Delays in funding and delays in materials and learning kits resulted in
problems coordinating activities which relied on those materials. IP recommended an emphasis on local
procurement where possible to avoid issues of transportation and resulting delays. Some IP noted they
could purchase learning kits more easily and quickly locally, however this could add to the burden of
monitoring in order to ensure accountability and quality.
It is also worth noting that the military takeover was not considered in preparedness planning142.
Therefore, the BBL was commenced under significant disruptions including the need to consider staff
safety, evacuation of international staff and the safety and capacity of each CSO to implement the
BBL143. GPE agreed to enable funding to be redirected towards BBL and UNICEF demonstrated
considerable adaption during this period and under significant constraints.
3.4.3 (Q9) How efficiently have resources (human resources, time, expertise,
supplies, transportation, funds etc.) been allocated and used to achieve the
projects objectives?
Resources (human resources, time, expertise, supplies, transportation, funds etc.) been
effectively allocated and used to achieve the projects objectives. For example, Open Learning
Material developed by Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) under the Curriculum Reform
at Primary Level of Basic Education (CREATE) programme were used under the BBL. There were areas
where efficiency was impacted by events largely beyond the BBL’s control. These included: increased
transportation costs and delays owing to the need to circumvent restrictions and conflict areas; online
training sometimes replacing F2F owing to COVID-19 and security issues; and administration costs
through many CSO but enabling reach to communities. There may be opportunities to reduce costs by
scaling some components of BBL such as NFE, and by forming Public Private Partnerships (PPP) to
expand vocational courses offerings144..
All IP interviewed believed resources had been allocated and used efficiently. As noted in section
4.4.3 (Q8) delays in delivery of materials combined with short project durations impacted the efficiency
as it meant materials such as open learning materials were not available for facilitators to use during
portions of the project. Transportation was inefficient and circuitous routes had to be used in many
areas. This raised transportation costs introduced further delays impacting scheduling.

Training had to be provided online for some recipients owing to security and COVID-19 restrictions.
Internet connectivity is very poor in some areas as indicated in surveyed centres (refer annex H)145.
Some of the training was up to 9 days and the quality was heavily impacted when delivered online.
There was evidence of efficiency being applied throughout the programme including: using printed Open
Learning Material developed by JICA/CREATE under the then MoE146; utilising existing learning spaces
in communities; repurposing 2,000 tablet and 200 laptopswhich were originally intended for government
schools under GPE COVID funding, for distribution to learning centres.
3.4.4 (Q10) Did the results achieved justify the costs?
The cost per child (unit cost) for Phase I were ECCD (36 USD), Open Learning (71 USD) and NFE
(149 USD). The average cost per child for Phase I was 71 USD per child compared to 56 USD per
child147. These figures compare favourably with comparative programmes undertaken in
Myanmar. The outreach programme reduced unit costs by enabling BBL activities to reach communities
located near target communities. The costs were justified as in many communities there were no
alternatives to education and where there were alternatives, schools were often understaffed, and
children required remedial learning due to the long period of school closure. The NFE component also
helped engage children who were OOSC and numbers of OOSC were reported to have increased
significantly during the twin crisis.
The table below show the unit cost calculations for Phase I and Phase II. Phase I data is disaggregated
by learning stream. Phase II data was only available for the total cost.
Table 3. Unit costs for Phase I and Phase II148 (Source: UNICEF MCO)
Phase Type ECCD Open Learning NFE Total
Phase 1 Cost (USD) 1,211,354 2,868,191 2,186,766 6,266,311
Phase I Number Children 33432 40,217 14706 88,355
Phase I Unit Cost $ 36.2 $ 71.3 $ 148.7 $ 70.9
Phase 2 Cost (USD) 3,292,098
Phase 2 Number Children 58,349
Phase 2 Unit Cost $ 56.4
The cost per child (unit cost) for Phase I were ECCD (36 USD), Open Learning (71 USD) and NFE
(149 USD). The average cost per child for Phase I was 71 USD per child compared to 56 USD per
child. Factors in cost reduction from phase I to II may have included: i) resolving many issues prevalent
during the first year of the BBL such as higher transport costs; ii) Implementing the outreach programme
in Phase II; iii) reducing the number of IP in Phase II thus potentially reducing the administrative
overheads and IP training costs.
145 In three regions there was no internet connectivity available to any centres surveyed being Tanintharyi, Sagaing,
Chin and very few centres had good internet connectivity.
146 These included short-term home-based learning materials for primary school children, based on the national
curriculum, to review their learning from the previous school year (2019-2020); 500,000 copies were printed by
UNICEF through various resources, including GPE COVID response funds
147 Costs were determined by dividing the total amount allocated to a phase or learning stream by the total number
of children benefiting under that phase or learning stream. For phase II budget was not available disaggregated
by learning stream. Therefore phase II unit costs do not reflect the costs for each individual learning stream
which are likely to reflect Phase I costs.
148 Number of children was taken from BBL 2022 enrolment data which was assumed to be total unique children
enrolled.
47
Comparative costs are difficult to determine given the unique circumstances and approach. Some broad
comparisons include: i) NFPE was calculated at $110 USD per learner per year (2018)149; ii) The Non-
Formal Middle School Education Programme (NFME) was estimated at $433USD per year and included
vocational and ICT training (2018)150; iii) The MoE DBE reported that a child in basic education costs
approximately $100 USD per learner per year (2019)151. There are significant variations between the
different modes of delivery the most notable being the BBL outreach programme.
As indicated in section 4.4.1 (Q7) the target numbers in almost all output areas for Phase II have been
exceeded indicating that funds were allocated effectively to achieve the objectives. Response to
Q15152 and Q16153 indicate that children are engaging in learning and the BBL’s objectives are being
achieved. These findings give further evidence towards cost justification.
IP expressed satisfaction with the BBL and believed the results justified the costs154. In many
villages refurbishment of centres had resulted in a permanent safe space for children to learn with other
ancillary benefits to the community. Orientation developed parents’ capacity to encourage and facilitate
their children’s learning155. However, some areas did not receive all types of education offered under
the BBL being EDDD, Open Learning and NFE. Therefore there were children of age-appropriate groups
who could not be reached in all areas (refer Q2156). Whilst this demonstrated flexibility it also emphasised
that demand likely exceeded capacity, which was also emphasised by all IP.
3.4.5 (Q11) Could the same results have been attained with fewer resources?
There was no evidence that the BBL could have achieved the same results with fewer resources.
The constraints of the twin crisis introduced significant uncertainties and insecurities. Therefore, a
flexible approach had to be adapted both in developing new PD and in implementation of existing PD.
Phase I realigned existing PD contracts to ensure IP delivered education services directly to villages,
while adding additional PD contracts as IP were identified and in accordance with their varying capacities.
Phase II was designed with lessons from Phase I incorporated and adding the outreach programme.
Given the nature of the twin crisis, inefficiencies were inevitable and were acceptable within the context
of the limitations imposed by the crisis.
UNICEF had monitored and assessed Phase I and identified areas where efficiency gains could
be made and apply lessons from Phase I into Phase II. The main area where efficiency was
enhanced was through the outreach programme which increased the geographic coverage of learning
hubs to encompass nearby communities and decreased the unit cost per child. Phase II also enabled
the BBL to undertake a more structured, cohesive and comprehensive approach to the BBL utilising a

single funding source and organising IP under a single approach with an improved approach to
monitoring and goals of sustainability.
There is significant evidence that increased resources would have achieved greater results.
There are many underserviced villages which could not participate in the BBL owing to resource
constraints157. CWD could only be partially addressed owing to resource constraints and that the
demand for open learning materials was far higher than supply158. Other enhancements requested by
respondents included: i) midday feeding at libraries; ii) more types of vocational education; iii) Greater
parental orientation and opportunities to learn with children; iv) Increased number of facilitators; v)
Internet connectivity; vi) more books and resource materials; vii) greater emphasis on other subjects
such as science and ICT; viii) financial support for poor children.
3.4.6 (Q12) To what extent do the output and outcomes offset the cost of the chosen
inputs?
The BBL is a cost-effective means of delivering education services to disadvantaged
communities and in many communities provides the only means of educating children (Q10 cost
per child 56 USD). In others it provides means to engage children in ECCD, provide remedial and
catchup learning to children affected by the twin crisis, and re-engage OOSC in NFE. Research indicates
that the cost of not providing education is high and perpetuates a cycle of generational poverty leading
to low GDP growth and other socio-economic issues. Whilst a full cost benefits analysis is challenging,
the research suggests that the cost of not enacting programmes such as the BBL will be much higher to
Myanmar in the long run.
Studies globally attest to the high cost to society for failing to educate children159, 160. There is a
close connection between illiteracy and poverty and the countries with the lowest levels of literacy are
also the poorest economically. Poverty breeds illiteracy by forcing children to drop out of school to work,
and illiterate people are often stay on the lowest levels of the work force and thus remain in poverty.
Thus, illiteracy in turn reinforces poverty, and poverty is cyclical in families. Women and girls are
especially vulnerable to the cycle161. The cost of not educating children is likely to be significantly higher
in the longer term resulting in lost economic growth, higher crime rates and perpetuate a cycle of poverty.
The cost To GDP as a result of the economic cost of out-of-school children in South-East Asian countries
is high162. Studies also identify the benefits of ECE such as reductions in placement in special
education163. When taken together these findings emphasis the vital importance of engaging and
re-engaging children throughout Myanmar in education both during and after the twin crisis.
The beneficial aspects of the project can be summarised from the anecdotal evidence obtained during
the BBL Evaluation. In communities lacking schools, there was no viable alternative to BBL for school
age children. In communities having schools, school closures have resulted in many children not having

access to learning for long periods of time. For those children, the BBL offers opportunities for remedial
and catchup learning. Many communities lack ECCD and the BBL offers opportunities for children to
receive ECCD. The twin crisis has increased the number of OOSC and the BBL’s NFE component offers
opportunities to re-engage OOSC in learning. The EXCEL pathways, MPHSS and WASH components
were reported to have had an impact on child physical and emotional wellbeing. The cost effectiveness
of delivering education services via community learning hubs is comparable with other methods. The
enhanced geographic reach via the outreach programme enables children in remote satellite
communities to benefit from the BBL.
3.4.7 (Q13) How have beneficiaries and target groups been involved in decision
making during implementation, and how has feedback been gathered?
Beneficiaries and target groups have been involved in decision making at the start of
implementation and during implementation. The BBL Phase I and II were designed in
consultation with IP and communities. Mechanisms of feedback included: i) Beneficiaries and target
groups have been involved in decision making at the start of implementation and during implementation;
ii) Initial Feedback through community Focal Points/Committees; iii) UNICEF direct feedback
mechanisms such as via email; iv) IP consultation and community level consultation; v) UNICEF
qualitative Reviews included feedback from IP (December 2022) and Key Informant Interviews and
Focus Group Discussions held with target beneficiaries (Oct-Dec 2022). There is scope standardise
feedback from beneficiaries and to use innovative methods such as secure Real Time Monitoring (RTM)
approaches to improving the capacity to obtain and use feedback.
The modalities for engagement with target groups was defined for Phase I in the GPE Proposal for
Funding164 and evolved with the advent of the military takeover in 2021 and further with the proposal for
phase II funding under DFAT165. These are in alignment with UNICEF’s Guidelines to Integrating
Accountability to Affected People (AAP) which aim to ‘ensure that affected children and families
participate in the decisions that affect their lives, are properly informed and consulted, and have
their views acted upon’166.
The BBL Evaluation confirmed the following methods were effective in engaging target groups and
ensuring feedback was considered.
Initial Feedback through community Focal Points/Committees: Each community formed or already
had an Education Committee, Library Management Committee, Church Committee or equivalent, which
included representation from relevant individuals or groups within the community. The composition of
the committee varied (refer Q20). IP reported that the Education Committee was consulted at the start
of the programme during which each aspect of the BBL was considered. IP selected implementation
sites based on the responses to initial consultation. The level of consultation and final decision making
do not appear to have been standardised during Phase I but were left to the discretion of each IP.
UNICEF direct feedback mechanisms: UNICEF established mechanisms to enable feedback from
communities. These were implemented gradually throughout Phase I and were fully active for Phase II
and included: i) Feedback collected from communities through meetings, a hotline and emails which
includes an anonymous complaints and feedback contact point; ii) IP consulted with communities on a
regular (monthly) basis throughout the BBL and feedback was discussed with UNICEF through Regular
Monthly meetings; iii) IP produced monthly reports although the reports were not standardised and varied
in quality; iv) Quarterly reporting of risk incidences by IP to UNICEF.

UNICEF qualitative Reviews: There were also several qualitative reviews to help obtain feedback from
beneficiaries. These included: i) Feedback from Implementing Partners under current DFAT BBL
Program (December 2022)167; ii) A comprehensive community consultation process conducted (Oct –
Dec 2022)168; iii) The BBL Evaluation 169.
IP consultation and community level consultation: IP also consulted on a regular basis with
facilitators and the township education focal point. During the first year of phase I implementation the
extent to which each IP liaised with the community focal point was not consistent between IP. Some IP
consulted monthly, but others reported only undertaking consultation at the start and end of the
implementation. In Phase II IP were consistent in conducting monthly meetings with community
representatives through IP project coordinators at which progress, risks and the needs of each
community were discussed. All facilitators undertook regular consultation with parents, community
members and children and consolidated feedback to IP during monthly monitoring visits.
Engagement in some locations was hampered by both lack of access owing to the COVID-19 crisis and
military takeover. In some instances, it was not safe for IP or UNICEF field staff to travel to some areas
and some facilitators and community members indicated reluctance to communicate during FGD.
The findings from feedback were incorporated into the BBL programme, most notably into the approach
used to implement the BBL in each community, the design of Phase II of the BBL and into a future
programme called Quality Basic Education Pathways for Children in Myanmar (QBEP4C) due to
commence May 2023170.
However, there are significant gaps identified in the community consultation171 in which 29% of the key
stakeholders at the community level, being facilitators and village leaders, were not aware of the BBL
project activities. Only 58% of respondents had access to a feedback mechanism for providing
suggestions regarding UNICEF and partners’ activities for education support.
Mechanisms for reviewing, incorporating and communicating beneficiary feedback could be
improved for speed and accuracy. Some data was collected via Viber including baseline data and
security was reported to have been a main issue. The use of secure electronic communication tools such
as Telex, WhatsApp or Real Time Monitoring (RTM) software would enable rapid feedback to be
obtained, consolidated, and easily analysed allowing for more rapid and targeted response. There is
also scope to standardise community engagement and feedback mechanisms amongst all IP. There is
some evidence that this is occurring for Phase II. Assigning a Parent Teacher Association (PTA) for
each library centre would also help ensure representation and feedback from parents and students172.

172 The Community Consultation report (UNIEF 2022) noted that community facilitator/teachers and community
leaders are the most preferred channels of information, followed by faith leaders. However, there are also
several additional preferred information channels, including SMS, posters/pamphlets/banners, and social
media. Respondents in IDP camps show a higher preference for SMS compared to those in villages.

3.4.8 (Q14) What is the level of involvement of the Community, parents/caregivers,
community workers, natural community leaders, local organizations, Facilitators,
community structures, and other stakeholders in the programme to support
immediate provision of learning to children and strengthening community
resilience for sustaining education services in crisis situation.
The level of involvement of the key stakeholders within the community was high. The Education
Committee located in each community was the group responsible for approval of BBL activities and
modalities and had broad representation from the community. Capacity development was given to the
Education Committee to facilitate local management of the BBL. Efforts were made to encourage
Parents to participate in their child’s education via the activity of supporting parents to better aid their
children’s education. In Phase I, Parent Teacher Associations (PTA) were established in some but not
all communities but were included fully in Phase II implementation.
The BBL was a community driven programme involving consultation with the community
representatives, usually through the Education Committee or equivalent, occurred at the
commencement of the project and throughout173. The Education Committee guided the project and
made critical decisions including: i) the location of the learning centre/library; ii) selection of facilitators;
iii) coordinating community support for library centres such as refurbishment and provision of utilities.
The Education Committee included broad representation in many locations including the village leader,
woman’s groups, the township education officer, organization of persons with disabilities (OPD), parents
and facilitators. The Education Management Committee received a handbook through the BBL and were
involved in monitoring and feedback sessions with the parents and facilitators174.
All (41 of 41) centre heads/facilitators participating in FGD noted the involvement of the community,
community leaders and in some cases local organisations in the operation of the learning centre/library.
Involvement sometimes included other members of the community such as Governors, religious leaders,
church groups, community leaders, neighbours, parents, librarians, volunteers from the community, and
students. Some centres had a PTA to help engage parents and facilitators. In some cases, OPD were
involved, notably in centres located in IDP camps175.
Efforts were made to encourage Parents to participate in their child’s education via the activity of
supporting parents to better aid their children’s education. As noted, this helped encouraged parents to
send their children to centres and read at home. PTA were established in some but not all communities
but were included fully in Phase II implementation and these helped facilitate engagement of parents.
3.4.9 (Q15) To what extent has the project contributed to reengagement of children to
learning at community level?
The BBL has contributed to reengagement of children to learning at community level. Most
respondents believed the BBL had helped bridge the gap in learning during closure, particularly for
reading and comprehension and that the BBL had reengaged children in learning. Analysed data
demonstrating learning outcomes was not available for the evaluation. Some IP had engaged in
assessing learning outcomes and IP participating in Phase II were undertaking assessment of students
for placement in Steps176. Formative assessment was undertaken in the learning pathways of Open
Learning and NFE. Ensuring application of a standardised method to track learning improvements will
be essential for future programmes, particularly for children studying NFE.
Almost all (93%, 38 of 41) centre heads/facilitators who took part in the FGD believed that the BBL had
contributed to reengagement of children to learning at community level. Most (70%, 29 of 41) of centre

heads/facilitators believed that BBL helped bridge the gap in learning during closure of school,
particularly for reading and comprehension. 73% (30 of 41) of respondents believed the BBL had
influenced learning positively. They believed the BBL assisted children with remedial and catchup school
lessons and encouraged OOSC to resume education and noted that in refugee villages and many remote
villages children have no alternatives for education.
Baseline assessment of reading or other competency were not conducted on any of the BBL
programmes for Phase I. WVI had undertaken reading assessment for children taking open learning.
IP in Phase II had conducted learning assessment for children receiving Open learning in order to place
them into a Step but these are baseline and placement studies so no evidence yet exists to measure
gains made through the BBL. The NFE component also had formative and summative assessment for
students, but results were not available for the BBL Evaluation . UNICEF noted that measuring learning
assessment was not a priority in the context of the emerging twin crisis affecting Myanmar177. UNICEF,
as part of Phase II implementation, had assisted KBC SM, KMSS, Succor Foundation to assign children
to a Step178. UNICEF noted that the priority was to re-engage children to some form of learning, ensuring
continuity and so access was the focus. UNICEF also stressed the BBL had to operate within the
sensitivities of not establishing a parallel assessment system.
WVI had undertaken a qualitative survey of children’s changing attitudes and capacity179 and also
reported having undertaken pre and post learning assessment for children in ECCD and reading clubs180.
The survey indicated positive changes in attitudes and behaviour for both parents and children.
Record keeping at learning centres was not standardised or comprehensive. Only 22% (9 of 41)
of centre heads stated they had recorded and submitted data to the implementation partner concerning
enrolment, attendance and learning outcomes. There was a lack of uniformity in the description of how
this was undertaken specific to each IP concerned. For example, for centres under KBC there was a
standardised electronic process of recording and verifying data. Some centres maintained records of
enrolment, attendance, and learning results which were submitted to the IP on a monthly basis181.
Others took a structured approach to learning in which progress of each student was recorded with
suggestions on methods to improve learning specific to each child. For example, BDA noted that they
‘can see learning outcomes in the workbooks of the children and through community facilitators’.
Assessing learning outcomes at baseline and throughout will be essential for future
programmes, particularly for children studying NFE.
Attributes of the BBL which helped encourage children to re-engage in education included: EXCEL
pathways leading to positive behavioural changes; Engaging activities using games and storytelling;
capacity for home learning; capacity to bridge learning to enable children to re-enter the formal school
system182.
It will be important to develop methods of measuring learning outcome, social and behavioural
development to help qualify and quantify the extent to which the BBL is helping children to re-engage in
learning.

3.5 Effectiveness and Impact
3.5.1 (Q16/Q17) How well has the BBL initiative addressed the learning crisis coming
after COVID-19 and the military takeover period? What are the major factors that
have led to achievement or non-achievement of the project’s objectives? Which
of these factors are related to the TOC, including the risks and assumptions
associated with it, and which to the implementation of the project (such as
procurement and co-financing)?
The BBL is likely to have had a high impact towards addressing the learning crisis in
communities in which it has been implemented and those reached through the outreach
programme. Phase I was designed to address access challenges within the context of the twin crisis.
Phase II was also designed to enable access but also to assess learning improvement and therefore
incorporates learning assessment within the design. It is difficult to assess whether the BBL has
addressed the learning crisis in the absence of learning assessment data. However, the BBL has been
successful in re-engaging children in learning at the community level. Anecdotal evidence and limited
assessment data undertaken by some IP indicate that the BBL is helping address the learning crisis.
The impact on the overall crisis may have been limited owing to the magnitude of the crisis. Its estimated
that at least 209,340184 of 1,400,000 crisis affected children were reached by the BBL, being 14.9% of
the total but with a focus on disadvantaged and conflict regions.
The BBL’s impact on the overall crisis is likely to have been small, however the BBL does
demonstrate a cost-effective method of engaging children in learning during a crisis and in
remedial and catchup learning after a crisis. The number of children reached is likely only a small
proportion of the total number of children requiring assistance. Of the 12.5 million children estimated to
have been impacted by the twin crisis, 1.4m are considered ‘crisis-affected children’. The BBL reached
209,340 (GPI 1.03) crisis affected children during the 2022 year185. This is a significant achievement
representing 14.9% of the total number of children affected by the crisis. It is not clear the extent to
which the BBL is being adopted in non-target villages.
The TOC is shown and described in section 1.5.3. The main factors which have led to its achievements
or were identified as challenges are listed in the table below including how they relate to the TOC or

Not shown in the TOC but also likely to be significant risks are: Climate & disaster vulnerability,
including epidemics and pandemics that disrupt the development paths. An example is the recent
Cyclone storm Mocha.
The BBL TOC does not detail assumptions and inputs. External assumptions can be decisive for
the programme performance if not realized. The external assumptions present a given critical context
that needs to be fulfilled for the programme to take place as planned. The key external assumptions for
the BBL logic may be determined based on the programme modalities and funding and are: i) Continued
55
partner commitment towards funding programmes within Myanmar; ii) Continued ability to be able to
operate within the regions selected; iii) CSO support towards improving children and adolescents’ rights
to education and protection; iv) Stable and timely funding for BBL activities in general; v) Political status
quo ensuring the current situation continues.
There are also causal assumptions, which present the underlying logic of the generation of the changes
in the TOC. If these assumptions are not realized, this will have an impact on the BBL performance but
contrary to external assumptions causal assumptions can be changed by the programme management,
for instance, based on the result of monitoring and evaluations. The key causal assumptions include
selected barriers and risks: i) Implementation through thematic sector and multi-sector programming and
supported by cross-sectoral expertise will allow an integrated holistic approach that will generate overall
changes (WASH/Education/peacebuilding); ii) Social behaviour, particularly that of parents, can be
changed through evidence generation advocacy and training; iii) Community hubs can be changed to
accommodate, enable, and support child rights and protection; iv) Multi-stakeholder partnering with
communities, parents, academia and others including children and adolescents will increase BBL
performance; iii) Economic hardship such as child labour can be overcome through financial support,
advocacy and support; iv) An adequate number of qualified facilitators can be identified, motivated and
retained with support; v) the provision of adequate teaching and learning materials.
3.5.2 (Q18) Have the programme strategy and programme management been
steering towards impact and set up in a way to allow achievement of expected
outcomes and impacts?
The BBL strategy and programme management have been steering towards impact and set up in
a way to allow achievement of expected outcomes and impacts. Phase I was defined by emergency
response and measuring outcome was not a priority. However, the causal relationships between
activities, outputs and outcomes is logical and the strategy has been effective. Phase II has a more
clearly defined strategy towards measuring outcomes and towards ensuring sustainability, however there
is a need to define the strategy more clearly for monitoring BBL outcomes (refer Q19).
The strategy and programme management are described in: i) Proposal for Bringing back Learning to
Children in Myanmar187 relating to Phase I; ii) UNICEF Proposal to DFAT Bringing Back Learning to the
Children of Myanmar188. There are some variations between the strategy employed in Phase I and in
Phase II. Phase I was an emergency response (L2) to the twin crisis and reflects the need to move
quickly and flexibly to ensure provision of education services to children in crisis affected regions. Phase
II was designed with consideration of the lessons learned during Phase I and was initiated 17 months
after the military takeover. Phase II placed a greater emphasis on sustainability and measuring outcomes
such as learning outcomes with design provisions for both. These include developing a strategy for
assessing learning outcomes and working with communities to develop a sustainability strategy for each
learning centre, hub and community. Phase II also includes the outreach programme which has been
effective in engaging more children in the BBL in remote communities, many of which do not have
alternative means of education.
A main objective of the BBL’s is to pilot and test a replicable Community Learning Resource Centre
(CLRC) model. The BBL Evaluation survey of sites indicated that Community Learning Resource
Centres had been successfully strengthened in sites observed, but to properly assess the impact in this
regard it will be necessary to clearly define what is meant by sustainable and ‘replicable’.
The overall design of the programme and the causal path between activities, outputs and outcomes has
ensured that the BBL maintained a focus on impacts during the implementation process. These are
articulated in the TOC but there is variation between the TOC and the project proposals for Phase I and

II, most notably the revised target age group from 5 to 15 to 3 to 18 with the inclusion of ECCD and NFE
to age 18.
3.5.3 (Q19) Was focus on impacts given during the implementation process?
The BBL design limitations included: i) not developing a parallel assessment system; ii) not having
scheduled activities similar to classroom; iii) supporting continuity of education at the community or
home; v) community facilitator capacity, parent education and capability. As the BBL moves away from
Emergency response and towards longer term sustained capacity development, there is a need to
strengthen the strategy to accommodate the monitoring and evaluation of outcomes to help understand
the long term benefits to individuals and the communities and to understand the adoption, sustainability
and replicability of the CLRC model. The objectives of assessing the outcomes, impact and sustainability
are included in the design of the next phase under the QBEP4C programme.
The design of the programme and the causal path between activities, outputs and outcomes has ensured
that the BBL maintained a focus on impacts during the implementation process. As noted under Q18, a
strategy for measuring impact is being developed under Phase II and Phase II is placing greater
emphasis on sustainability which should help ensure the model can be successfully replicated.
There is an assessment system embedded into the NFE, EXCEL pathways, and Open Learning
Materials. It will be important to develop methods of measuring summative assessment outcomes so as
to understand the long term impact of the BBL. The monitoring framework and strategy for Phase II is
currently output based data concerning numbers of pupils, facilitators, materials and centres reached or
distributed through the BBL. It will be important to understand outcomes in qualitative and quantitative
means to understand the likely impact of the programme beyond anecdotal evidence. Suggestions for
measuring outcomes are included in the recommendations to this report.
3.5.4 (Q20) What are the key takeaways from the implemented strategies and
processes
The key takeaways from the implemented strategies and processes are:
I. Community library and outreach programme establish ownership and accountability of
community structure.
II. In situations where direct engagement with government may be restricted, working directly
through CSO can be an effective means of delivering education services to communities.
III. Working through CSO who have established relationships in target regions and who align with
and understand ethnic groups in each region can help mitigate risks such as security, remote
access and intransient local officials.
IV. Community engagement and ownership, such as through the Education Committee’s and
PTA, from the start of the implementation is critical to ensuring participation and ownership.
V. Community learning centers are appropriate vehicles to help deliver catchup education,
remedial education and other forms of education such as ECCD and NFE. They can provide
limited education services in environments where access to formal education may be limited.
VI. Provision of education materials such as open learning materials supported by trained
facilitators can help engage and re-engage children in learning.
VII. In challenging and deprived environments it is necessary to ensure a wholistic approach
towards development (the development nexus) including MPHSS, Child Protection, WASH,
Nutrition and peace building.
VIII. Parental education and sensitization are essential towards ensuring and encouraging
children’s ongoing and sustained engagement with education and in particular for parents of
vulnerable children such as CWD.
IX. Allowing flexibility towards budgeting and adjusting budgets for PD is necessary under crisis
situations.

3.6 Sustainability
3.6.1 (Q21) Has a realistic and effective exit strategy been developed and applied?
A realistic and effective exit strategy has not been developed for the BBL but is included in the
Phase II strategy as an objective189. IP had a lack of uniform approach towards exit planning.
Sustainability is emphasized under the new phase of the BBL termed Quality Basic Education Pathways
for Children in Myanmar190 (QBEP4C). Each centre will have a community management
committee/parent committee which is expected to play a role in the governance of community learning
and wellbeing centres and the development and implementation of plans for sustainability of the learning
centres. This would be a good vehicle to ensure each community generate an exit plan with a
sustainability plan. It will be important to define what an exit strategy means and how it relates to
sustainability. This may entail defining a costed model for sustainability which can be used to guide
communities and help them decide which aspects are to be sustained. Continued efforts to link
communities with donors and CSOs should be made to help facilitate sustainability post BBL. It should
also be noted that not all elements of the BBL are intended to be sustained. One purpose of BBL was
to provide supplementary support as children return to formal school. Therefore, once children do return
to school some elements of the BBL can be discontinued or reduced.
The BBL is designed to decentralise and localise education to the community level using local
actors and local partners and build longer term resilience that reduces dependence on
humanitarian assistance191. At the completion of the BBL it is intended that the libraries and hubs will
continue to provide supplementary education for children192. Sustained elements should include: i)
upgraded community libraries and hubs; ii) availability of Open learning materials; iii) Strengthened
capacity of educators to support supplementary education in the longer term; iv) Strengthened
coordination between local actors, NGO/CSO and donors. These must work in synergy with
humanitarian and peace initiatives.
Very limited exit planning was implemented under Phase I within the context of emergency
response. For example, when tablets and laptops were procured and distributed, selection of partners
to provide supplies included a requirement that they are able to maintain their use. Support through BBL
Phase 1 was extended to key partners and areas in BBL Phase 2. Data has not been collected on which
centres are still active following completion of Phase I contracts193. The Phase II BBL proposal states
the intention of building sustainable community learning centres and hubs.
Responses from IP concerning sustainability indicated a lack of uniform approach towards exit
planning. KBC, KMSS, BDA reported having no exit strategies, noting it was not in the programme
plan, and believed there would be serious issues towards sustainability. KBC SM have an exit plan
which includes continuing to work with some communities through church groups and community
support, noting that sustainability will be partly dependent on the willingness of the local church to sustain
the BBL194. The strategy also includes having a resource person at the district level to train new
facilitators as required. MBC stated they were working with communities to draft sustainability plans and
will try to find resources to assist those with plans by liaising with funding agencies. Succor Foundation

191 Localisation is achieved by working with local CSO and communities to strengthen their capacity to deliver and
sustain education for the most marginalised children.
192 The BBL was designed to not create a parallel education system, but rather addresses the immediate educational
needs facing children. This approach is articulated as a short- to medium-term approach that seeks to get
children back to learning as soon as possible.
193 For example BDA

noted that the exit strategy is important and are encouraging communities to think towards sustainability
beyond the BBL.
It will be important to define what an exit strategy means and how it relates to sustainability. This
will likely entail defining a costed model for sustainability which can be used to guide
communities and help them decide which aspects are to be sustained. Each community should
generate an exit plan with a sustainability plan. Efforts towards sustainability need to be combined
with peace building and a gradual move back to government delivered education support.
UNICEF’s coordination through the Education Cluster and ESWG, and other coordination mechanisms,
will help ensure alignment across the nexus.
The learning centres must be alive and fresh. Through community training and support we aim to help
communities to support themselves such as by buying new books, volunteering in the library, advocating
for more support from the community. These are all part of the community training strategy. Once we
see they can stand up on their own feet we are ok195.
3.6.2 (Q22) What evidence exists to suggest that the benefits of the project will be
sustained or institutionalized and scaled in the future? Please base the analysis
of this based on evidence around the financial, institutional, environmental,
technical, and social sustainability
The benefits of the project will likely be sustained or institutionalized and scaled in the future bt
the evidence is moderate and lacks a strong empirical basis, most of the evidence is anecdotal. The
community libraries existed before the BBL and will likely continue but questions remain over the
sustainability of enhancements delivered under the BBL and the capacity to continue operating classes.
Most centre heads and facilitators believed the BBL would be sustained in communities citing reasons
why.
There are scalable elements to the BBL which will be used during the new (phase III) of the BBL termed
Quality Basic Education Pathways for Children in Myanma (QBEP4C)196. Phase III intends to scale up
the BBL in 11 regions. MLRC, HI and UNICEF have developed a framework of materials and support
which would enable scaling and facilitate sustainability such as self-learning materials available
on their webpages. Some IP such as Succor Foundation reported that they had capacity to scale up
the BBL as they already had the right people in place with capacity developed.
Challenges towards sustainability are mainly financial, exacerbated in regions of conflict, and
include capacity to fund facilitators, materials and operational expenses after the conclusion of
the BBL. Sustainability may be improved if aspects of library centres can be coordinated with SAC
policies and legislation such as the operationalising the ECCD law (2014), which proposes government
financing for ECE. Scalability could also be enhanced through adopting flexible models of implementing
learning centres For example, basic elements of the library centre could be commenced in a community
and gradually upgraded as commitment and capacity develop.
90% (37 of 41) of centre heads and facilitators participating in KII believed the BBL would be
sustainable with the remainder believing it either would not be (3) or would be partly sustainable.
74% (52 of 70) of facilitators participating FGD believed the BBL can be fully sustained and continued
using local community contributions. Factors which contributed towards sustainability included: i) having
a sufficient supply of books; ii) Facilitators being locally based and connected with each other; iii)
facilitators being able to work part time; iv) Budget provision from the community and affiliated
organisations such as religious communities; v) Reducing the frequency of classes such as holding
classes once every two weeks.
Sustainability meant different things to different respondents. Some believed sustainability meant
sustained learning and behaviour changes for the participants, and others viewing it as the ability to

59
continue to deliver education services through centres after the conclusion of the BBL funding. None
reported having a sustainability plan. All centre heads and facilitators surveyed believed they
had gained knowledge and skills from the BBL which they would retain after programme
completion.
Some IP had orientated Education Committees towards consideration of sustainability but noted
that it was challenging for many communities owing to financial constraints, especially in conflict
areas. Challenges towards sustainability were financial with the main concern being the capacity to
continue to fund trained facilitators and replenish pedagogical materials and books. IP believed that
continuity in many regions may depend on the capacity to find volunteers or those willing to work for low
renumeration197. There were difficulties in raising funds from parents, especially poor families, and the
community. IP also reported that some centres may not continue because of conflict between SAC and
local actors.
The BBL is a supplementary programme and is specifically designed not to duplicate or create a parallel
system to the formal education system. However, lack of formal accreditation is a challenge. UNICEF
noted that the community and parents would prefer accreditation where possible. Sustainability of the
ECCD component will be enhanced if the government persists with the ECCD registration law which
calls for government funding for ECCD198.
‘Currently, there are more than 4,000 books, and we have resources in our hands so we can continue
the BBL after funding is concluded.199’. ‘When the project is finished, our children believe that they will
be able to go to school because of the courses we’ve taught. The teaching methods provided by this
project will remain, and I think some teachers will continue to teach. Children will continue to have good
morals as a result of the lessons we have taught them, and these are the benefits of this project.200’
MLRC, HI and UNICEF have developed a framework of materials and support which would enable
scaling and facilitate sustainability such as self-learning materials available on their webpages.
UNICEF have provided training, video clips and learning materials online which can be referenced and
used in the future. HI have also created online materials provided to build capacity of CSO and OPD to
identify and facilitate CwD. MLRC are creating self learning materials, video clips and other training
resources which they intend to place online such as softcopies of the NFE learning materials. Some IP
such as Succor Foundation reported that they had capacity to scale up the BBL as they already had the
right people in place with capacity developed. They noted that scaling up in the same region could be
achieved without refurbishment of centres if the same centres were used. These factors could help
reduce unit costs for each output area but operational costs and materials supply would remain
as unit costs.
3.6.3 (Q23) To what extent has BBL made progress toward localization as a
sustainability strategy? What recommendation can the Consultant(s) give in
terms of criteria for sustainability?
As noted under Q21 and Q22, the evidence for exit planning and sustainability is not yet strong.
Some IP are working with the Education Committees, centre heads and communities to discuss
sustainability but it is not occurring consistently or to a standardised methodology. There are aspects of
the BBL may be sustainable but which will likely require locally sourced funding to support long term.
Sustainability can be improved through: i) developing means of community funding; ii) partnering and
sharing of books between community hubs; iii) seeking volunteer facilitators; iv) developing a donor
support network for each library hub, possibly using the website to promote international assistance; v)
Partnering with local businesses for vocational training.

3.7 Gender Equality, Disability, Social Inclusion
3.7.1 (Q26) To what extent was BBL able to understand the needs related to gender
equality, disability, and other requirements for social inclusion? To what extent
did the design and implementation of BBL respond to these needs? (Relevance)
The design of the BBL reflected UNICEF’s extensive experience in all aspects of GEDSI as it
relates to children and vulnerable populations. The BBL design understood the needs of each
vulnerable group but was limited by resources and capacity of IP and thus clearly had to make
compromises in order to focus on the main goal of reaching as many children as possible during the twin
crisis. The BBL was inclusive and promoted inclusivity across each category of GEDSI. Provision
was made for inclusivity through means such as inclusive facilities, curriculum and community, parental
and facilitator training. Limited financial, output and outcome data relating to GEDSI prohibited a full
understanding of the capacity of BBL to address issues of GEDSI, although monitoring was improved
for Phase II implementation.
Phase II had greater allocation of resources towards GEDSI I but resources were limited when
compared to the demand. Gender equality was adequately addressed but the challenging area of
CWD was only partially addressed through the BBL. The environment was challenging owing to the
breakdown of social services during the twin crisis. For example, there were weak identification and
referral mechanisms for vulnerable children including CWD owing to a high demand and limited services
operating in each community.
There is significant scope to further address issues relating to GEDSI such as by addressing issues
of low male participation, strengthening identification and referral mechanisms for vulnerable children,
increasing the level of vocational education appropriate for each category of GEDSI, and aligning the
BBL with programmes or mechanisms providing pro poor support such as Social Policy and Child Rights
Monitoring (SPCRM) cash transfers to poor families. There is also capacity to strengthen linkages with
Ethnic Education Providers (EEC) in potential future iterations of the BBL.
3.7.1.1 BBL capacity to understand the needs relating to GEDSI
The BBL has a ‘focus on inclusivity with a particular attention to the situation of girls, CwD, ethnic
minorities and other marginalised groups. The BBL stresses that GEDSI mean that “no one must be left
behind” based on their sexual orientation, socio-economic status, ethnic or religious identity, gender, and
ability or disability’203.
The BBL design for Phase I and II emphasises inclusivity through: i) inclusion of gender-sensitive
learning materials that address issues specifically faced by girls, and through the mainstreaming of a
gender-sensitive approach to capacity building and training of hub facilitators204; ii) community hubs as
safe spaces with inclusive facilities including gender sensitive separated toilets (phase II) and the
promotion of hygiene including that specific to girls; iii) identification of the needs of CwDs through the
Washington Group/UNICEF Child Functioning module and ensuring accessibility for CwDs,, where
possible, through adaptations such as the provision of ramps, handrails, accessible screen viewers and
audio tapes but only in some of the community libraries; iv) distribution of special learning kits; v)
translation of early grade reading materials into ethnic languages in some cases; vi) facilitators trained
in identification and management of specific needs of the children in the classroom; vii) Sensitization for
facilitators, as well as community sensitization programs, towards promotion of inclusive participation,
203 UNICEF’s actions to mainstream gender across our interventions are guided by the UNICEF Gender Action Plan
(GAP) 2022–2025 and Gender Policy (2021-2-2023), which operationalizes the UNICEF Gender Policy, 2021–
2030, by specifying how UNICEF will promote gender equality across its programmes and workplaces.

as gender-based violence (GBV), early childhood marriage and domestic work duties in and around the home
for girls and child soldier recruitment for boys.

Prevention of Sexual Exploitation Abuse and Harassment (PSEAH), as well as stigma and
discrimination.
Child protection was also mainstreamed through training and capacity building of facilitators and through
teaching and learning materials. HI were engaged to provide general support to CWD through: Inclusive
home-based learning for children with disabilities through adaption of Open Learning materials for CWD;
Support CSO to build capacity of caregivers, facilitators and communities to encourage inclusion of CWD
in the BBL learning pathways205.
The BBL also targeted communities with a high concentration of ethnic and vulnerable children in regions
such as Kayin, Kayah, Bago, Tanintharyi, Chin, Kachin, Shan and Rakhine.
Budget allocation to CWD and other inclusion activities only partially available for the BBL Evaluation.
Training budgets include training on inclusion related matters, but training also included other topics and
so cannot be analysed in isolation. UNICEF and IP noted that budgets were often spent at the
community level for refurbishment of facilities and so were not available in consolidated format.
Allocation of inclusion related activities for each IP PDs varied. For example, BDA’s206 PD (8 December
2021) contains no specific reference to CWD or inclusion related activities in budget and planned
activities whilst KMSS in phase II included references to CWD training for outputs 1 and 2 but no budget
allocations for other elements.
3.7.1.2 Extent of the design and implementation of BBL respond to the needs of GENSI
Monitoring and Overview
98% (39 of 40) of centre heads and facilitators believed the BBL helped address the needs of vulnerable
children including children from poor families, ethnic children and CwD207. Most respondents believed
the BBL achieved this by encouraging all children to participate including those of poor or disadvantaged
backgrounds.
Robust empirical data on GEDSI was not fully available. Data was recorded and disaggregated
according to gender enabling monitoring and evaluation of gender related issues. Data was recorded
on total numbers of CWD but not specific to type. Data was recorded and disaggregated concerning
ethnic children but not by type of ethnicity and not other forms of marginalisation such as child labor,
children from poor families. Some data on rehabilitated facilities was available for phase I and more
comprehensive data was available for phase II. Data on financial allocations and outcomes relating to
GEDSI was only partially available which limited the capacity to fully understand the impact of the BBL
on GEDSI.
CWD
HI worked directly in Kachin and Rakhine regions to produce and distribute audio and braille versions of
Open Learning materials208, as well as learning kits for CWD. A Caregivers Guide in Myanmar and
English languages was piloted in Kachin and Rakhine states. Five read along story books were
translated into local Ethnic languages and some IP reported using their own resources to further provide
books in local ethnic languages.
For phase II UNICEF reported that all 65 learning centres had gender disaggregated toilets. The figure
below highlights the results of the 41 centres site inspected from Phase I and II for GEDSI related
practices and facilities. Only 44% of centres visited were observed to have had remedial learning

a) Good b) fair c) not good
The BBL was able to reach 849 CWD between 2021 and 2023 of which 351 of the targets of 462 (76%)
were reached in Phase II. Numbers by education stream were: ECCD (male 145, female 100, GPI 0.69)
Open Learning (Male 330, female 216, GPI 0.65), NFE (male 26, female 32, GPI 1.23). This represents
0.19% of the total number of children reached through the BBL. Estimates place the percentage of CWD
at approximately 17%209 so the BBL may have reached just 1.1% of the total number of CWD in target
communities. Only about half of the IP recorded having CWD participate in the BBL210.
HI reported that budget for CWD was inadequate and that CWD and their specific needs should
be identified during budget preparation to allow budget for individual care211. They also noted that
the BBL duration was too short to affect significant impact for CWD. Only 26% (10 of 39) of KII involving
centre heads and facilitators believed the BBL addressed the needs of CWD which were almost all
schools under Succor Foundation in Magway and Sagaing.
Centre heads and facilitators noted the following issues: i) CWD are unable or unwilling to go to school
owing to inability, fear or stigmatism; ii) there is a lack of vocational education for CWD; iii) Lack of proper
equipment and training for CWD; iv) CWD suffer depression, bullying and low self-esteem which affects
their learning.
Htun212, aged 9, lives in Magway state with his father, a farmer and his mother. He attends the BBL
programme under the Succor Foundation and is enrolled in EXCEL pathway. Htun has hearing
difficulties and is identified as a CWD. Htun’s family was unable to work and earn an income and thus,
before the BBL commenced, he was unable to attend school. Upon BBL starting he began attending the
library and became inclined to read. He believes reading has improved his knowledge and givn him
confidence. He has enjoyed playing on the tablet provided under the BBL and looks forward to attending
a deaf school in Yangon in the future. He hopes to one day become a teacher.

Kywe213, aged 22, is from Magway state and lives with his parents and sibling. He is studying under
the BBL NFPE programme operated by KMSS. He is classified as a CWD having lost his ability to use
both legs after an illness. Before this BBL he was reluctant to study and didn’t want to go to school on
his own. He described himself as feeling angry and embarrassed as a result of his difficulties. Since
commencing the BBL he has learnt to write, to be patient and is learning how to craft. After BBL, he
would like to proceed to vocational education.
Gender
The majority of facilitators trained in each learning pathway were females. ECCD (GPI 4.32); Open
Learning (GPI 2.36); NFE (GPI 1.95). In general participation favoured girls across all learning pathways
and in all regions as indicated in the figure below. GPI for ECCD was 1.02, Open Learning was 1.06,
and NFE was 1.02 indicating greater participation of girls across all learning pathways, but not
necessarily in proportion to the total in the population214. All centres under Phase II had gender
disaggregated toilets, however of those visited for site inspection as part of the BBL Evaluation only
70% of centres (phase I and II) had gender disaggregated toilets available (refer figure above).
32% (13 of 41) of centre heads/facilitators believed the BBL addressed the needs of gender. Most
believed there was nothing specific about the BBL that addressed gender issues and others believed it
supported and encouraged both girls and boys without discrimination215.
Respondents noted issues which included: i) In many cases boys are struggling more than girls; the
need for children to attend more discussions or educational classes on gender; iii) Vocational education
appropriate to both gender.

Ethnic Children and those from Poor Backgrounds
12,743 (GPI 1.02) ethnic children were recorded in Chin, Kachin, Kayin, Kayah and Mon being 6% of
the total number of children estimated to have been reached. 28% (10 of 36) of centre heads and
facilitators believed the BBL has addressed the needs of Children from Ethnic Backgrounds. 86% (31
of 36) believed the BBL has addressed the needs of Children from Poor Families with many centres
noting that the majority of children attending were from poor families216.
The following issues prohibited participation of children from poor backgrounds217: i) Working and
Financial difficulties; ii) Reluctance of parents to send children to school/centres which reduces their
enthusiasm for study; iii) Discrimination; iv) Inability to pay school fees resulting in exclusion from
education and lack of interest in education; v) lack of education opportunities at home; vi) lack of food,
clothing and shelter making education difficult.
Respondents believed the BBL helped children from marginalised backgrounds but that further efforts
were required including: i) Encouraging parents to send children to learn; ii) Provide cloths and food; iii)
Ensure teachers are also indigenous people and can speak the language; iii) vocational education; iv)
Coordinate working hours and classes to comply with the children’s work schedules.
The Social Policy and Child Rights Monitoring (SPCRM) section of UNICEF is supporting cash transfer
to poor families of ECCD children. Coordination and harmonise tools with those used by SPCRM could
help BBL to identify and target and other disadvantaged children including CWD. SPCRM have also
developed a case management tool which could be used to track vulnerable children and UNICEF have
used Primero218 in other countries as a case management tool for vulnerable children.
There is also opportunities to strengthen linkages with Ethnic Education Providers (EEC) such as via the
Myanmar Education Consortium (MEC) and Rural Indigenous Sustainable Education (RISE).
Nyunt219 is the head of a library centre located in Magway and operated under the Succor Foundation.
He believes that earning promotes positive change in the lives of children. He states that ‘The BBL
has given knowledge to children from poor families and is having a big impact. There is a person with
physical disability in our school who is in the eighth grade. They are attending the EXCEL pathways
course and are from a poor family.’ He acknowledges that it has been challenging to teach children
owing to the limited resources and he would like to be able to do much more to help the children
including providing financial help and food assistance.
3.7.2 (Q27) Have representatives from women’s groups, Organisations of Persons
with Disabilities (OPDs), and other groups for marginalized communities been
involved in understanding the needs and response of BBL? (Relevance)
Most (66%, 27 of 41) of centre heads and facilitators believed representatives from women’s groups,
OPDs, and other groups for marginalized communities been involved in understanding the needs and
response of BBL. Representatives helped if asked, were referenced if necessary, or involved indirectly,
or had people on the education committee, but were not usually directly involved. In general women’s
involvement was encouraged under the BBL. For example, the PTA guidelines specify at least 50%
involvement of women and the majority of facilitators were women.
Examples of representatives from special groups included: Ethnic Language and Cultural Committees
throughout Myanmar; The Women’s Affairs League; The Bawinu Foundation; Religious
216 Respondents noted aspects of the BBL which enabled children from poor families to participate. These included
backpacks; books; the orientation and encouragement of parents; and free pedagogical materials.

groups/congregation; NGO such as Family Wave; The Red Cross. However, most respondents were
unable to give specific examples of assistance or involvement.
There is scope to increase involvement from these groups through greater promotion and
awareness of the BBL. The Education Committee is a good mechanism for ensuring participation but
may not be suitable for larger organisations. Increasing coordination at the grass roots level may help
to involve partners from other sectors or organisations willing to assist the BBL at the grassroots level.
3.7.3 (Q28) Did the project budget make adequate provisions for all important goals,
e.g. addressing gender and inclusion related specific objectives/activities?
(Efficiency)
As noted under (Q26), gender inclusion targets were exceeded in terms of girl’s participation, but it is
not clear whether all gender issues were addressed. Concerns were expressed concerning boys’
lower participation in some areas. Many facilities renovated under Phase I did not have adequate gender
disaggregated toilets but all facilities under phase II do220.
There was inadequate budget allocated to fully address the issue of CWD. General support was
given such as providing learning materials for hearing impaired, ramps for CWD with mobility issues and
inclusive education training for facilitators. The barriers towards identification and participation of CWD
are significant and may require a greater contribution of resources, and a more wholistic approach, to
properly address. HI recommend undertaking scoping work prior to assigning budget so as to properly
determine the number and type of CWD and the specific needs which should be addressed for each.
3.7.4 (Q29) What factors of BBL have worked well to achieve results for girls, and
what has worked less well? For children with disabilities? For children from
ethnic groups? And other traditionally marginalized populations? (Effectiveness
and Impact)
There are many approaches undertaken by the BBL which have been effective which are detailed under
(Q26)221. One of the most beneficial aspects of the BBL was mainstreaming inclusive messaging
through most aspects of the programme and the development of learning centres and hubs as
fully inclusive spaces222. Inclusivity was mainstreamed through learning materials, training given to
facilitators, communities and parents and this helped ensure the participation of vulnerable groups
classified under GEDSI. Inclusivity was emphasized through aspects of the BBL such as MHPSS,
PSEAH and EXCEL pathways and these had a positive impact on the attitude of children, parents and
facilitators. Inclusivity was also encouraged through many aspects of the BBL including the provision of
books in ethnic languages, facilitators fluent in local languages and renovation of facilities to include
gendered toilets and disability friendly facilities. However limited resources impacted the degree to which
GEDSI could be fully addressed and there were areas where greater application of resources can help
ensure the BBL is more inclusive.

3.7.5 (Q30) What evidence exists that any gains toward GEDSI will be sustained?
What recommendations are there for future projects for sustainable efforts
toward GEDSI? (Sustainability)
Some gains towards GEDSI are likely to be maintained but greater evidence should be obtained
to confirm the tentative findings presented in the BBL Evaluation . Aspects which are likely to be
sustained include: i) Positive attitudinal changes concerning inclusion amongst parents, facilitators and
communities which help promote participation in learning for vulnerable and marginalized children; ii)
ECCD being taught partly in local ethnic languages and with access to story books in the local ethnic
languages.; iii) Renovations to learning centers which promote inclusivity including disability friendly
facilities and gendered toilets; iv) The availability of inclusive learning materials such as the Open
Learning and Open Learning materials.
The sustainability of other elements will be subject to continued community support for learning centres
and teaching. Continued support will help ensure continuity of inclusive lessons such as EXCEL
Pathways, identification, inclusion and referral of CWD and other elements which require continued
efforts to maintain. The continuity of these aspects of the BBL will be dependent on communities
developing effective sustainability strategies to ensure continuation of the BBL after the end of funding
support.

4 Conclusions, Recommendations and Lessons Learned
4.1 Conclusions
4.1.1 Relevance
1. The BBL project was highly relevant to the needs of children affected by the twin crisis.
The BBL’s composite approach to community and home-based learning for children aged 3-18
provides a synergistic effect to support engagement with key target groups with a focus on
disadvantaged children and regions/states.
2. Project areas were chosen to include states that were severely impacted by the conflict
and crisis both thematic and geographical for both phases. However, the extent of the twin
crisis on children throughout Myanmar was so extensive that areas and communities requiring
BBL could not be included owing to resource constraints.
3. Myanmar has a community-based society and so strengthening and sustaining community
library centers is an effective means of facilitating delivery of essential social services to
crisis affected children. Opportunities for remedial and catchup learning for crisis
affected children through the delivery of ECCD, Open Learning, community centers, Outreach
programme. NFE helped engage children who were OOSC.
4. The objectives and implementation strategies of the BBL programme been highly
consistent with the requirements of the target groups and country needs. The BBL aligns
with the needs identified in key policy and strategic documents including the Political Economy
Analysis (PEA)224, UNCT guidelines, the JRF, and UNICEF’s policies and guidelines, the
Humanitarian Response Plan (2021), the Socio-Economic Resilience and Response Plan
(SERRP) and the approach defined in the Myanmar Education Cluster Strategy (MECS) (2022-
2025).
5. The implementation strategies have been flexible to meet the needs of different
communities based on location within the general framework and resource constraints
of the BBL. The mechanism of working with trusted IP and assigning them responsibility to
liaise with and select communities has facilitated implementation during the period of the twin
crisis.
6. Education Committees whose capacity was developed throughout the BBL provided a
strong mechanism to encourage community participation and ownership.
4.1.2 Coherence
7. The BBL complements and fits with community level activities to advocate home and
community level learning among children. Many communities do not have access to
education services and so the BBL provides an avenue for those children to receive an
education. Anecdotal evidence indicates the BBL promotes positive behavioural for children
which has helped them engage with each other, parents and the community and to adapt during
and after the dramatic effect of the twin crisis.
8. Many communities had contributed resources such as through provision of materials,
supplementing facilitator wages and feeding children. However, there is scope to further
tailor the BBL to the needs of communities through increased provision of vocational education
relevant to local demands however this would require greater resources. Mobilising
communities and public private partnerships are potential means for enhancing vocational
education opportunities through the BBL.
224 Restricted access
70
9. Robust coordination mechanisms such as the Education Cluster Group and UNICEF
planning meetings helped ensure there was no overlap between programmes operated
by different development partners or between IP. There were opportunities to improve
coordination between different sectors at the regional/state level, to help ensure a wholistic
approach towards child development.
10. Phase I targets were exceeded for most indicators. For Phase II, the budget was defined
adequately ex ante in terms of total beneficiaries reached which significantly exceeded
targets in all categories. In all an estimated total of 209,340 children (GPI 1.03) were reached
by the BBL Phase I and II225. The outreach programme exceeded the target by 130% (229%
of) demonstrating its cost effectiveness in terms of reaching children. There were
challenges in properly addressing issues relating to CWD such as the demand and requirement
for specialized resources and teaching.
11. Fund transfers, banking and supplying materials were problematic owing to challenges
imposed by the crisis, especially during the first year of the BBL (first part of Phase I). IP
had problems with receiving funds transferred. UNICEF and IP demonstrated determination,
flexibility and adaptability throughout to overcome most problems However resulting
delays did impact the ability of some IP to coordinate activities which impacted the capacity of
some IP to operate over the short DP timeframes of 6 to 18 months.
12. Resources such as human resources, time, expertise, supplies, transportation, and funds
had been effectively allocated and used to achieve the BBL objectives. The cost per child
(unit cost) for Phase I were ECCD (36 USD), Open Learning (71 USD) and NFE (149 USD).
The average cost per child for Phase I was 71 USD per child compared to 56 USD per child226.
These figures compare favorably with comparative programmes undertaken in Myanmar. The
BBL Evaluation found no evidence that the same results could be achieved with fewer
resources.
13. The BBL was a cost-effective means of delivering education services to disadvantaged
communities and in many communities and the costs were ultimately justified. The BBL
provided the means to engage children in ECCD, ensure remedial and catchup learning to
children affected by the twin crisis, and re-engage OOSC in NFE. The costs were justified when
compared to the social and economic cost of not educating children.
14. Communication, feedback and coordination mechanisms were robust but limited by
security and privacy concerns imposed by the military takeover. Beneficiaries and target
groups have been involved in decision making at the start of implementation and during
implementation through a mixture of qualitative and quantitative feedback mechanisms.
15. The evaluation determined that the BBL has contributed to reengagement of children to
learning at community level although most evidence is currently anecdotal.
4.1.3 Effectiveness and Impact
16. The BBL strategy and programme management have been steering towards impact and
set up in a way to allow achievement of expected outcomes and impacts. The causal
relationships between activities, outputs and outcomes is logical and the BBL Evaluation
determined that the strategy has been effective. Phase I was designed as emergency response
225 Calculated as the number of individual children recorded for the 2022 year.
226 Costs were determined by dividing the total amount allocated to a phase or learning stream by the total number
of children benefiting under that phase or learning stream. For phase II budget was not available disaggregated
by learning stream. Therefore phase II unit costs do not reflect the costs for each individual learning stream
which are likely to reflect Phase I costs.
71
and Phase II has a more clearly defined strategy towards measuring outcomes and ensuring
sustainability.
17. The BBL is helping address the learning crisis. Its estimated that at least 209,340227 of
1,400,000 crisis affected children were reached by the BBL, being 14.9% of the total but with
a focus on disadvantaged and conflict regions.
4.1.4 Sustainability (and Scalability)
18. The objectives of sustainability need to be clearly defined and subsequently a realistic
and effective exit strategy has not been developed for the BBL but is included in the
Phase II strategy as an objective and in the new programme QBEP4C. Amongst IP there
was a lack of uniformity in approach towards exit planning. The benefits of the project will
likely be sustained or institutionalized and scaled in the future but the evidence is
moderate and lacks a strong empirical basis. Concerns were expressed over finances
required for operational expenses, facilitator wages, materials, maintaining quality and other
aspects.
19. There are many scalable elements inherent in the approach to the BBL including: i) the
capacity which has been developed in IP to implement the learning centre and hub model; ii)
The framework of support to IP, learning centres and the training and open learning materials
developed under MLRC, HI and UNICEF; iii) The trainers at the sub-national level who can be
utilized to train facilitators in new communities and give support to facilitators in existing learning
centers. These elements of the BBL mean that the cost of implementing in new centers
can be reduced thus reducing the cost per child in each of the three learning pathways.
However operational costs, renovation, capacity development and material supply costs at the
learning center would remain constant.
4.1.5 Gender Equality, Disability, Social Inclusion
20. The design of the BBL reflected UNICEF’s extensive experience in all aspects of GEDSI
as it relates to children and vulnerable populations. The BBL design understood the needs
of each vulnerable group but was limited by resources and capacity of IP and thus had to
make compromises to focus on the main goal of reaching as many children as possible during
the twin crisis. The BBL was inclusive and promoted inclusivity across each category of
GEDSI. Provision as made for inclusivity through means such as inclusive facilities, curriculum
and community, parental and facilitator training.
21. Phase II had greater allocation of resources towards GEDSI but resources were limited
when compared to the demand. Gender was adequately addressed but the challenging area
of CWD was only partially addressed through the BBL which focused on sight and hearing
impaired children. The breakdown of social services during the twin crisis further hampered the
capacity to address GEDSI fully. For example, there were weak identification and referral
mechanisms for vulnerable children including CWD owing to a high demand and limited services
operating in each community.
22. There was inadequate budget allocated to more fully address the issue of CWD. General
support was given such as providing learning materials for hearing and sight impaired, ramps
for CWD with mobility issues and inclusive education training for facilitators. Targets were
achieved in both phases. However the barriers towards identification and participation of CWD
are significant and may require a greater contribution of resources, and a more wholistic
approach, to properly address.
227 This represents the known minimum number of children reached (2022). The total number is subject to error
owing to possible double counting.
72
23. Inclusivity and acceptance were also emphasized through aspects of the BBL through
the emphasis on MHPSS and PSEAH which had a positive impact on the attitude of
children, parents and facilitators. Inclusivity was also emphasized through many aspects of
the BBL such as the provision of books in ethnic languages, facilitators fluent in local languages
and renovation of facilities to include gendered toilets and disability friendly facilities.
24. Some gains towards GEDSI are likely to be maintained but greater evidence should be
obtained to confirm the tentative findings presented in the BBL Evaluation . Aspects which
are likely to be sustained include: i) Positive attitudinal changes concerning inclusion amongst
parents, facilitators and communities which help promote participation in learning for vulnerable
and marginalized children; ii) ECCD being taught partly in local ethnic languages and with access
to story books in the local ethnic languages.; iii) Renovations to learning centers which promote
inclusivity including disability friendly facilities and gendered toilets; iv) The availability of
inclusive learning materials such as the Open Learning and Open Learning materials.
4.2 Recommendations
Recommendations are classified as either high priority (immediate) or medium priority (6-12 months).
Management/coordination
I. Priority Medium; Links to Conclusion 9,15
Improve coordination mechanisms at the regional/state and district level to help ensure
a wholistic approach towards child development through enhanced collaboration of
projects/programmes which may be taking place in different sectors. Work with
programmes which aim to strengthen social systems at the community level such as
pro-poor funding, school feeding and referral and support for CwD. Addressing the
impact of the twin crisis on children requires a coordinated effort from the Education, Health,
Nutrition and Child Protection sectors. The benefits of the BBL can be synergized with other
programmes and UNICEF have applied mechanisms at the national level to achieve this.
Opportunities for potential future synergy were identified such as complementing the BBL with
child feeding programmes, clothing, pro poor support and basic literacy programmes to help
address health, wellbeing and participation of ethnic children and children from poor families.
This also highlights the need to strengthen the social systems at community level which have
been impacted by the twin crisis. For example, there were weak identification and referral
mechanisms for vulnerable children including CWD owing to a high demand and limited
services operating in each community. The BBL can also be aligned with mechanisms
providing pro poor support such as Social Policy and Child Rights Monitoring (SPCRM) cash
transfers to poor families.
Implementation,
II. Priority Medium ; Links to Evaluation Q5, Q6
Implement a consistent and transparent method of site selection for learning centers
which should include criteria for selection and sufficient data including data on existing
interventions. Explore methods to establish learning centers in communities in which IP
may not have established relationships. IP have selected communities with which they are
able to work. However, there are many communities in which IP do not have established
means of operating but which may benefit from the BBL, given the extent of the twin crisis on
learning. It will be important to investigate mechanisms by which communities where IP do not
have established relationships may implement the BBL. This may require greater involvement
from other Ethnic Education Providers and others who may facilitate. However, increasing the
number of IP will have burdens on administrative and capacity development costs.
III. Priority Medium; Links to Evaluation Q8
73
Review options for local procurement of materials, empowering communities to
produce materials locally and for variations in costs of some budget items may help
motivate and empower communities. There are variations in costs regionally such as for
facilitator wages and transportation costs which are influenced by the extent of conflict and
security. However, this would likely require greater monitoring to ensure accountability,
effectiveness and quality are maintained. The Education Cluster is about to release its
standard cost estimation for items such as teaching and learning kits which will help make the
price consistent but may not fully account for regional variations.
IV. Priority Medium; Links to Conclusion 8
Investigate options to increase opportunities for vocational education which can lead to
local employment or business opportunities. Consider identifying a CSO who can lead
with vocational education. Many children work in or seek employment in the vocational sector
and opportunities for vocational education would help create economic and employment
opportunities which are desperately needed by many poorer families. There is scope to further
tailor the BBL to the needs of communities through increased provision of vocational education
relevant to local employment demands and to accommodate CWD. There is also scope to
include gender sensitization and inclusion in vocational training to help overcome perceptions of
gendered training. It will be important to identify the types of vocational education which are
feasible, cost effective and may be supported through programmes similar to the BBL.
V. Priority Medium; Links to Evaluation Q9
Review capacity to enhance NFE vocational course offerings through the use of Public
Private Partnerships (PPP). NFE per child is more expensive than other modes of education.
There may be potential to reduce costs for NFE by scaling implementation, retaining trainers
and facilitators, mentoring, and forming Public Private Partnerships (PPP) to increase the
number of vocational course offerings. PPP would also help create employment opportunities
for students completing NFE. PPP may be difficult under the current security climate but as
conflict reduces it should be feasible to build partnerships at the local level.
VI. Priority High ; Links to Evaluation Question:: 19, 20
Work with Education Committees to develop a realistic and effective costed model for
sustainability which can be used to guide communities and help them decide which
aspects of the BBL are to be sustained. Define what is meant by a Replicable
Community Learning Resource Centre model. This may mean creating several different
models based on community size, capacity and ability to operate as a hub to other
communities. This will likely entail defining what is meant by replicable, what an exit strategy
means and how it relates to sustainability. Ideally, each community should generate an exit
plan with a sustainability plan based on the costed model. Continued investment into the
capacity development of CSO and Education Committees will also help ensure sustainability.
VII. Priority High ; Links to Evaluation Question: 19, 20
Develop a donor support network for each learning center, possibly using the website
to promote international assistance and investigating capacity to partner with local
businesses. Strengthen efforts to link communities with donors and CSO to help
facilitate continued support to learning centers after BBL has concluded. Efforts towards
sustainability need to be combined with a gradual migration of children back to government
delivered education support. This should be undertaken under the context of increasing
education support for attending public schools as communities increasingly opt for
governments schools under the SAC
VIII. Priority Medium ; Links to Evaluation Q20
74
Increase representation from women’s groups, Organisations of Persons with
Disabilities (OPDs), and other groups for marginalized communities through greater
promotion and awareness of the BBL. The Education Committee is a good mechanism for
ensuring participation of community representatives but may not be suitable for larger
organisations. Increasing coordination at the grass roots level may help to involve partners
from other sectors or organisations willing to assist the BBL at the grassroots level.
IX. Priority Medium ; Links to Evaluation Q23
Review methods to reduce facilitator turnover. Facilitator turnover results in increased
costs and impacts the quality of service delivery as new facilitators need to be trained and
orientated. The reopening of SAC schools has led to some facilitators returning to teaching
jobs. There may be a limited means to reduce turnover but options should be considered such
as increasing renumeration or recruiting from retired teachers. The Education Cluster's
standard rate of incentive for community volunteers will be made public soon and may help
guide renumeration but it may not account for variations between regions/communities.
Finance and Budgeting
XIII. Priority High ; Links to Evaluation Q8
Consider extending the period for liquidation of finances to 7 months under emergency
situations. The period allowed to declare liquidation of finances was too short as activities
often had to be delayed owing to conflict and other issues resulting from the twin crisis. As an
alternative investigate methods to enable greater flexibility in the utilization and disbursement
of funds under the emergency situation.
XIV. Priority High; Links to Conclusion 23
Consider allocating budget for CWD in accordance with the number and types of CWD
identified in each area. CWD have many barriers towards participation in essential services
in Myanmar and the challenges to ensuring CWD are engaged in education are significant228.
BBL has promoted inclusivity, trained facilitators and helped to address pedagogical and
facility requirements but the issues facing CWD are significant and require significant
resources to address. The budget allocated to BBL to address CWD was insufficient when
compared to the demand and need. The budget for CWD was defined at the start of the BBL
which is problematic because numbers and severity of CWD were not quantified. Severe
disabilities required specialized equipment, services or training which were expensive and not
budgeted for under the BBL. Continued cooperation with HI and continued capacity
development of IP will be required to help address this significant and challenging area in the
context of low awareness and capacity.
Monitoring/reporting
XV. Priority Medium ; Links to Conclusion 15
Improve mechanisms for reviewing, incorporating and communicating feedback from IP
and beneficiaries and standardize community engagement and feedback mechanisms
amongst all IP. The use of secure electronic communication tools such as Viber, Whatsapp,
or Real Time Monitoring (RTM) software would enable rapid feedback to be obtained,
consolidated, and easily analysed allowing for more rapid and targeted response229.

229 MCO have commenced use of these platforms to facilitate monitoring functions.
75
XVI. Priority High ; Links to Evaluation Q26
Improve data monitoring processes, data standards and data tools used to collect data
on attendance, learning outcomes and participation in learning pathways. IP have used
their own tools for data management and the quality and robustness of data can be improved.
This will help ensure that richer data on CWD and ethnic children is available for monitoring
and evaluation. This will have to be balanced with the need to ensure data privacy, given the
insecurities inherent in the communities under the BBL.
XVII. Priority Medium ; Links to Evaluation Q26
Consider the use of case management tools to help identify and track vulnerable
children such as CWD. Case management tools can also be effectively applied for vulnerable
children such as CWD. UNICEF and UNHCR use Primero230 which has been effective for
referral and tracking of vulnerable children231.
XVIII. Priority High ; Links to Evaluation Q26
Improve methods of evaluation to determine the effectiveness of the BBL on gender
inclusivity. There is a need to understand the impact of Gender inclusivity on girls safety
within the community and on changing attitudes to girls participation in education. There is
also a need to address the issue of low male participation in the BBL which may relate to the
low participation and achievement of boys in education throughout Southeast Asia.
XIX. Priority High; Links Evaluation Question 19
Develop indicators and Means of Verification for evaluating the impact of the. For the
two BBL outcomes the following indicator recommendations are included.
a. Objective 1: Continuity of expected quality learning including Life skills and
Socio Emotional Learning (SEL) and wellbeing for children and adolescents
attained: i) Retention of children learning under the three learning pathways and
transition rates into the Formal education system preferred in each location which
could also be monastic, ethnic education, etc.; ii) Tracer studies on children having
attended each of the three learning outputs; iii) Learning and behavioral impact for
children having attended each of the three output learning pathways and in literacy,
numeracy and science; iv) Learning and behavioral impact on children classified under
GEDSI; v) Changes in attitudes and behavior of parents/caregivers/educators; vi) The
impact of coordination with other programmes such as those concerned with nutrition
and child protection
b. Objective 2: Replicable Community Learning Resource Centre model tested and
piloted: i) The number of communities adopting the Community Learning Resource
Centre (CLRC) model by establishing their own library or hub which were not part of
the BBL; ii) Contribution of CSO and Community funds to the continuity of the CLRC
model; iii) Number of CLRC which are sustained both as centres and hubs; iv)
Retention of facilitators and the aspects of sustainability of learning centres post BBL.
XX. Priority High ; Links to Evaluation Question 18.
Modify the TOC to include elements identified by the BBL Evaluation including the
addition of Assumptions: i) Working through CSO who have established relationships in target
regions and who align with and understand ethnic groups in each region; ii) Local flexibility in
adaption of the BBL activities enabling it to meet the needs of different communities.
230 Source: https://www.primero.org/.
231 SPCRM have also developed a case management tool which could be used to track vulnerable children which
may be based on Primero
76
Challenges can include the impact of environment and social unrest, Conflict and Security
issues. The addition of external assumptions for the BBL logic may be included which are: i)
Continued partner commitment towards funding programmes within Myanmar; ii) Continued
ability to be able to operate within the regions selected; iii) CSO support towards improving
children and adolescents’ rights to education and protection; iv) Stable and timely funding for
BBL activities in general; v) Political status quo ensuring the current situation continues.
4.3 Lessons Learned
I. In situations where direct engagement with government may be restricted, working through CSO
who have established relationships in target regions and who align with and understand ethnic
groups in each region can help mitigate risks such as security, remote access and intransient
local officials. In crisis situations internet connectivity may fail but phone networks often function.
This poses challenges for general communication and delivery of capacity building such as via
online training. Building up local networks, recruiting local trainers and working through local
CSO provide means of circumventing these limitations.
II. Too many partnerships (IP) complicate administrative, monitoring and financial arrangements,
require larger overheads for management and administration and can result in variations in
quality and approach between implementation partners. Reducing the number of partnerships
can help optimize resources but may reduce geographic spread.
III. Community engagement and ownership from the start of the implementation such as that
provided through the Education Committee’s and PTA, is critical to ensuring participation and
ownership. Investing in local/national CSOs and in communities (especially PTAs/education
management committees), especially to build capacity for their engagement in education, is very
likely to have ongoing benefits for access and quality of education.
IV. Community learning centers are appropriate vehicles to help deliver catchup education, remedial
education and other forms of education such as ECCD and NFE which can help complement
existing government education. They can provide limited education services in environments
where access to formal education may be limited or inhibited by constraints such as security and
access.
V. In challenging and deprived environments it is necessary to ensure a wholistic approach towards
development (the development nexus) including MHPSS, Child Protection, WASH, Nutrition and
peace building. This will help address all aspects of a child’s health and wellbeing which are
essential to ensuring safe engagement in learning.
VI. Parental education and sensitization are essential towards ensuring and encouraging children’s
ongoing and sustained engagement with education and, in particular for parents of vulnerable
children such as CWD.
VII. Allowing flexibility towards budgeting and adjusting budgets for PD is necessary under crisis
situations.
VIII. Where sustainability is an issue consideration should be given to maintaining programme
support for 3-5 years and considering sustainable institutional arrangements such as maintaining
capacity after the programme ends. Communities in Myanmar have scant resources available
so it is important to identify ways to reduce operational budgets and supplement funds locally to
help ensure sustainability.
IX. In crisis situations, banking and transport systems can fail and therefore consideration needs to
be given to flexible modes of ensuring funds and materials reach communities. Local
procurement can accelerate emergency response but needs quality standards and greater
efforts to monitor. Also during L1 or L2 emergencies supply is often overwhelmed and
77
consideration should be given to ensuring temporary Technical Assistance (TA) is made
available to help ease constraints.
X. Developing innovative ways of measuring outcomes during periods of emergency response,
such as learning and behavioral changes, is important to understanding the impact and
effectiveness of response. Whilst not a high priority during L1 and L2 they provide data to help
inform changes where appropriate.
XI. Strengthening and sustaining community library centers is an effective means of facilitating
delivery of essential social services to vulnerable children. Myanmar is a community-based
society and has mechanisms developed to foster community participation and engagement with
programs such as BBL.

Annex A Terms of Reference
International Consultant to undertake the Evaluation of Bring Back Learning
Programme in Myanmar
A.1 Scope of Work:
The Terms of Reference (ToR) set out the purpose, objectives, methodology and operational modalities
for an individual consultancy to evaluate the Bringing Back Learning programme to improve and
strengthen its implementation. This evaluation will assess the Bringing Back Learning programme over
the entire project period and across different funding, from June 2021 to June 2023. The evaluation shall
provide evidence on how the programme has progressed as envisaged initially, whether its processes
have effectively contributed to its stated objectives and achieved the intended results during that period.
Because an understanding of achievements to date will be necessary to identify how processes
contribute to the results. The process evaluation will provide secondary evidence on the TOC, and the
extent to which project objectives have been reached. The focus will be on the relevance of the various
strategies in meeting the education needs of children in a dual crisis situation.
The consultant hired under this ToR will take a closer look at the processes which have led to the
fulfillment/non- fulfillment of the programme objectives. He/she will particularly consider (1) the way each
of the involved partners has fulfilled their part of the initiatives obligations as well as (2) how communities
and partners have collaborated to reach the project’s objectives. Further, the consultant will (3) provide
additional qualitative and quantitative evidence of fulfillment/nonfulfillment of the project’s objectives.
The primary audiences for this process evaluation are the project’s main implementing partners and
stakeholders including donors of the project BBL.
A.2 Key Questions:
Based on the ToC, the consultant hired under these ToR will take a closer look at the processes which
have led to fulfillment/non-fulfilment of the project’s objectives. He/she will particularly consider (1) the
way each of the involved partners has fulfilled their part of the project’s obligations as well as (2) how
communities and partners have collaborated to reach the project’s objectives. Further, the consultant
will (3) provide quantitative and qualitative evidence of fulfillment/nonfulfillment of the project’s objectives.
The evaluation will comprise of mixed-methods/process-focused part and will be based on the
OECD/DAC criteria232. Following these criteria, the evaluation will explore the relevance, effectiveness,
efficiency, impact, and sustainability of the project. Within the criteria, there will also be an emphasis on
gender equality, disability, and other types of social inclusion (GEDSI). Questions related to GEDSI are
outlined separately below to add to this emphasis. The process evaluation focuses, as the name implies,
on the criteria of effectiveness and efficiency. The goal of the proposed qualitative evaluation is to embed
these results into the broader context of the project. For each of the OECD/DAC criteria, key questions
are defined below. These key questions define the results that the evaluator is expected to provide.
There is no baseline for this programme so this process evaluation will provide evidence for further
programming in Myanmar within the criteria of relevance, efficiency, and sustainability, while taking into
account (and evaluating from a broader perspective) the provided results on effectiveness and potentially
(early) impact. The evaluator is invited to propose (additional) sub-questions to these criteria as he/she
sees fit.

A.3 Suggested Methodology:
Based on the objectives of the evaluation, this section indicates a possible approach, methods, and
processes for the evaluation. Methodological rigor will be given significant consideration in the
assessment of the proposals. Hence consultants are invited to interrogate the approach and
methodology proffered in the ToR and improve on it, or propose an approach they deem more
appropriate, which should be guided by the UNICEF’s revised Evaluation Policy (2018) , the United
Nations Evaluation Group(UNEG) Norms and Standards for Evaluation (2016) , UNEG Guidance on
Integrating Human Rights and Gender Equality in Evaluation (2014) , UN SWAP Evaluation Performance
Indicator, UNEG Ethical Guidelines for Evaluation (2020) , UNICEF Procedure for Ethical Standards and
Research, Evaluation and Data Collection and Analysis (2021) and UNICEF-Adapted UNEG Evaluation
Report Standards (2017). Moreover, the evaluation should consider throughout issues of equity, gender
equality and human rights. In their proposal, consultants should clearly refer to triangulation, sampling
plan, ethical considerations (including, ethical clearance) and methodological limitations and mitigation
measures. They are encouraged to also demonstrate methodological expertise in evaluating education
programmes.
It is expected that the evaluation will employ non-experimental, mixed methods approach drawing on
key project documents, the constructed TOC and the monitoring framework for guidance.
The evaluation takes a process evaluation approach with the purpose of informing the potential
adjustments in the Programme design and its delivery system. At minimum, the evaluation will draw on
233 In Myanmar, other types of marginalization to consider include but are not limited to: ethnic minority
groups, IDPs, and stateless populations.
81
the following methods that would allow both processes as well as achievement of results and early
impacts to be assessed.
I. Desk review of project documents and other relevant data Review and analysis of secondary
quantitative data;
II. Key Informant Interviews (KIIs); Focus Group Discussions (FGDs);
III. Case studies of children participating in the project; x Cost-effectiveness analysis; Observation
of Programme processes;
IV. Consultant is encouraged to propose alternative quantitative and/or qualitative tools supporting
collection of data amongst programme beneficiaries and implementers
The evaluation is expected to be done remotely, though in person data collection will be done by a team
of enumerators who will need to be organized/recruited by the team leader. In case the team leader
cannot find a team of enumerators, UNICEF can provide details of partners who could support data
collection. These would be hired and managed by the evaluation team leader.
The Programme has national coverage. Thus, locations selected for data collection need to be proposed
by the consultant, along with a sampling framework and detailed considerations for the selection of the
locations. Locations selected should lead to the evaluation considering different contexts/ circumstances
of programme implementation. Locations will be finally agreed on with UNICEF.
The data collected should be disaggregated by sex, age, disability, states, etc. where relevant and focus
on both the implementers and the rights holders (children and caregivers) and the key informants at
central and sub-national levels.
Sampling of KIIs and FGDs should be done in consultation with UNICEF. The evaluation sample should
reconsider a balance of criteria such as socioeconomic indicators, remoteness, ethnicities, etc., as well
as conditions related to safety and access.
To enrich the analysis, the evaluation will use to the extent possible, quantitative/qualitative data
gathered by UNICEF such as donor reports, Quarterly reports from Implementing partners, Annual report
2021 and field monitoring reports
Conventional ethical guidelines are to be followed during the evaluation. Specific reference is made to
the revised UNEG Norms and Standards for Evaluation in the UN System and UNEG Ethical Guidelines
as well as to the UNICEF’s revised Evaluation Policy, and the UNICEF Procedure for Ethical Standards
in Research.
Evaluation and Data Collection and Analysis and UNICEF’s Evaluation Reporting Standards. In case
children or vulnerable populations are expected to be included under the data collection, ethical review
from an IRB will be required and will be responsibility of the evaluation team upon approval of the
inception report. Good practices not covered therein are also to be followed. Any sensitive issues or
concerns should be raised with the evaluation management team as soon as they are identified.
There are several limitations to the evaluation which can hinder the process, notably: (i) disaggregated
data may not be available at the local level, or the quality of available data may not be satisfactory; (ii)
uncertainty about the possibility to access communities at the time of data collection (iii) reliability of the
data collected online. The applicants should discuss the above or other potential limitations (including
limitations of proposed methodologies and sampling) in their proposal and further identify during the
inception phase. The limitations that could lead to changes in evaluation questions and scope of analysis
and mitigation measures should be clearly identified at the inception phase before initiation of data
collection. Specific scenarios are expected to be presented in the proposal.
82
A.4 Proposed Timeframe:
22 months including field data collection. An estimated budget has been allocated for this
evaluation. As reflected in Table 1, the evaluation has a timeline of four months, from November
2022 to March 2023. Adequate effort should be allocated to the evaluation to ensure timely
submission of all deliverables, approximately 17 weeks on the part of the evaluation team.

H.2 Responses by Tool and Question
H.2.1 Tool 2 – Centre Head/Facilitator KII
H.2.1.1 Question 1: Please tell me about your role and experience with the BBL
to date
The roles and experiences of centre heads and facilitators varied across regions. In smaller centres, or
where facilities were not provided, there was only one facilitator, but in larger centres there were
sometimes five or more facilitators / librarians.
In general centre heads saw their role as obtaining and organising books, teaching the children, telling
stories to children, encouraging children to read, helping them with their homework and organising
educational games and activities. Administrative tasks included writing reports and submitting data to
the responsible implementation partner.
In larger areas a centre head may be responsible for paying librarian salaries and scheduling librarians.
They were also responsible for ensuring participation in capacity development through training, fostering
collaboration with parents, the community and library committees, the Township Monitor and the
responsible Implementation Partner.
‘I am the head of the library and I have to meet with the parents of the children attending NFPE. I teach
the children systematically. I educate parents about the NFPE/EXCEL and try to teach them to ensure
the education of their children. Each parent asks for permission for their child to go to school. I have to
encourage families whose children are not in school that there is a need child to be educated and what
they are going to learn.239’
H.2.1.2 (Q2) Describe the type of support you and your centre have received
through the BBL?
Facilitators confirmed the support detailed in the PDs which included: financial support; books;
rehabilitation/renovation of library facilities/space; facilitator training; Facilitator fees (estimated at 90,000
Kyat a month240); Guide books; Teaching materials; pedagogical materials (Poetry books, story books,
ABC Cards, Home building cards, Short Course books); Painting materials; Stationary/writing materials
for children; Backpacks; Tablets/laptops; Guitars; Parental training; Story Books; Learning Toys; direct
funds (grant); Toiletries; handbags; Sound Box; Memory Sticks; Blankets; Teaching materials needed
for NFPE and EXCEL; Projector; Solar Batteries; Televisions; Waterproofing materials; White Boards
and marker pens; Inverters; Carpets and blankets; football; Learning Posters; Garbage bins; Power
Banks; Radio/soundboxes; Ribbons, Umbrellas; Compasses; Smartphones; Mats; Coconut Palms;
Rainwater tanks; Sexual educational papers; COVID protective equipment (eg: hand gels/facemasks);
Water bottles; Medical boxes
Facilitators reported being encouraged to draw upon locally available materials to help foster learning
and engagement such as making learning materials from Bamboo; tree growing.
H.2.1.3 (Q2/Q9) Has the training, support and resources you have received been
sufficient to help you to reach more children? Which have been most effective?
38 of 41 responses. 69% (27 of 38) respondents believed support had been adequate throughout the
BBL. 31% (12 of 38) noted aspects which were inadequate including a lack of books in proportion to the
239 Centre in Magway region under assistance provided by Succor Foundation
240 43 USD

number of children (5), inadequate subsidies/salaries for facilitators (4) and inadequate
materials/supplies/pencils (5). The books and materials were appreciated highly with several
respondents noting the inability of parents to otherwise give access to children owing to economic
hardship. In general respondents noted the books supplied had been greatly appreciated but often
inadequate for the number of children and that a constant stream of new books was required for children
who had read the books supplied. One respondent241 noted ‘children from other villages come to our
village because they do not have a school in their village. This has overwhelmed our capacity”. Another
noted242 “BBL provides adequate training and support resources. Children are interested in fostering a
community for reading. They ask always want new books.”. Another respondent noted that “we have
children from more than 300 homes resulting in many children which are divided into groups. But there
are not enough materials or facilitators so they have to wait patiently but they don't want to be too
patient”243.
H.2.1.4 (Q1) Do you think the BBL has helped you to ensure that children
attending your centre are receiving an education?
Almost all (36 of 38) respondents believed children were receiving some form of education through the
BBL. Respondents noted:
i. That during the COVID and the political crisis, the BBL program has been successful in helping
children continue their education.
ii. It has helped prepare children to return to education post twin crisis
iii. It helped those who have left school to develop a desire to return to school
iv. It was especially helpful for poor families.
v. Children have become more knowledgeable and improved their communication with Adults.
vi. It has improved the mood and wellbeing of children
vii. It has improved children’s capacity to read and write, appreciate books and has resulted in an
increased desire to read.
However respondents did note that some children didn’t want to learn or that some children did not want
to attend because they had no food/meals244. One respondent noted that the duration was only three (3)
months and, while very helpful, would be more effective if it could be developed into a long term
project245.
H.2.1.5 IV) (Q5) Do you think the BBL complements and fits with the community
activities to advocate home and community level learning among children? If so
how?
88% (36 of 41) of respondents believed that the BBL complimented or fit in with community activities to
advocate home and community level learning among children. However, in many cases participants
appeared to indicate that the BBL aligned with community goals of wanting children to learn.
Respondents noted:
i. EXCEL programme has helped the community by ensuring child behaviour has improved
outside of school without being political, and to help children behave morally.
ii. Reading has been helpful to children’s education and the literature is in harmony with the
community’s values.

xi. It has aligned with community objectives of supporting poor families and encouraging their
children to learn
H.2.1.6 V) (Q15) Do you think the BBL has contributed to reengagement of
children to learning at community level?
93% (38 of 41) believed that the BBL had contributed to reengagement of children to learning at
community level. 3 respondents were unsure.
i. Respondents noted that it contributed greatly to children’s learning, and capacity to study at
home.
ii. One respondent noted the difficulty of locating space for children including at home, in
monasteries, in temples and in children’s playgrounds246.
iii. When meals are served to children it encourages them to attend learning (2).
iv. The BBL has helped children enjoy learning through shared experiences, singing, games,
community assistance and activities.
v. The BBL engages children in community level learning but not all children may return to
school.
vi. It has helped children open up and communicate with each other about learning and school.
vii. I think the BBL contributes to re-engaging children in community-level learning, and I think it
helps them to read knowledgeable books and teach courses in the library247.
viii. The BBL contributes to children’s re-joining community-level learning, and contributes towards
children’s cognitive improvement, intellectual progress, and encourages participation of
parents to contribute to a children’s learning.
H.2.1.7 VI) (Q5) Are children returning to school (DFA MoE or CSO) and if so has
the BBL helped bridge the gap in learning during closure?
70% (29 of 41) of respondents believed that BBL helped bridge the gap in learning during closure,
particularly for reading and comprehension. 27% (11) were not sure and 1 response did not believe BBL
helped. 51% (21 of 41) respondents reported that children were going back to school.
Respondents believed BBL:
i. Contributed to the learning of a child and helped them with remedial and catchup school
lessons
ii. Helped OOSC to bridge schooling.
iii. In refugee villages there are no government schools.
iv. In some villages (1) children preferred to go to BBL rather than government schools.

121
v. In one village (1) some children can’t go to primary and middle school owing to the fees of
6,000 Myanmar Kyat required or because of family difficulties.
H.2.1.8 VII) (Q7) Have you had sufficient training, materials and support for
example to help address gender and inclusion related specific
objectives/activities?
37% (15 of 41) of respondents believed they had sufficient training, materials and support for example
to help address gender and inclusion related specific objectives/activities, 1 believed yes and the
remainder (25) were unsure.
One respondent noted that they received a gender-related course but that there was no other support248.
Others noted there was no direct support for gender (3). Several respondents noted that the BBL was
inherently inclusive and that all children were encouraged to attend learning. Most respondents did not
have a clear picture of what gender and inclusion was and how to address issues relating to gender and
inclusion ‘Boys and girls play differently. Boys make toys and girls paint and the games they play are
different.249’
Others had a clearer idea Adequate training and materials are provided to deal with gender-related goals
and activities, as well as health related medical supplies.
H.2.1.9 VIII) (Q8) Were supplies, funds and activities delivered in a timely
manner? If not, what were the bottlenecks encountered? Has this affected you in
any way?
63% (26 of 41) of respondents reported that supplies, funds and activities delivered in a timely manner.
Respondents reported the following issues with supply of supplies and funds:
i. Road traffic difficulties and roadblocks (3).
ii. Facilitator salaries being paid once every two months (3) resulting in hardship for the
facilitators
iii. Late delivery of teaching and pedagogical materials delayed teaching (2)
H.2.1.10 IX) (Q10) Were there examples where support, materials or training could
have been better?
Respondents listed many items support materials which could have been improved but didn’t offer any
substantial descriptions of how.
i. Parental training should be expanded to encourage parents to learn with their children and
support their child’s education.
ii. Increase the number of facilitators
iii. Learning online was problematic owing to poor internet connectivity and lack of visual.
iv. Increasing the support to ECCD
v. Improved books, more and new books and of broader areas (science), more teaching
materials and more application of technology in teaching and learning (computer courses)
vi. Improved facilities for teaching

Education, Domestic education, Industrial education)
xi. Playground
xii. Separate toilets
xiii. In one case there was no water at the school “It’s hard because there’s no water at school.
We need wells and small bricks. We need our own little water machines.”250
H.2.1.11 X) (Q13) Have you been asked for feedback from the implementation
partner? If so, how was this gathered and was it used?
25% (10 of 41) of respondents had not been consulted for feedback from the implementation partner
during the BBL while 78% (32 of 41) had been consulted but using a variety of mechanisms.
Mechanisms for consultation included:
i. Consultation with the IP formerly and informally
ii. Consultation between the centre head as a main point of contact, who liaised between the
community, education committee, teachers and parents and the IP.
iii. Consultation at the start of the BBL only as part of the education committee (2)
iv. Monthly reports updating on progress for the project and retained in a record book
1.1.1 XI) (Q19) Are you measuring learning outcome and graduation rates and has
the BBL positively influenced these?
No respondents were able to describe measuring learning outcomes. 73% (30 of 41) of respondents
believed the BBL had positively influenced learning and possibly graduation rates but 27% (11 of 41) did
not believe it had. In some cases BBL was the only chance children had to learn. As one respondent
noted ‘The BBL is one of the many options for children to learn in the city, but for children in the
countryside, the BBL is the only one supported by teachers, and by both parents and children and which
children can attend.’251
Evidence presented was largely anecdotal relating to behavioural changes and improved interest and
participation of children in learning. ‘Children have learnt what letters are, what colours are, they are
sharing with each other and talking about their lives and have learnt how to interact with adults. They
have developed a desire to go to school and improve their knowledge, to wash their hands and how to
eat cleanly.’252
For schools in Magway and Sagaing under Succor Foundation facilitators believed there was no positive
influence when reviewing the measurement of learning outcomes and trends in achievement.

H.2.1.12 XII) (Q13) Do you submit data to the implementation partner concerning
enrolment, attendance and learning outcomes? Have you received feedback on
this data (how is data captured/stored)?
22% (9 of 41) of respondents had recorded and submitted data to the implementation partner concerning
enrolment, attendance and learning outcomes. There was a lack of uniformity in the description of how
this was undertaken specific to each IP concerned. For centres under KBC there was a standardised
electronic process of recording and verifying data. Others took a structured approach to learning in
which progress of each student was recorded with suggestions on methods to improve learning specific
to each child. Some centres maintained information on enrolment, attendance, and learning results
which were submitted to the IP on a monthly basis253.
‘We have written daily reports of their progress, we have photographs, we have videos , we have
replayed the implementation side, and we congratulate them for their good work.’254
In other centres a process was not evident ‘I don’t know about enrolment, attendance, and learning
results, and I think it’s more relevant to school.’ And ‘we don’t know how to care for the data, so we don’t
keep or keep them.’
H.2.1.13 XIII) (Q14) Has the Community, natural community leaders and local
organizations and other stakeholders been involved in the BBL?
All (41 of 41) respondents noted the involvement of the community, community leaders and in some
cases local organisations. These included: Governors; committee members; religious leaders;
community leaders; neighbours; parents; librarians; volunteers from the community, students. ‘Since the
organization was to be formed, there have been discussions with neighbours, meetings, teachers, and
teachers making choices, and teachers educating parents once a month’.
Also involved in a few centres were: a relief team; health organization; social organization; village
governing body; Religious Organization; Educational Organization; the Chamber of Commerce; the
Youth Organization (Security); Village elders.
One respondent noted ‘If they do not participate directly, they are indirectly involved because their
children go to school. The congregation is composed of a committee, which includes the leaders of every
Department.255’
H.2.1.14 XIV) (Q16) What have been the biggest challenges you have faced
through the BBL?
Challenges encountered by respondents included:
i. Parents not wanting their children go to school for fear of COVID, lack of masks and hand gel.
Others want their children to work and remain uneducated
ii. Using webchat (zoom) to communicate with IP and to receive training.
iii. Transportation and inspection of goods under the political crisis and reviewing and confirming
supplies.
iv. Ensuring funds for students and financial difficulties for students (3)
v. Lack of Facilitators (teachers) and support for education
vi. Coping with anxiety from the conflict (PTSD) (2)
253 Succor Foundation
254 Centre in Magway region under assistance provided by World Vision
255 Centre in Shanghai (Eastern) region under assistance provided by MBC
124
vii. Delays in teachers’ salaries and inadequate teachers’ salaries (3)
viii. Children having less interest in education because schools were closed and losing interest in
study exacerbated by financial difficulties.
ix. Lack of food and school feeding
x. Convincing parents of the value of education and ensuring parents could bring their children to
the centre (on bicycle, on wet roads etc.)
H.2.1.15 XV) (Q21) Do you think the gains from the BBL will be sustained when
the programme ends? Which gains and why? What are the barriers and
opportunities?
90% (37 of 41) of responds believed the BBL would be sustainable with the remainder believing it either
would not be (3) or would be partly sustainable. Sustainability meant different things to different
respondents, with some viewing it as sustained learning and behaviour changes for the participants, and
others viewing it as the ability to continue to facilitate education after the conclusion of the BBL funding.
None reported having a sustainability plan.
Respondents noted that:
i. Children have progressed far in their education with the assistance of the BBL but without the
BBL there will be fewer teachers and therefore fewer children benefiting.
ii. Without the BBL parents will find it difficult to pay, especially poor families, but the community
and Education committee will try to sustain it. ‘Teachers have already given a lot to their
children, and they themselves have gained experience. Teacher’s subsidy will be paid by the
parents if UNICEF can’t continue,’
iii. Some libraries will continue to operate as sources of learning, but other aspects (teaching)
may struggle to be continued ‘We need to work hard to sustain it, reduce school wages,
reduce our subsidies, and stop if we can’t do it.’256
iv. Sustainability will be contingent upon the commitment and understanding of the community
and parents.
H.2.1.16 XVI) (Q23) What do you think needs to be done to ensure the gains from
the BBL are sustained at the programmes end?
Respondents noted the main shortfall would be finances for teacher salaries, new books, writing tools,
pedagogical materials, health medicines, hygiene, and running expenses (electricity/water). Locally
sourced funding was proposed to fill the deficit including: The library committee which collects money
from the village each month; church congregation donations; voluntary work of teachers; asking other
donors to contribute; contributions from parents.
One participant noted that ‘Teachers’ salaries will be reduced, and they may pursue other opportunities’
Only one respondent noted that the opening of schools would help reduce demand for the BBL.
H.2.1.17 XVII) (Q26/Q28) Do you think the BBL has addressed the needs of
vulnerable children? How?
98% (39 of 40) of respondents believed the BBL had helped address the needs of vulnerable children.
Most respondents believed the BBL achieved this by encouraging all children to participate including
256 Centre in Chin State region under assistance provided by KMSS
125
those of poor or disadvantaged backgrounds. The BBL has opened the door for all. There is no
discrimination’.
Others noted that support to parents to encourage children from disadvantaged backgrounds to attend
helped (2). One respondent argued that the BBL targeted poor families as these were the most likely
to have children who could not attend regular school.
H.2.1.18 XVII) a. Do you think the BBL has addressed the needs of Gender?
32% (13 of 41) of respondents believed the BBL addressed the needs of gender. Most believed there
was nothing specific about the BBL that addressed gender issues. Others believed it supported and
encouraged both girls and boys without discrimination. Only a few respondents were able to state
examples where gender had been addressed such as: though construction of separate toilets; different
extra curriculum activities for boys and girls.
H.2.1.19 XVII) b. Do you think the BBL has addressed the needs of Children with
Disabilities?
26% (10 of 39) of respondents believed the BBL addressed the needs of CWD which were almost all
schools under Succor Foundation in Magway and Sagaing. Facilitators at these centres noted facilities
for disabled children including toilets, ramps and handles and that the BBL provided opportunities for
CWD to participate in and receive education. One respondent noted that attending education through
EXCELpathway helped children with cognitive impairment.
H.2.1.20 XVII) c. Do you think the BBL has addressed the needs of Children from
Ethnic Backgrounds?
28% (10 of 36) of respondents believed the BBL has addressed the needs of Children from Ethnic
Backgrounds. 9 respondents stated that there were no children of ethnic backgrounds at their centres.
Others noted the centre did not discriminate and this made them welcoming to children of ethnic
background.
H.2.1.21 XVII) d. Do you think the BBL has addressed the needs of Children from
Children from Poor Families?
86% (31 of 36) of respondents believed the BBL has addressed the needs of Children from Poor Families
with many centres noting that the majority of children attending were from poor families. However,
several reported that there was no private arrangement to support children from poor families to attend
and that pro-poor support would help. In these cases, the community and facilitator assisted the child’s
family.
Respondents noted aspects of the BBL which enabled children from poor families to participate including:
Backpacks; books; parent orientation; supply of pedagogical materials; health care. The Non formal
primary and EXCEL pathways were noted by one participant as convenient for children cannot attend
school and must work or attend to the home.
‘I think it is most beneficial to provide more support for poor families, and I think it is because of the small
amount of school support that children have in attending school257’.

H.2.1.22 “XVIII. (Q27) Have representatives from women’s groups, OPDs, and
other groups for marginalized communities been involved in understanding the
needs and response of BBL (how)? (Relevance)”
66% (27 of 41) of respondents believed representatives from women’s groups, OPDs, and other groups
for marginalized communities been involved in understanding the needs and response of BBL.
Representatives helped if asked, were referenced if necessary, or involved indirectly, or had people on
the education committee, but were not involved formerly (6)
H.2.1.23 XIX) (Q29) What could the BBL be doing to better address the needs of
XIX) A. disadvantaged children

i. Provide more books and toys (3)
ii. Provide long term support including food, drinking water and shelter (3).
iii. Increase salaries of facilitators
iv. Train facilitators in how to manage disadvantaged children (2)
XIX) B. Girls
Respondents noted the BBL could:
i. Provide women’s toilets and bathrooms and more personal hygiene education and materials

machines are also needed. If possible, I would like to ask other organizations to seek help
even if they are not supported and supported.

the old school is raining during the rainy season, and the incidents are no longer bad, and
ceiling is damaged in high school.

so that children do not discriminate against poverty. And then the kids became well-educated,
and the tablet at school was very useful, so maybe there were about two more, because the
kids did tablets and assessment. Some children class outside the empty space, and if the sun
is hot, they feel hot. If you provide 50% for school, you’ll do your best to attend the remaining
50%. The school doesn’t have Printer & Computer, so it’s very necessary.

H.2.4 Tool 4 - : Parents, Caregivers, Community Members Of The
Parent Committee And Students FGD
H.2.4.1 i.) (Q1-Q4) Discuss how your life changed during Covid19 and after the
February 2021 military takeover and the challenges you faced in learning
Participants in FGD were asked to discuss how their life had changed during COVID-19 and after the
February 2021 military takeover and the challenges they faced in learning. All Participants noted
significant hardships encountered at the commencement of the programme. Most had faced challenges
before covid and the military takeover but these were often greatly exacerbated by the events occurring
since the commencement of the BBL. Some of the challenges are highlighted below:
i. Economic hardship which was exacerbated by inflation and scarcity of employment options for
parents
ii. Delays in children’s education resulting in reluctance to re-enter education and lost interest in
education or had entered the workforce
iii. Poor social habits as a result of a lack of schooling
iv. Difficulties travelling on the roads
v. Poor security and lack of safety traveling to school and the library
vi. Child labour
vii. Relocation
viii. Lack of food and shelter
Some significant quotes include:
i. There are seven members of the family, and they eat each day, and their mother’s health is
not very good, and the child works as a shopkeeper.
ii. The economy is difficult, travel is not easy, prices are high, and children’s education is
delayed.
iii. The family’s business collapsed, and without it, I had to work in the city, and my father worked
as a farmer, and my daughter could no longer go to school, grade-7, and she worked as a
hairdresser.
iv. There were five families, and my father died, and my mother and sister were working in
<location name removed>, leaving my daughter with an aunt, and she had to go to school
because her legs were bad.
v. The children’s lives changed quite a lot. Because they had not attended school for a long time,
they forgot how to read and write and they did not want to go to school. Because they have
forgotten, the children are embarrassed to go back to school.
vi. When I returned to school, I was disciplined, unable to concentrate on schoolwork, and felt that
I had lost my goal. I was happy when I concentrated on my schoolwork, and when I returned to
school, it was very difficult for me to get back to school.
vii. When I didn’t go to school, I forgot my education, I lost my goals, I lost my ambitions, I was late
for school/class. I was poor in education and I felt corrupted. When I returned to school,
writing and reading was very difficult, and my interest was diminished.
viii. I had difficulty finding food and employment. We struggle to cope without money, and
employment. Education was difficult, schooling was closed and education was delayed. We
141
did not know how to cope. Reading in the library has been helpful and helped me gain
knowledge, self-confidence and humour.
H.2.4.2 ii.) a.) Support to learning at home during COVID-19 / Conflict
Participants in FGD discussed the support to learning they received at home as a result of the BBL. All
participants were very grateful for the assistance of the BBL and believed it helped significantly to given
them the opportunity, and encourage them, to learn at home or the library.
Parents and Children were grateful for the libraries, facilities, books and pedagogical materials. They
were also grateful for the guidance and teaching provided by the facilitators. Children reported learning
how to read, but also how to socialise, empathise and engage with other children and adults. Most
Participants indicated that children learnt at the library with only a few learning at home.
i. Since the economy is down, children have to be expelled from school. They are now able to
study in the library for part of the time and seek knowledge.
ii. It’s a great help. I borrow a book and read it.
iii. We learn a lot about things that we don’t know, such as socializing, empathy, and so on.
iv. The opportunities and support provided by the BBL program are helpful to learning. I studied at
home, and if I didn’t know what to do, my parents and family would teach me.
v. I think we’re improving our education, we’re improving our knowledge. I learned about health,
social, and social issues, and I learned to open the library. I’m getting better. I’m able to read
and write. We have acquired knowledge and health and hygiene. I learned things I didn’t
know, and I relearnt what I knew before.
vi. Because of strong support for the EXCEL course, we are no longer worried about education,
and there are improvements in knowledge for our children. Children’s reading and study have
improved as a result of the opening of a library of children with weak study sections. – In the
teaching sectors, the interest in small comic cartoons has increased, and the progress of small
painting techniques has increased. EXCEL attended classes and received parental discipline.
During the covid19/conflict challenge, there are no assistance to teach at home.
vii. This program makes parents feel better, and it will be very beneficial for their children. It is
easy to learn about technology, increased reading, and improved knowledge. Children are
encouraged to spend time reading and studying in the library, helping their children to read and
write.
viii. During the COVID period, I taught them at home, and I asked them to read the publications,
but now I went to school during the military takeover period, and now I have to attend this
class, which is even more helpful.
H.2.4.3 ii.) b.) Support through teaching and mentoring
Participants in FGD were asked for opinions concerning support through teaching and mentoring.
Support to teaching and mentoring was dependent on location. Participants generally agreed that the
support had been very good and very helpful with many Participants indicating it had encouraged them
to read at home. EXCEL helped to develop children’s ability to form relationships, empathise,
communicate, build confidence, be polite, and to cope with stress and change. Facilitators engaged
children in reading, storytelling, games, group exercises, crafts such as painting, discussions and other
interactive methods at appropriate age levels.
Children reported improvements in literacy. They noted the reduced cost to parents for ensuring they
received support to learning. They reported positively on the EXCELlence of the teaching provided by
facilitators.
Some comments include:
142
i. We studied teenagers’ health knowledge, relationships, empathy, self-examination, and
hobbies, including reading, painting, and craftsmanship.
ii. We learn how to conduct lives, we know that there are reading circles, we like stories, we read
biographies, we rent books at home, and talk about what we have read.
iii. The teachers made sure that they understood, played games, performed practical exercises,
and performed small group tasks, as well as reading and reading exercises.
iv. We sometimes go to see the children learn, including greeting each other, socializing, playing,
and dancing, as well as telling stories about the children.
v. When I returned to school through the BBL, it was very beneficial in assisting my literacy and

parents’ expenses.
vi. It’s good that the BBL exists and teaches children. I learned to protect myself from bad
influences and was able to return to school. I learned about mental health issues, and I began
to have a good education. Teachers are good at teaching.
H.2.4.4 ii.) c.) Access to learning materials and resources
Participants in FGD were asked for opinions concerning support through access to learning materials
and resources. Participants generally agreed that provision of materials and resources had been very
helpful and accessible. Participants noted the provision of writing tools, backpacks, literature and games
which facilitated learning. Other supplies facilitated sports and group activities such as footballs, or child
wellbeing and care such as blankets and medical supplies (hand gel, masks, soap).
However, many also noted that the provision of supplies was inadequate in some areas. Several
Participants noted that access to learning materials was inadequate when compared to the number of
children. They also noted the need for more books, more English books and more writing materials.
Some comments include:
i. I had a variety of writing tools and backpacks, and I had to read a lot of literature and play
games.
ii. Getting printed books, reading other stories at school, making story telling from the teacher,
and learning English.
iii. The PLOC project has received a lot of help, and the supplies are inadequate, and only the
parents have to buy it back, but the cost of parents is very cheap, and I don’t even appreciate
the support.
iv. We received maker pens, colourful pencils, library facilities, and so on. However it the
supplies are inadequate for the number of children, but still beneficial.
v. Support is helpful to children and has been adequate. For children, books, pencils, wall
posters, backpacks, and other materials for learning were provided. For teachers, writing
materials, colourful paper, covers, files, printing books hand gel, masks and soap were
provided.
H.2.4.5 ii.) d.) Stipends to support cost of education (transportation, buying
uniforms, etc.)
Participants in FGD were asked for opinions concerning the provision of stipends to support cost of
education (transportation, buying uniforms, etc.). Almost all participants (57 FGD of 63 FGD) reported
that there was no provision of stipends to assist education. All support was provided through provision
of learning materials and resources, but these were considered sufficient.
143
H.2.4.6 ii.) e.) Participation in community activities and learning opportunities
outside of school

learning and what would be needed to further help or assist you to towards
achieving your learning goals?
Participants in FGD were asked to discuss the challenges or barriers you still face towards learning and
what would be needed to further help or assist you to towards achieving your learning goals.

H.2.6 Tool 5: Selected Case Studies – Case Study Form.
Parents/Guardians And Students
H.2.6.1 Overview
22 case studies were conducted across five regions being Bago, Chin State, Magway, Rakhine and
Sagaing. Participants had received BBL under five Implementation Partners being: KBC; KMSS; Succor
Foundation; World Vision; MBC; and BADA. The 22 (11 male, 11 female, GPI 1.00 included Center
head (1); Facilitator (2); Member Library (4); Students (15). 2 case studies identified as Ethnic Minorities
(2); 5 as CWD (5); and 8 from Poor families (8). All case studies expressed positive change as a result
of the BBL.
H.2.6.2 Case Study 1

lived in a remote village where she had difficulty attending school. She has had to leave her family to
ensure she obtains schooling. She had been away from her family for three years, and had
communicated little, having developed a fear of people and not participating in the congregation. With
the help of the BBL program under KBC, she improved her reading and writing and became
conscientious about learning. She gradually became involved in activities, made friends, improved her
communication and contributions towards the community. However, being away from her family is
difficult for her but she intends to stay and complete schooling.
H.2.6.3 Case Study 2
Person B is from Bago state. She is 8.6 years sold and studying in Grade 1. She is from the Karen
Ethnic Minority and her family has 4 Family Members. She does chores around the house and helps
her father and mother who is suffering from lung disease. She was ashamed of her parents’ poverty and
they suffered greatly since the military takeover began. She had not attended school and the villagers
assumed she had learning difficulties. However, since the start of the BBL conducted under KBC, she
has learnt to dress herself and stay clean, she enjoys playing with her friends and has grown in in
popularity within the library. She has grown more confident like other children and has learnt to
understands appreciate religion, time management and does her homework and schooling. She
attributes this change to the help of the the BBL program and the facilitators at the centre. Her goal is
to keep learning in school.
H.2.6.4 Case Study 3
Person C is a boy of 9 located in Bago state. He studies grade 1 and is of Karen ethnic minority. He
comes from a family of 5 and has previously worked with his father on a rubber plantation. However,
since the military takeover and COVID, his family has struggled to ensure food and shelter and he and
his siblings have been unable to attend school. He was unable to read and was behaving badly at home.
He was unwilling to communicate with others. Since attending the library under the BBL managed
through KBC, he has changed. He has developed a positive attitude, good behaviour, can communicate
well with others and has learnt to read and write. He now enjoys study and has returned to school. He
wants to continue learning and finish his schooling.
H.2.6.5 Case Study 4
Person D is a boy aged 14 located in Chin State. He is studying Grade 7 and identifies a CWD and as
an indigenous child although he still helps his family with home chores. His family is poor and has had
to flee from the conflict, leaving their village. As a result, his family received some assistance from the
church during school closure as a result of COVID and the military takeover.. He states that ‘during the
war, I had the opportunity to go to school under the BBL managed through KBC. I made friends at
school. I wanted to be an athlete and play football like my Idol Messi. Going to the PLOC also gives you
a lot of energy. I'm going to play football when I'm strong, I'm going to help my parents, and I'll share
what I’ve learned when I get back to our village.’
H.2.6.6 Case Study 5
Person E is the head of a library centre located in Magway and operated under the Succor Foundation.
He believes that changing circumstances in life should being good things to children who have learned.
‘The BBL has given knowledge to children from poor families and is having a big impact. There is a
disabled person in our school who is in the eighth grade of the BBL Project. They are attending the

By Succor Foundation. ‘When you always come to the library you experience positive change. You
develop a desire to read, to improve your reading. They make it easy for you to obtain school supplies.
Before BBL I didn’t have access to a library. I have developed the habit of reading which has increased
my knowledge. At school, you can be happy and safe to learn and be educated, and this improves your
desire to learn. When I finish I want to learn mechanical techniques, and I want to graduate from high
school. I would like the BBL to teach me a little vocational education.

He is studying the EXCEL programme at a centre assisted by Succor Foundation. Before the BBL is
reading habits were weak. His father found it difficult to get employment because of Covid and the
political situation. It was difficult to make money to get food and his health was bad as a result. There
was no medicine. He believes the BBL has improved his reading skills in Myanmar and English and has
improved his personal hygiene and health. His father noted that ‘Since the start of the BBL, I have not
been able to afford to buy writing equipment or school aids for my child but the BBL has provided these’.
One day he would like to be an engineer or a schoolteacher and wants to continue his education.

motorcycles. He wants to one day be a school teacher but feels he is still many years from obtaining his
goal. He wanted to start the BBL because he likes being around other children and gaining knowledge
and experience. His teacher initially called him in to study two or three times as long as I gave her food.
‘When I started attending I interrupted the rest of the children. But the teachers cared a lot about me,
and I was admired in public, so I was determined to continue, and I took other out of school children with
me to learn. I learned to speak politely, and I learned to be hygienic.’ He would like to continue Vocational
Education and become better at motorcycle repair.
H.2.6.22 Case Study 20
Person V is a female aged 15. She is from a family of five and her father is a farmer. She says that it is
difficult to make ends meet and as a result she has to help at home and sometimes earn money and this
led to hear failing her classes. Before attending BBL assisted by KMSS, she was afraid to go out in public
and afraid of being around people and didn’t associate with people very much. Since starting the BBL
she has learned to take the lead and is not afraid to go out in front of people and she knows how to deal
with people. She still finds it difficult to balance working to earn money with studying. ‘You have to fail
the study because you are following the money.’ Despite the challenges she is determined to continue
studying.

CWD was only partially addressed through the BBL. The environment was challenging owing to the
breakdown of social services during the twin crisis. For example, there were weak identification and
referral mechanisms for vulnerable children including CWD owing to a high demand and limited
services operating in each community.
There is significant scope to further address issues relating to GEDSI such as by addressing
issues of low male participation, strengthening identification and referral mechanisms for vulnerable
children, increasing the level of vocational education appropriate for each category of GEDSI, and
aligning the BBL with programmes or mechanisms providing pro poor support such as Social Policy
and Child Rights Monitoring (SPCRM) cash transfers to poor families. There is also capacity to
strengthen linkages with Ethnic Education Providers (EEC) in potential future iterations of the BBL.
