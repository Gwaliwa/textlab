Executive Summary
United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4.2 states that by 2030, all children
should have access to quality preschool education to ensure they are ready for primary
education.1 Preschool education improves long-term educational and life outcomes in
developing countries especially; school readiness programmes have the potential to provide
additional support to students who are otherwise socio-economically disadvantaged.2,3
Whilst access to education has substantially improved in recent years, Timor-Leste’s
preschool education sector is not prepared to achieve this SGD, or its own targets.
To help inform future planning for its preschool subsector, the Ministry of Education, Youth
and Sport (MoEYS) commissioned this independent evaluation of Timor-Leste’s preschool
education subsector. The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Timor-Leste engaged the
American Institutes for Research (AIR) to conduct the evaluation, with support from the
Universidade Nacional Timor Lorosa’e (UNTL) as an in-country partner for this work.
The evaluation focused on Timor-Leste’s preschool education subsector and covered years
2012–2020 to align with the launch of the Policy Framework for Preschool Education. It
fulfilled the three main objectives: (1) Develop a theory of change to capture the pathways
towards increasing equitable access to quality preschool education in Timor-Leste;
(2) Assess the relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability of the
preschool education policy and programmes in Timor-Leste; and (3) Identify lessons learned
and make recommendations useable by the government and its key partners to inform
decision-making on policy and programme design and implementation of the preschool
subsector.
Methodology
This thematic evaluation consisted of a single round of data collection, with a desk review of
relevant documentation and education management information system (EMIS) data, plus
36 key informant interviews with government stakeholders at the national and municipal
levels, international organisations such as UNICEF and the World Bank, teacher training
institutions, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and preschool programme providers.
Team members from UNTL also conducted a focus group discussion with Timor-Leste’s Early
Childhood Development (ECD) Working Group.

Key Findings
In this section, we
present key findings
related to each of the
evaluation questions.
Presence of
comprehensive and
evidence-based policies
and plans for the
delivery of high-quality
preschool education.
Taken together, Timor-
©UNICEF / BBenevides
Leste’s preschool
policies and plans address the key areas required for high-quality preschool education
systems. However, plans are fragmented across documents and are mostly at a high level.
There are substantial gaps in the availability of relevant data, making it very challenging for
Timor-Leste stakeholders to engage in evidence-based planning.
Extent to which actors in Timor-Leste’s preschool education sector collaborate and
coordinate with one another and with actors in other sectors to meet children’s holistic
needs. There are a variety of actors in the preschool subsector, but there is no coherent
national plan that integrates Timor-Leste’s efforts into a larger framework. The main
collaboration mechanism for preschool education at the national level was the ECD Working
Group (which was established to review multisectoral ECD policy more broadly, including
preschool education). However, the group’s work stalled due to staff turnover and the
pandemic. At the municipal level, there are no systematic mechanisms of coordination in
place amongst municipal education authorities, partners and the MoEYS.
Presence of adequate governance and accountability structures and strategies. Timor-
Leste has clear lines of authority and explicitly defined roles and responsibilities for the
subsector. National-level stakeholders indicated a need for more effective collaboration on
financing and implementation amongst government actors and between the government
and other organisations. Municipalities have primary responsibility for preschool financing
and implementation, and they would like improved guidance on preschool standards.
Budgeting and financing for the provision of cost-effective preschool education. As a
portion of gross domestic product (GDP), the budget allocated to preschool is less than one
tenth the recommended level (of 1 per cent of GDP). Within the education sector budget,
the subsector receives one third or less of the recommended proportion. Timor-Leste
appears to start with a budget allocation for preschool in the education sector plan, then
determines how to use it best, rather than basing the budget on a comprehensive and long-
2 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
range subsector plan with corresponding identification of what resources are required. On
the positive side, the MoEYS and partner organisations communicate well regarding how
partners can help provide resources for the subsector.
Preparation to implement the preschool education strategy in a timely manner. A strength
of Timor-Leste’s approach to preschool subsector planning is its strong alignment with the
broader education sector. There are short- and long-term targets for the expansion of
preschool education, but stakeholders say they are unrealistic. Subsector plans are not fully
articulated with a scope and sequence of costed activities to be carried out over time
(including roles of different actors across the subsector to carry out the plan).
Monitoring and quality assurance systems for data-driven decision-making and continuous
quality improvement. Timor-Leste’s school standards address elements that apply to
preschool classes but that are not fully aligned with developmentally appropriate practice.
There are insufficient school inspectors, and programmes lack guidance on how to work
towards meeting standards. Furthermore, stakeholders use the EMIS but consistently noted
issues of timeliness and comprehensiveness of the data – which negatively affected its utility.
Existence of a sufficient and well-trained preschool education workforce. Timor-Leste is
following best practices by considering preschool teachers as part of the educator
workforce. However, government hiring of preschool educators is not a priority, and there is
a severe lack of qualified teachers and teacher trainers. Most preschool teachers lack formal
training, although there are some professional development opportunities.
Families and community engagement. Timor-Leste has several policy directives regarding
family and community engagement in schools, but some stakeholders lacked information
about how to implement these policies. Family and community engagement was almost
entirely focused on what families and communities could provide for schools (money,
labour, etc). Stakeholders seemed unaware that preschool programmes should also engage
in strengths-based planning and partnership with families and communities.
Participation in quality preschool education programming. Timor-Leste made progress in
the development and expansion of preschool, but with a 27 per cent gross enrolment rate
(GER) as of 2020,4 the country is not on track to attain SDG 4.2 by 2030, nor is it likely to
reach its own targets of 50 per cent enrolment by 2024 or 80 per cent enrolment by 2030.
On the positive side, boys and girls participate equally in preschool programming.
Support for children’s successful transitions into Grade 1. Stakeholders agreed that in
principle, preschool programming should align with the expectations for students entering
Grade 1, but in reality, there is no deliberate alignment. There was inconsistent use of

3 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
Grade 1 data to help stakeholders determine whether preschool education was preparing
children well for basic school.
Promotion of equity. Timor-Leste has strategies for the professionalisation of the preschool
workforce (which primarily serves children from lower-resource communities), but they are
not used consistently. Lack of designated funding is a significant constraint. The country has
a plan to incentivise qualified teachers to work outside the capital, which can help improve
equity in access to professional teachers. And education system monitoring addresses
gender and disability, plus non-discrimination, but not linguistic diversity. Finally, there are
almost no training opportunities around education for children with disabilities, leaving
them without access to educators who know how to meet their needs.
Preparation to provide long-term and scaled-up, quality preschool education
programming. The country’s short- and long-term plans for the development and provision
of preschool are viewed as unrealistic by stakeholders. Stakeholders reported that there
were insufficient data on the subsector to make accurate cost projections, and they strongly
believed that preschool education received inadequate financing to achieve its goals.
Conclusions
The findings from this evaluation lead to the following conclusions:
The enabling environment. Timor-Leste’s preschool system exists as a subsector within the
larger education sector – a best practice. Preschool stakeholders felt a sense of ownership
towards the subsector and understood their respective roles. However, strong coordination
was lacking between the different actors, making their efforts less efficient.
The preschool subsector is severely underfunded by global standards, in relation to both the
country’s GDP and in terms of how much of the overall education sector budget goes to the
preschool subsector.
Planning and budgeting. There are multiple actors working on access and quality of
preschool education in Timor-Leste, but no coherent plan specifies step by step how the
country will achieve its goals for preschool. It is a strength of Timor-Leste’s preschool
subsector that it is already included in the national EMIS. However, EMIS data were often
not timely or accurate, and stakeholders were not sure how to effectively use the EMIS data
that were available. In addition, EMIS does not capture data from community preschools or
other alternative or internationally funded programs. Stakeholders also lacked sufficient
data to make accurate cost projections for preschool programming.
Workforce. Timor-Leste is following best practices by identifying preschool teachers as part
of its basic education workforce. Yet, the country’s teaching standards have not been
adapted for the preschool level. In addition, there is a severe shortage of qualified preschool
teachers. The country does have strategies to build the capacity of its untrained preschool
4 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
workforce, but implementation of these strategies is hampered by budgetary constraints
and insufficient availability of teacher trainers.
Quality assurance. A strength of Timor-Leste’s preschool system is its inclusion of quality
assurance monitoring as part of MoEYS education sector monitoring. The monitoring
framework formally addresses gender and disability, plus non-discrimination, but is not
explicit about linguistic diversity. Monitoring tools capture key elements of a safe and
supportive learning environment for any grade level. However, some indicators are not
appropriate for the preschool level. Timor-Leste has too few school inspectors, and
monitoring visits can be sporadic. Municipalities and programmes would like improved
guidance on how to meet standards.
Curriculum. Timor-Leste has a developmentally appropriate preschool curriculum. However,
preschool educators often did not have the teaching and learning materials they needed,
and there was also confusion regarding the use of first-language instruction.
Family and community engagement. Timor-Leste has policy directives around family
engagement, but educators were unclear how to put them into practice. Family and
community engagement was heavily focused on getting families and communities to
contribute funds or labour to the preschool class. However, there was a lack of awareness
on the importance of engagement with communities as partners to co-develop plans that
best meet the needs of the children, or strengths-based engagement with families to plan
how to meet individual children’s holistic needs. This type of family and community
engagement may have been happening in some preschool programmes but was not part of
business as usual.
Recommendations
This evaluation yielded 12 recommendations, with Recommendations 1 and 2 having the
highest priority:
1. Develop a comprehensive national plan for preschool improvement and expansion
toward progressive universalisation. This plan should cover all key aspects of the
preschool system; indicate short-, medium- and long-term targets based on a realistic
assessment of what can be accomplished; define step by step how the country will move
towards these targets (with costed activities); and specify the roles and responsibilities
of all actors in the subsector towards carrying out those steps.
2. Improve financing of the subsector. Carrying out Recommendation 1 can help the
MoEYS and partners project what level of funding will be needed and when, identify
activities to prioritise with limited resources, advocate for funding from donors and
create efficiencies in the system.
3. Improve the timeliness and quality of EMIS data to facilitate planning and oversight.
Expand the EMIS to comprehensively cover public and private preschool programming.
5 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
4. Determine how to simultaneously build the skills of the largely untrained preschool
workforce it has now, whilst working towards increasing the size of its workforce overall,
especially the availability of qualified professional teachers. The country needs a
national teacher recruitment and training strategy. Also, identify and scale the most
effective models for training unqualified/volunteer staff.
5. Determine how best to build upon the diversity of preschool delivery models in use in
Timor-Leste, so as to maximise efficient coverage and meet the needs of different types
of communities.
6. Timor-Leste’s standards for basic schools should have a tailored module for the
preschool class that reflects developmentally appropriate practice.
7. Preschool programmes need step-by-step guidance on how to work towards meeting
standards. It is also important that this guidance provides low-cost and feasible options
where achieving some standards may seem costly or out of reach.
8. ECD working groups should be established at the municipal level, to foster coordination
within the subsector as well as promote cross-sector collaboration towards promoting
child and family wellbeing.
9. There should be a legal requirement for all preschool programming and activities to be
registered with and approved by the national and/or municipal government. The
government needs to have the authority over preschool programming, including the
activities of NGOs working in the subsector.
10. Provide preschool programmes with guidance regarding the use of first-language
instruction, and work to ensure that all preschool programmes have the basic materials
they need to carry out the preschool curriculum.
11. Broaden understanding of family and community engagement to include strengths-
based partnership with shared responsibility for meeting children’s needs.
12. Complete a situational analysis of education for children with disabilities. The study
should consider both the needs of the children and how educators and programmes can
best be prepared to serve these children.

1. Background and Context
Whilst access to education has substantially improved in recent years, Timor-Leste’s
education sector remains overwhelmed with issues such as poor learning outcomes, high
repetition rates and high dropout rates. With a growing number of public and private
schools, primary school enrolment rates have improved significantly, with a net enrolment
rate (NER) of 82 per cent in 2020, compared to 64 per cent in 2005.5 Yet a 2017 Early Grade
Reading Assessment (EGRA) covering 6,326 students in 128 schools found that 16 per cent
of Grade 1 students could not identify any letters, and 76 per cent scored a zero in reading
comprehension.6 Grade repetition is also a problem, particularly for children who do not
begin school at the officially designated age of 6. For instance, whilst 25 per cent of children
repeat the first grade, 29 per cent of children who start Grade 1 at age 5 repeat the grade,
compared to 23 per cent of children who start at the age of 6.7 The higher repetition rates
for younger children signal a lack of access to early learning opportunities. Preschool
enrolment is low, with 25 per cent of children enrolled (NER) as of 2020.8 Additionally, the
Timor-Leste Out-of-School Children Study9 found that 64 per cent of five-year-old children
were attending basic (primary) education instead of preschool.
Seventy-one per cent of the population resides in rural areas, yet the preschool education
supply is lowest in these regions.10 Additionally, half of school-aged children suffer from
stunting, which, coupled with chronic malnutrition, has a negative impact on children’s
cognitive development.11
Poor WASH infrastructure in homes and schools and related health problems may also have
an impact on school attendance and progression. The government’s 2016 guidelines for
WASH in schools noted that nearly all Timorese basic schools face challenges in the
provision of WASH and that most schools lacked reliable access to water and/or functioning
toilets.12 Awareness and uptake of appropriate hygiene practices is low. In rural areas, for
instance, only 2 per cent of the population reported washing their hands with soap after

using the bathroom or changing a baby’s diaper. In addition, a 2016 research report
suggests that 46 per cent of caregivers in Timor-Leste believe that physical punishment is
appropriate for children; corporal punishment in school has been associated with a series of
negative education outcomes, including poor academic performance, low class participation
and school dropout.13 Finally, over 35 languages are spoken as first languages in Timor-
Leste,14 and families who do not speak Tetum or Portuguese may have difficulties accessing
services.
United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4.2 states that by 2030, all children
should have access to quality preschool education to ensure they are ready for primary
education.15 Evidence shows that preschool education improves long-term learning outcomes
and lowers dropout rates. Preschool education programmes aim to increase students’
emotional, social and mental preparation to succeed in school.16 Children who enter primary
school after a successful preschool education programme demonstrate higher test score
performance, class participation and effort, and high school completion rates.17,18 In
developing countries especially, school readiness programmes have the potential to provide
additional support to students who are otherwise socio-economically disadvantaged.19,20 In a
review of World Bank projects, only early stimulation programmes had positive, long-term
effects in all six evaluated categories of physical development, cognitive development,
language development, socio-emotional development, schooling outcomes and employment
outcomes.21 In Indonesia, for example, the Early Childhood Education and Development
Project reduced educational achievement gaps between children from high- and low-income
families in comparison with results in non-project villages.22

©UNICEF / BBenevides
In recent years, preschool education has benefited from renewed institutional support from
the government of Timor-Leste and partners. For instance, the National Education Strategic
Plan (NESP) 2011–2030 identifies preschool as a priority for education and sets a target of
achieving a preschool NER of 50 per cent for three- to five-year-old children by 2015 and
100 per cent by 2030.23
Additionally, the government is currently developing a multisectoral National Policy for ECD
that includes a priority for preschool education and investing in the construction,
rehabilitation and accreditation of preschools. One key element of the current strategy is
implementation of the Halimar, Aprende no Descobre Susesu (HANDS) programme by New
Zealand Aid in close collaboration with the government. HANDS is intended to increase
access to preschool programming, with a special focus on language and pre-reading skills.
Furthermore, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has been supporting community
preschools in the Ermera and Viqueque municipalities since 2017, which together represent
about 3 per cent of preschool enrolment in the country. A 2019 midterm review of HANDS
identified bottlenecks such as fragmented management of preschool education, insufficient
funding, and lack of quality standards and oversight.24 At this juncture, it is important to
gain a holistic picture of the subsector at a national level – including the identification of
opportunities to strengthen the system efficiently.

9 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
The government of Timor-Leste has prioritised the development of and commissioned an
evaluation of its preschool education subsector, managed by UNICEF Timor-Leste. The
American Institutes for Research (AIR) has been contracted to conduct this national-level
evaluation and will provide timely and comprehensive information to the government and
other preschool education stakeholders to help guide this process. This report provides an
overview of the evaluation, presents the findings for each of the evaluation questions and
offers recommendations for stakeholders in Timor-Leste’s preschool education system.
2. Object of the Evaluation
The object of this evaluation was Timor-Leste’s preschool education system at the national
level. The primary focus was on the government’s development and implementation of a
comprehensive preschool education system during the 2012–2020 timeframe. However,
there are several other entities currently involved in the provision of technical assistance
and/or direct services in the preschool education subsector, such as UNICEF, New Zealand Aid
and NGOs. As Timor-Leste develops its own national preschool education subsector and
capacity, these other entities would be expected to step back from the key roles they play in
filling gaps in the subsector at this time. Therefore, this

of change for Timor-Leste’s preschool education subsector
(see Figure 1). This draft theory of change was finalised
during a workshop held with the ERG and the MoEYS on 11 August 2021. This theory of
change was reviewed at the conclusion of data collection and refined as needed during the
validation workshop for the evaluation findings and recommendations.
The theory of change includes inputs in the form of government leadership, policies and
legislation, public demand, and financing. The subsector then requires planning and
budgeting, workforce development, curriculum development, family and community
engagement, and a system of quality assurance and/or accreditation. If these activities are
carried out successfully, the outputs would be system capacity (that is, the ability to serve all
children in Timor-Leste, or all children whose families wish to enrol them in a preschool), a
workforce of qualified preschool staff, well-resourced preschool programmes, and families
and communities that promote ECD, including preschool education. If these outputs occur,
then children across Timor-Leste will have access to quality preschool education
environments and will experience support for their learning and development at home and in
10 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
the community. If these outcomes are realised, Timor-Leste will achieve improved (and
sufficient) early learning and school readiness for its children.
The evaluation explored inputs, activities, and outputs. Given the resources available for this
evaluation, it did not include direct assessment of the outcomes or impacts. The underlying
values were reflected in the framing of interview questions for participants.
The theory of change also displays the key role that nurturing care (as operationalised in the
Nurturing Care Framework [NCF]25) plays in the development of supportive environments
for young children. The NCF addresses the foundational supports that all young children
need to survive and thrive: good health, adequate nutrition, responsive caregiving, security
and safety, and opportunities for early learning.26 Preschool education is an essential source
of opportunities for early learning, but all these elements must come together (including
early learning outside of preschool education as well) for optimal development.

Figure 1. Theory of Change
12 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
The theory of change also rests upon 10 values that permeate the preschool subsector:
• Equity: ensuring that all children have access to quality preschool education, with a special
focus on meeting the needs of the most marginalised
• Collaboration and integration: stakeholders working together within the preschool
education subsector and across sectors to provide holistic support for children’s healthy
development
• Empowerment: making sure all relevant stakeholders have a voice, including those who are
typically marginalised
• Inclusion: providing preschool education for all children, regardless of disability or family
background
• Professionalisation: developing and supporting the preschool education workforce as
professional educators, equal to educators serving older children
• Accountability: defining lines of responsibility across the elements of the preschool system
and ensuring that those responsible feel ownership and are held to account
• Use of data: systematically using evidence for accountability and decision-making
• Efficiency: using available resources wisely to achieve desired outcomes whilst minimising
waste
• Gender equality: ensuring that boys and girls have equal access to quality preschool
education, men and women are both welcome in the preschool education workforce, and
both mothers and fathers are viewed as key partners in preschool education
• Sustainability: planning how the preschool education system will grow and be sustained in
the future
There are multiple underlying preconditions, assumptions and risks associated with this theory
of change. Many of these apply to government partners who are filling gaps in preschool
provision (and implementing the theory of change, at least in part).
The preconditions are:
1. Leadership has an interest in developing its preschool education sector.
2. Leadership is motivated to provide quality preschool education (not just access).
3. Policies are put into effect.
4. The government has accountability to stakeholders for the delivery of preschool education.
13 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
5. Personnel overseeing preschool education programming understand quality preschool
education.
6. Any curriculum promoted or already in use is based on good practices in preschool
education pedagogy.
7. There are positive and constructive relationships between preschool education leadership
and other preschool education personnel.
The underlying assumptions are:
1. Stakeholders value the promotion of equity.
2. Stakeholders believe in the empowerment of families and communities.
3. Stakeholders are willing to coordinate within the preschool education sector.
4. Parents and communities are, or would be receptive to, messages about preschool
education.
5. Parents will send children to quality preschool education programming if it is available.
6. Leadership is willing to engage in evidence-based and data-driven decision-making.
7. It is possible to implement quality standards for preschool education that will drive quality
improvement yet not overwhelm programmes.
The risks are:
1. Government instability leads to frequent personnel changes.
2. Available funding for preschool education is significantly below what is required.
3. Competing national and/or municipal priorities divert resources from preschool education.
4. Emergencies (natural disasters, health emergencies, etc) disrupt operation of the preschool
education system.
5. There is an insufficient preschool education workforce (due to factors such as lack of
interest in the job, lack of educated workers, low wages, etc).
6. Data that are collected (on implementation, outcomes, impacts) are not used – thus
wasting resources and the opportunity to use data for planning, budgeting and
accountability.

3. Purpose, Objectives and Scope
This evaluation was commissioned by the MoEYS, with support from UNICEF Timor-Leste, to
fulfil the following purpose, objectives and scope.
3.1. Purpose
As stated in the terms of reference (ToR), the purpose of this formative, participatory,
utilisation-focused evaluation was to generate evidence and learning from the implementation
and results of preschool education initiatives in Timor-Leste (see Annex A). The findings
produced through the evaluation inform strategic decision-making on preschool education
design and programming in the country. The government of Timor-Leste also benefits from the
evidence produced through this evaluation to improve the capacity and quality of preschool
education. The evaluation informs stakeholders in Timor-Leste how best to leverage the
preschool education framework to drive improvements in the country’s preschool education
policies, funding, systems and delivery platforms.
Recognising the need for improvement in the quality and coverage of preschool education in
the country, the government of Timor-Leste has taken different steps to strengthen the
preschool subsector. These include the NESP 2011–2030,27 which identifies preschool as a
priority for education, and the development of a National Policy for ECD, amongst others.
Therefore, the MoEYS desired to acquire ample evidence on the existing system. This
evaluation therefore aimed to identify the supply-side and demand-side bottlenecks and
challenges and to provide recommendations that will inform decision-making on policies,
programme design and implementation. The information also guides system expansion by
providing effective approaches for future scaling up of preschool education programmes.
Uses for the evaluation and intended audiences
As specified in the ToR, the main purpose of the evaluation was to generate evidence to inform
the discussions and plans by Timor-Leste’s MoEYS and institutional stakeholders to create an
enabling environment for accessible, quality and sustainable opportunities for preschool
education in Timor-Leste. The evaluation built on the findings and lessons from the UNICEF-
supported longitudinal study carried out by AIR that studied the effects of preschool education
with parenting education support. The MoEYS, municipal and local authorities, and other
development partners involved in the provision of preschool education are the target audience
and main users of the evaluation. Other users include other United Nations agencies,

Leste, 2011.
15 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
development partners, NGOs, community service organisations, faith-based organisations and
the private sector.
3.2. Objectives of the Evaluation
The evaluation fulfilled the three main objectives stated in the ToR:
• Develop a theory of change to capture the pathways towards increasing equitable access to
quality preschool education in Timor-Leste. Develop the ToC based on the review of the
literature on childhood education programming and based on contributions from key
stakeholders (including the ERG). The theory of change will provide a theoretical framework
of activities, outputs and outcomes that will form the basis for evaluating the overall
programme of preschool education activities in Timor-Leste.
• Assess the relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability of the
preschool education policy and programmes in Timor-Leste.
• Identify lessons learned and make recommendations usable by the government of Timor-
Leste and its key partners to inform decision-making on policy and programme design and
implementation of the preschool subsector and on early childhood development, including
cross-sectoral linkages in the country.
3.3. Scope of the Evaluation
The evaluation focused on preschool education programming across Timor-Leste from 2012 to
2020.
3.3.1. Thematic scope
The thematic scope of the evaluation covered the assessment of approaches to implementing
preschool education in Timor-Leste. This involves the extent to which the programmes increased
equitable access to preschool opportunities. The evaluation covered preschool education
programming offered by the diversity of providers in Timor-Leste, including the government, the
Church, UNICEF-supported community preschools and others. The evaluation also built on
findings and lessons from previous studies in Timor-Leste (including the UNICEF-supported study
on school readiness and parental support), guided by the Global Partnership for Education’s
Better Early Learning and Development at Scale framework.28 Doing so helped the evaluators
examine the strategies and approaches for strengthening the preschool education system to
ensure quality, equitable and sustainable services. Note that this evaluation did not involve an
impact evaluation, nor a direct observation of preschool education quality or learning outcomes.

2022.
16 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
Based on the various sources of data proposed for use in the evaluation, the data analysts
triangulated findings and assessed the extent to which preschool education programmes were
supported by other relevant sectors such as health, nutrition and social protection.
3.3.2. Geographic Scope
This evaluation was at the national level, with two municipalities (Ainaro and Lautem) serving
as sites for more in-depth data collection, plus (less in-depth) municipality-level data collection
in Baucau, Bobonaro, Viqueque and Oecusse. These municipalities provided an overview of the
preschool education landscape in Timor-Leste to help answer the evaluation questions, but the
report of findings does not include municipality-specific case studies. (See Section 4.4 for more
information about the sampling decisions.)
3.3.3. Chronological Scope
This evaluation covered the time frame from 2012 to 2020. The starting date of 2012 coincided
with the release of Timor-Leste’s 2012 Policy Framework for Preschool Education.
4. Methodology
The methodology for this
evaluation was aligned with
the requirements of the ToR
(see Annex A). This section

constraints and limitations.
4.1. Evaluation Criteria
The evaluation criteria are aligned with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee criteria, addressing relevance,
coherence, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability. These criteria apply to this evaluation in
the following ways:
17 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
• Relevance. The government of Timor-Leste must have comprehensive and evidence-based
policies and plans for the delivery of high-quality preschool education.
• Coherence. Government and non-governmental actors in Timor-Leste’s preschool subsector
must collaborate and coordinate with one another to effectively meet young children’s
holistic needs at scale.
• Effectiveness. Timor-Leste’s preschool system must have (1) adequate governance and
accountability structures and strategies for the provision of quality preschool education;
(2) a sufficient and well-trained preschool education workforce; (3) family and community
engagement as active partners in the preschool education sector and in promoting young
children’s learning; (4) young children’s access to and participation in preschool education
programming; (5) supports for children’s successful transitions into Grade 1; and (6) a focus
on the promotion of equity, including reaching the most marginalised; empowerment of
women and girls; respect for linguistic diversity; and inclusion of people with disabilities.
• Efficiency. Timor-Leste must have an adequate budget and financing mechanisms for the
provision of cost-effective preschool education (even if part of the budget and financing
comes from non-governmental sources). The country must also have effective monitoring
and quality assurance systems in place for data-driven decision-making and continuous
quality improvement.
• Sustainability. Timor-Leste must be prepared to provide long-term and scaled-up, quality
preschool education programming nationally. In addition, it is important for the country to
be aware of and leverage opportunities to strengthen its preschool education system.
There are no defined national or international standards for what constitutes an effective
preschool system. However, there is a broader understanding in the field regarding what is
required for countries to have a well-functioning preschool subsector. These informal criteria
are captured in the UNICEF Preschool Subsector Analysis Tool.29 This tool provided guidance for
the evaluation criteria, framework and indicators used here – although the tool was not used in
its entirety.
4.2. Evaluation Framework
The evaluation framework for this project was based on the ToR and was developed in
collaboration with the ERG. Fourteen evaluation questions were finalised based on a workshop
that included the ERG as well as representatives from the MoEYS.30 These questions are
founded on a rights-based understanding of development, particularly the right to education
29 UNICEF, ‘Preschool sub-sector analysis tool’, <https://www.ece-accelerator.org/toolkit/section-2/tool-2-2/subsector-analysis-
tool> accessed 1 February 2022.
30 Workshop held August 11, 2021.
18 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
and a commitment to equity for women and girls, linguistic minorities and children with
disabilities. The questions furthermore align with the strategy to strengthen local capacity and
systems found within the Convention on the Rights of the Child/Core Commitments for
Children.
The evaluation questions were as follows31:
1. To what extent does the government of Timor-Leste have comprehensive and evidence-
based policies and plans for the delivery of high-quality preschool education? (relevance)
2. To what extent do actors in Timor-Leste’s preschool education sector collaborate and
coordinate with one another and with actors in other sectors to meet children’s holistic
needs? (coherence)
3. To what extent does Timor-Leste have adequate governance and accountability structures
and strategies for the provision of quality preschool education? (effectiveness)
4. To what extent does Timor-Leste have a sufficient and well-trained preschool education
workforce? (effectiveness)
5. To what extent are families and communities engaged as active partners in the preschool
education sector and in promoting young children’s learning? (effectiveness)
6. To what extent do children in Timor-Leste have access to and participate in quality
preschool education programming? (effectiveness)
7. How and to what extent does Timor-Leste support children’s successful transitions into
Grade 1? (effectiveness)
8. To what extent does the preschool education system promote equity, including reaching
the most marginalised; empowerment of women and girls; respect for linguistic diversity;
and inclusion of people with disabilities? (effectiveness)
9. To what extent does Timor-Leste have adequate budget and financing mechanisms for the
provision of cost-effective preschool education? (efficiency)
10. To what extent is Timor-Leste prepared to implement its preschool education strategy in a
timely manner? (efficiency)
11. To what extent does Timor-Leste have monitoring and quality assurance systems in place
for data-driven decision-making and continuous quality improvement? (efficiency)
31 There was initially a thirteenth evaluation question regarding opportunities to strengthen the preschool education system,
and what would it take to leverage those opportunities. The evaluation team did not have data that directly answered that
question, but rather used that question to guide the discussion in the conclusions and recommendations sections.
19 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
12. To what extent is Timor-Leste prepared to provide long-term and scaled-up, quality
preschool education programming nationally? (sustainability)
Based on these questions, the team developed an evaluation matrix that specifies the criteria,
indicators, sources of information and data collection techniques used to answer these
evaluation questions (see Annex B).
4.3 Evaluation Design and Methods
This thematic evaluation consisted of a single round of data collection across a variety of
stakeholders and other information sources that allowed the team to answer the evaluation
questions (see Figure 2). Researchers from AIR and UNTL gathered qualitative data and existing
documents, as well as quantitative data from secondary sources such as data from the EMIS.
Where possible, analysts triangulated findings across sources.
This section outlines the specific components of the approach, along with the rationale for
selecting them in order to achieve the evaluation’s purpose, objectives and scope. This section
also discusses the methods and data collection tools used.
Figure 2. Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste: Summary of
Approach
4.3.1. Desk review
This evaluation included a desk review to collect existing documents and secondary data
pertaining to the chronological scope of the evaluation. The existing documents enabled the
data analysts to understand the policies, plans, budgets, monitoring mechanisms and other
20 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
systems in place, whilst the secondary data enabled team members to utilise more extensive
data beyond the scope of this study in a cost-effective way.
The UNTL data collection team began the desk review process during the inception period with
the support and guidance of AIR. Using a list of criteria and suggested documents for which to
search, the UNTL team combed through resources to find available information regarding the
preschool education sector for 2012 to 2020. These documents included national strategic
plans for education, budgets, school inspection manuals, enrolment data, and project and
activity reports in English, Tetum or Portuguese (see Annex C). After compiling these sources,
the team matched available information to indicators in the evaluation matrix (see Annex B).
During the subsequent project phases, the evaluation team continued this process and sought
out additional sources from interview participants.
4.3.2. Primary data collection
The evaluation consisted of key informant interviews (KIIs) with stakeholders at the national and
municipal levels (see Annex E). This qualitative data collection method enabled the evaluators to
reach a set of respondents who could provide rich information regarding topics such as current
strategies, objectives and policies for preschool education; the extent to which communities,
families and personnel are aware of the importance of preschool education; the investment of
human and financial resources in preschool education; and considerations of equity, gender and
inclusiveness. These KIIs included in-person and virtual (telephone or web-based) interviews at
the national level; in-person interviews in Ainaro and Lautem; remote interviews with informants
in Oecusse, Baucau, Bobonaro and Viqueque; and a focus group discussion (FGD) with the ECD
Working Group, a collaboration group with stakeholders such as the MoEYS, UNICEF, Plan
International, the World Bank and others.
Whilst the national-level KIIs enabled the evaluation team to answer the questions pertaining
to the policies and systems in place, the municipal-level data collection provided an overview of
the preschool education landscape. This distribution of municipal-level KIIs enabled the
evaluation team to study two municipalities in depth, whilst also including a larger number of
municipalities within the sample. In consultation with the ERG, the evaluation team
intentionally chose the sites, respondents and interview format to most benefit the integrity
and feasibility of the evaluation.
This data collection method is subject to the limitation of recall bias. Additionally, because of
staff turnover, some of the key informants may not have been able to address the full time
frame covered in this evaluation. Although the scope of the evaluation covers 2012 to 2020,
interviews took place in late 2021 and thus may have included more recent information from
21 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
2021. However, given the retrospective nature of the evaluation, this data collection method is
best suited for the circumstances.
4.3.3. Data collection tools
The KII protocols for this evaluation were based on the evaluation matrix and the KII questions
integrated into the matrix (see Annex D). Note that for questions allocated to the MoEYS on a
national level in the matrix, not all government officials interviewed were asked all questions
for the national MoEYS. Rather, the evaluation team selected the subset of questions that each
individual would be able to answer well.
4.4. Data Sources and Sampling
This section discusses the data sources, sampling and analysis methods for the desk review and
qualitative data collection within the evaluation methodology. The use of all these sources
enabled the evaluators to obtain multiple data points for each of the indicators within the
evaluation matrix. Doing so enabled triangulation across methods and data points to obtain a
diversity of perspectives, ensure data accuracy and mitigate the limitations of individual data
sources.
4.4.1. Desk review
For the desk review, the evaluation team selected data sources through a process in which the
UNTL team conducted an online search for available data relevant to the evaluation questions
and scope. After compiling the data sources, the team reviewed each document to indicate
which information, as outlined in the evaluation matrix, was pertinent to the study. During the
KIIs, the data collection team also asked respondents whether they had any additional
documents that they would be able to share for review.
One limitation of the desk review analysis is the assumption that the documentation is
complete. When certain strategies and activities were not covered in the documents, the
evaluation team assumed that those strategies and activities have not been conducted or
addressed. The evaluation team mitigated this challenge by confirming the documentation gaps
during KIIs.
4.4.2. Primary data collection
Given the limited timeline and scope of this evaluation, the team did not conduct site visits in
every municipality in Timor-Leste. Whilst the approach presents an understanding of preschool
education nationally, the evaluation team needed to base some of the conclusions on data
from a subset of the country.
22 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
Therefore, for primary data collection, the evaluation team purposively selected six
municipalities for the sample based on the recommendations of the ERG. The evaluation team
selected Ainaro and Lautem for in-depth analysis because they present varied preschool
education conditions. Ainaro has one of the largest numbers of preschool education projects by
development partners (specifically HANDS, and programmes from Plan International and CARE
International), whereas Lautem has relatively few projects. Lautem has the highest gross
enrolment rate (GER) for preschool education in Timor-Leste (almost double the national
average), whilst Ainaro has one of the lowest GERs (see Figure 3).32
The four additional municipalities selected for remote data collection also present varied
preschool education conditions: Oecusse is separated from the rest of Timor-Leste and thus
renders a unique sociocultural and logistical context, Baucau has the lowest national GER for
preschool, Bobonaro has a high GER for preschool (35 per cent in 2020 compared to the
national average of 27 per cent) and Viqueque is one of the two municipalities in which UNICEF
is implementing its community-based preschool programme.33 Each of the selected
municipalities has varied numbers of preschool education projects from various partners.34

23 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
The sampling plan for the specific individuals interviewed was also determined in consultation
with the ERG. This sampling plan enabled the evaluation team to reach a set of respondents
who could provide rich information relevant across the evaluation questions on both the
national and municipal levels (see Annex E).
The evaluation team made the decision to conduct interviews virtually or in person considering
respondents’ access to technology, the feasibility of hosting virtual or in-person interviews, the
risks of in-person data collection in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the available resources
for this evaluation. UNTL reached informants in Oecusse, Baucau, Bobonaro and Viqueque
remotely (via internet or telephone), considering the budgetary constraints, feasibility of travel,
and probable accessibility of selected participants. However, because respondents in Ainaro
and Lautem likely would be more readily available in person, UNTL conducted face-to-face, in-
depth interviews in the municipalities.
4.4.3. Data analysis
Data analysis occurred in alignment with the evaluation matrix. The matrix provided a
framework for the analyses (such as thematic codes) to ensure that the evaluation team
answered the evaluation questions thoroughly and as intended. The analytic approach included
data sensitisation and coding of KII transcripts, then analysis and interpretation of the data
from across the KII transcripts, documents and secondary data. After analysis of the KII
transcripts and desk review of relevant documents and secondary data, the evaluation team
critically reviewed the categorised data against the evaluation questions and created
summaries of the key findings. Team analysts triangulated the findings from across respondents
and data sources as much as possible.
Key informant interview data. The analytic plan for KII data included data sensitisation and
coding, and then analysis and interpretation of the data against the evaluation questions and
evaluation matrix.
Data sensitisation and coding. As a beginning stage of the data analysis process, the evaluation
team created a preliminary coding outline and structure based on the theory of change,
evaluation questions and interview protocols. This coding outline served as the tool for
organising and subsequently analysing the information gathered through the interviews. Coders
collaborated and discussed the outline to ensure that they were categorising data according to
the same standards. The AIR team then uploaded into NVivo® software all transcripts that were
prepared by the UNTL data enumerators. AIR coders then selected two sample transcripts to
code simultaneously and compare in order to ensure inter-rater reliability. Next, coders read
and organised the data from the transcripts based on the coding outline developed. The AIR
data analysts then read and reread the coded information from the interview transcripts to
24 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
formulate emergent themes from the data and categorise the data based on those themes and
the evaluation questions.
Analysis and interpretation of the data. During this iterative process of data analysis, reduction
and synthesis, evaluators characterised the prevalence of responses, examined differences
amongst groups, and identified key findings and themes related to the evaluation questions.
Team members paid special attention to differences amongst respondents according to gender,
location and role, as well as to any gender equality and human rights issues.
Document review. For the document review, the team used a spreadsheet template aligned
with the evaluation matrix. The team extracted into this template the relevant information
from the documents verbatim, then added a summary of the key point(s) for each indicator
based on the information in the documents.
Analysis of secondary data. The team did not carry out any in-depth data analysis with
secondary data. Instead, the evaluation reports descriptive statistics from secondary sources
(such as enrolment rates).
4.5. Stakeholder Participation
This evaluation relied on direct input from a variety of actors in Timor-Leste’s preschool
subsector. Our key informants included government officials from multiple departments within
the MoEYS, municipal education officials, global partners (such as UNICEF), NGOs and
programme providers (including the Church).
Based on the available resources for this evaluation, it was not feasible for the team to engage
with a representative sample of parents from across Timor-Leste. To gain at least some parental
input, the Timorese NGO Alola met with some parents in communities in March 2022 to ask for
their feedback and input on the recommendations from this evaluation, particularly in relation
to family engagement.
The team was unable to directly engage with preschool children due to resource constraints.
4.6. Ethical Considerations
For this study, AIR and UNTL adhered to strict requirements for the protection of human
subjects. This section provides assurances that team completed the work in line with United
Nations evaluation norms, standards and guidelines. The section then describes the method by
which AIR gained approval (exemption) for this evaluation from the AIR in-house institutional
review board (IRB). Finally, this section discusses the ethical considerations involved in this
evaluation.
25 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
This evaluation was exempt from ongoing IRB oversight because it was not human subjects
research (see Annex F). The subject of the evaluation included policies, programming and so
forth; it was not about individual human beings, nor did UNTL gather personally identifiable,
private information. This section does not address special protections for children because this
evaluation did not involve interaction with children.
4.6.1. Alignment with evaluation norms and standards
For this evaluation, AIR followed the Code of Conduct of the United Nations Evaluation Group,
which requires both a conflict-sensitive and a gender-sensitive approach to research and
adherence to the “do no harm” principle, as well as transparency, confidentiality, accuracy,
accountability and reliability, amongst other key principles. Specifically, with regard to the
protection of vulnerable individuals and communities, AIR respected and adhered to the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations Refugee Convention, the
Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
Discrimination Against Women. Evaluators also adhered to other human rights conventions and
national legal codes that respect local customs and cultural traditions, religious beliefs and
practices, personal interactions, gender roles, disability, age and ethnicity. Further, this
evaluation was conducted in accordance with the evaluation principles of openness,
transparency and participation. AIR ensured that the evaluation complied with UNICEF
Procedure for Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation, Data Collection and Analysis. The
evaluation was guided by the ethical principles of independence, impartiality, credibility,
responsibility, honesty and integrity.
The AIR IRB followed the standards set forth by the American Evaluation Association’s Guiding
Principles for Evaluators and the Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation.
Three general principles define these standards: (1) evaluators conduct evaluations legally and
ethically, considering the welfare of those involved in the evaluation, as well as the general
public; (2) evaluators conduct evaluations in a competent and efficient fashion that will lead to
reliable and accurate results; and (3) evaluators design evaluations and report the results in a
manner that is useful to and appropriate for the intended audience. Clear guidelines exist
regarding the expectations with which local data collectors must comply (e.g., how to store and
restrict access to physical files and electronic data files; how to treat identifiable information).
4.6.2. Ethical approval
All AIR staff, subcontractors and consultants involved in the collection of data from human
research participants adhered strictly to the requirements of the AIR IRB. The AIR internal
ethical review mechanism was used in lieu of associated ethical review committee of UNICEF,
given that the AIR IRB mechanisms comply with the minimum quality standards established in
the UNICEF policy. The AIR IRB (IRB00000436) is registered with the Office for Human Research
26 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
Protections as a research institution (IORG0000260) and conducts research under its own
Federalwide Assurance (FWA00003952).
4.6.3. Protection of human subjects
This evaluation did not include human subjects, according to international standards. For
example, according to United States statute 45 CFR 46, a human subject is “a living individual
about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) is conducting research.” Human
subjects research “obtains information or biospecimens through intervention or interaction
with the individual, and uses, studies, or analyses the information or biospecimens; or obtains,
uses, studies, analyses, or generates identifiable private information or identifiable
biospecimens.” This evaluation was not about any identifiable persons.
Nonetheless, the evaluators took care to ensure the safety and well-being of the evaluation
participants. At the beginning of each KII and FGD, the study team explained to participants the
nature of the study, how the team would and would not protect any information they choose
to provide, and that their participation was voluntary. The enumerators asked participants to
give their consent for participation prior to the start of the interview. The team also took
precautions to mitigate the risk of transmitting COVID-19 by following best practices as outlined
by the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and in
accordance with the national and relevant municipal requirements in Timor-Leste.
4.7. Constraints and Limitations
AIR identified four main constraints and limitations associated with this evaluation design:
1. Given the available resources for this evaluation, the evaluation team was unable to conduct
independent, direct observations of preschool education programming quality or of children’s
learning and development. This therefore limits the ability to draw conclusions about the
quality or impacts of Timor-Leste’s preschool education system.
2. Also due to resource constraints, the evaluation team was unable to include data collection
with end users of the preschool system (preschool teachers and families). This constraint
limited the ability to incorporate the perspectives of these stakeholders when answering
the evaluation questions.
3. Conducting interviews remotely can restrict the ability of interviewers to connect more
personally and read respondents’ body language.
4. Some of the stakeholders selected to interview for this study declined to participate. The
evaluation team was unable to collect any data from HANDS, which is a key programme in
Timor-Leste’s preschool subsector, or from an education leader whom the team planned to
interview in Oecusse.

5. Findings
This section presents the findings from the evaluation, organised by OECD DAC (Development
Assistance Committee) criteria, to assess the relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efficiency and
sustainability of the preschool education sector in Timor-Leste.
5.1 Relevance
We assessed the relevance of the preschool subsector with a focus on relevant policies and
plans.
5.1.1. To what extent does the government of Timor-Leste have comprehensive and
evidence-based policies and plans for the delivery of high-quality preschool education?
There were two areas of focus for this question: the extent to which (1) Timor-Leste has a
comprehensive plan for the delivery of high-quality preschool education, and (2) those plans
and policies are based on evidence.
KEY FINDINGS
Taken together, Timor-Leste’s preschool policies and plans address the key areas required for
high-quality preschool education systems. However, plans are fragmented across documents
and are mostly at a high level.
Timor-Leste has substantial gaps in the availability of key data from its population and context,
making it very challenging for stakeholders to engage in evidence-based planning.
Comprehensive planning. Timor-Leste has preschool education plans in place that partially
address the design and operation of a national preschool education system – although these
plans are somewhat fragmented. In 2011, the government published its National Education
Strategic Plan (NESP) 2011–2030.36 This national plan covers the entire education sector,
including the preschool subsector. This integration of preschool in the national education sector
planning is a strength of Timor-Leste’s approach. At the time of its publication (prior to the start
date for this retrospective evaluation), the plan addressed (1) the development of a national
curriculum; (2) a preschool teacher competency framework; and (3) preschool teacher training.

Leste, 2011.
28 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
Timor-Leste’s subsequent Policy Framework for Preschool Education37 further addresses five
areas of strategic focus: (1) expanding the availability of quality preschool education;
(2) increasing the training and ongoing professional development of preschool educators;
(3) supporting development of the national curriculum; (4) development of family and
community partnerships; and (5) development of a standards-based monitoring and evaluation
system.
Most recently, the MoEYS approved an Education Sector Plan (ESP) 2020–2024,38 which
continues the integration of preschool planning into the larger education system planning. This
document articulates strategies to strengthen the preschool subsector in the areas of (1)
infrastructure and physical capacity to serve children (including prioritising access for children
who live in remote areas and/or who are at risk of exclusion); (2) human resources and
subsystem management (including curriculum and licensing); and (3) the strengthening of pre-
and in-service training, support and supervision for preschool teachers. This document also
includes a list of specific activities that the country needs to undertake to implement these
strategies.
Use of evidence for planning. Preschool subsector plans should be based on two kinds of
evidence: (1) timely and relevant data from within the country, and (2) global evidence for best
practices in the subsector. The ESP 2020–202439 is based partly on data for preschool
enrolment and participation. However, in many areas, the country lacks the data needed to
make targeted planning decisions. The ESP identifies the need for a study to document the
costs and associated benefits of the various preschool models currently in use in Timor-Leste
and in similar contexts and to identify the combination of investments required to scale up
cost-effective models. The plan also indicates the need for better information regarding
teacher/child ratios and teacher workloads. However, there is little discussion in the ESP of the
need for effective systems to gather key pieces of information in an ongoing manner, rather
than as a one-time, fact-finding exercise. National preschool stakeholders confirmed that they
use the data for preschool planning but agreed that the data were not kept current and lack key
indicators, such as learning outcomes and teaching quality.
Timor-Leste’s Policy Framework for Preschool Education40 reflects an understanding of the
essential elements of quality preschool education at the classroom level, such as the need for a
safe and supportive environment, an effective curriculum, family involvement, well-qualified

teachers, and adequate teaching and learning materials. The framework also addresses the
need for a standards-based monitoring system and for effective partnerships. In addition, the
ESP 2020–202441 highlighted the continuing need for Timor-Leste to (1) develop supervisory
and human resources management systems for preschool educators, (2) create policies that
will allow for strategic use of the diverse preschool education models that Timor-Leste has and
(3) build up its preschool infrastructure.
However, the country’s subsector planning does not appear to address several elements that
are required for a well-functioning preschool system, including (1) comprehensive monitoring
that captures coverage, participation and child outcomes as well as the above-mentioned
quality indicators; (2) bidirectional data sharing from the national to the local levels; and,
relatedly, (3) data-driven decision-making in areas such as financing, budgeting, planning and
promoting equitable access to quality preschool education.
Stakeholders also noted that the MoEYS currently lacks sufficient personnel with knowledge of
effective preschool education standards to engage in planning on its own but receives much
technical support from partners such as HANDS, UNICEF and the World Bank. One national
MoEYS staff member summarised the issue well: “From the government side, especially the
[MoEYS], we do not have experts, but we work with partners, because they have experts that
work with us to run the programmes.” According to one informant, the MoEYS has employed
three Timorese professionals who were educated abroad to support and revise the preschool
education policy, and this informant would like to see the government draw upon a greater
number of qualified Timorese people in this way.
5.2 Coherence
The evaluation’s focus on coherence included collaboration amongst actors in child-serving
systems to meet children’s holistic needs.
5.2.1. To what extent do actors in Timor-Leste’s preschool education sector collaborate
and coordinate with one another and with actors in other sectors to meet children’s
holistic needs?
To answer this question, the evaluation team considered the extent to which actors in Timor-
Leste’s preschool education subsector (1) collaborated in ways that maximised national
availability of preschool programming, and (2) collaborated with actors in other child- and
family-serving sectors to meet children’s holistic needs.

30 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
KEY FINDINGS
Many different actors effectively collaborate on preschool access and quality in Timor-Leste.
However, no coherent national plan integrates their efforts into a larger framework.
The main national collaboration mechanism for preschool education was the ECD Working
Group. However, the group’s work stalled due to staff turnover and the pandemic.
At the municipal level, there are no systematic mechanisms of coordination in place amongst
municipal education authorities, partners and the MoEYS.
Collaboration within the preschool subsector. The ESP 2020–202442 highlights the ongoing
need for public purpose partnerships to expand and reform preschool education. The National
Directorate of Preschool Education is the main coordinating body for national and international
collaboration in the subsector. Based on guidance from the NESP 2011–2030,43 the National
Directorate of Preschool Education signs memoranda of understanding with partners and
stakeholders who support the development of preschool education in Timor-Leste. However,
MoEYS stakeholders claimed that this support was not enough to ensure adequate progress
towards the national goal of 80 per cent preschool enrolment by 2030. For instance, a MoEYS
leader stated that to reach the goal for 2040, “If possible, we should build preschools in all
places. With the support of development partners, … there are indeed many preschools. But
the reality shows that the percentage of children accessing [schools] is still small.”
A variety of stakeholders are collaborating with the government of Timor-Leste to ensure the
quality of preschool education. For instance, the World Bank works with the MoEYS and
INFORDEPE (Instituto Nacional de Formação de Docentes e Profissionais da Educação) to
develop teachers’ competency standards and training curricula. UNICEF helped support the
MoEYS in the development and drafting of the ECD policy and, together with Alola, helps
provide teacher training in community preschools. HANDS provides teaching materials, training
support for inspectors and leadership training. Plan International provides mobile libraries and
play materials to children. CARE International works with INFORDEPE, the Cabinet of Evaluation
and Curriculum Development,44 the Preschool Department and others to produce teaching
materials (e.g., Lafaek Magazine, an educational publication for children) and ensure their
alignment with the curriculum. ChildFund International works with the MoEYS and municipality

leaders to monitor their work and also provides training. The Civil Society Education Partnership
(CSEP) collaborates with the MoEYS to develop a child-centred curriculum.
The main mechanisms for collaboration amongst preschool education providers at the national
level were the ECD Working Group (described above) and an additional Early Childhood
Education (ECE) Working Group more specifically focused on preschool education. Stakeholders
indicated that that the ECD Working Group convened to identify financing sources and to help
draft the ECE policy in Timor-Leste. Doing so helps to ensure that the policy delivery is
consistent and that laws can regulate preschool education. But, as described above, the ECD
Working Group stopped meeting. The ECE Working Group has also failed to remain active
because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some development partners added that they did not know
the status of the ECD policy, although they had contributed to discussions around the drafting
of the policy. Re-establishing the ECD Working Group was one of the main stakeholder
recommendations to help improve coordination amongst development partners and MoEYS
around preschool education.
Despite the absences of
©UNICEF / BSoares
the working groups,
stakeholders described
collaboration amongst the
national, state and
municipal education
officials, as well as with
partners, as “very
effective” in identifying
problems and planning to
respond to needs. One
MoEYS leader stated that
the collaboration with
UNICEF was effective, adding that community preschools significantly improved preschool
enrolment. A different stakeholder cited the collaboration with HANDS in particular, noting that
HANDS was involved in writing the National Education Strategic Plan.
National-level partners also believed that collaboration around preschool access was effective.
UNICEF respondents reported that UNICEF and the HANDS programme worked closely together
to avoid duplication of efforts. Yet, a civil society stakeholder suggested that the MoEYS should
initially evaluate the needs for contribution with partners, so that partners can cost-share
preschool education in the most efficient way: “I hope that in the future, the Ministry should
take the initiative…, because it is easy when the government asks in the first place, when they
32 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
come with the plans. Some challenges that the government may face, they have to speak so
that the partners can have a look at their plan or budget to support.”
Nonetheless, whilst there are multiple players in the subsector, and generally worded goals
around collaboration, the evaluation team could not identify a written plan that specifies how
their efforts will fit together into a coherent national plan. Stakeholders from the ECD Working
Group mentioned that UNICEF and Plan International had been working with the MoEYS to
draft an ECD policy for Timor-Leste in consultation with other partners, but the effort stalled
with the turnover of key staff in partner organisations and ministries. Several stakeholders
noted that finalising this ECD policy would be a key step towards making more efficient use of
resources for preschool education in Timor-Leste. For instance, an NGO stakeholder stated,
“We have to improve our coordination tying with the policy. … We are pushing this draft and
policy. But until now, we ourselves don’t know this policy’s whereabouts. That’s why we have
fragility [in] coordination, because [with] no policy to lead us, we just implement our own
programmes at the government, organisation, and preschool level.”
National and subnational collaboration. There was collaboration between national and
municipal levels within the government. For instance, one national-level MoEYS staff member
noted, “The municipal level always works together with the national level. Even if the preschool
in the municipality is now under the control of the municipal administration, we need to work
together because at the municipal level they do not have capability.” However, stakeholders
reported that they lacked an established system to ensure regular coordination took place.
At the municipal level, there were at least some instances of poor coordination between local
preschool providers and government entities. For instance, a stakeholder in Ainaro recounted
instances of partners opening preschools without coordinating with the preschool inspector.
That said, the preschool focal point in Baucau observed better communication between
partners and the municipal authorities, suggesting that there is variation in the quality of
coordination across municipalities. Based on the data available, it is difficult to discern whether
the issues experienced in Ainaro are typical, or specific to that municipality.
Cross-sectoral collaboration. At the national level, members of the ECD Working Group
reported that the MoEYS, Ministry of Health, and Ministry of Social Solidarity and Inclusion
collaborated in the development of ECD policy. Stakeholders also stressed the importance of
the three ministries working together on ECD policy development and advocacy.
At the subnational level, stakeholders often mentioned collaborating with the health sector
around needs such as nutrition and health. This included stakeholders in the municipalities of
Lautem, Ainaro and Viqueque. For example, one municipal Director of Education reported, “We
collaborate with Health, Agriculture and Municipal Finance.… We collaborate with the health
33 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
part to vaccinate the children and provide the medicine to them to fight the intestinal worms
each year. They always do it.” Similarly, a community preschool coordinator in Lautem said,
“Yes, we have collaboration about nutrition, and we get ‘merenda escolar’ [school lunch] from
the national level. ... We also cooperate with health staff to give vitamins and medicine.” One
municipal focal point for preschool education reported a similar situation, stating that each
student received 25 cents for school feeding, and municipal health visited schools to vaccinate
children. ChildFund representatives stated that they did not receive support from the
government around school feeding and health, but had their own nutrition programme. Further,
stakeholders from Lautem reported collaborating with the government around the Integrated
Service of Community Health programme, a primary health care programme in Timor-Leste,45 by
providing health staff with funds for fuel and food.
Collaboration between the preschool subsector and social protection and child protection was
mentioned infrequently. For example, a few municipal-level stakeholders reported
collaborating with social protection around safety during natural disasters. For instance, one
municipal Director of Education stated, “We work with the social protection to provide a
guideline for the preschool students so they can apply when the storm, landslide, heavy rains,
flood take place.” CARE and ChildFund reported working directly on child protection, and a
municipal government stakeholder also noted collaboration with these organisations around
child protection, including building public awareness. However, this kind of subnational
collaboration on child protection was not typical for the country.
5.3 Effectiveness
The evaluation examined effectiveness in terms of governance and accountability, workforce,
family and community engagement, participation, transitions to Grade 1, and considerations of
equity and inclusion.
5.3.1. To what extent does Timor-Leste have adequate governance and accountability
structures and strategies for the provision of quality preschool education?
For this question, the evaluation team addressed one criterion: the extent to which
responsibilities and accountability for the preschool subsector are clearly defined and
coordinated through mutually consistent communication.

Leste, Asia Pacific Family Medicine, vol. 13, no. 5, 2014.
34 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
KEY FINDINGS
In general, Timor-Leste has clear lines of authority and defined roles and responsibilities for
the preschool subsector.
Municipalities have primary responsibility for preschool financing and implementation, and
would like improved guidance on preschool standards from the national level.
National stakeholders want more effective collaboration on financing and implementation
amongst government actors and between government and other organisations.
Preschool subsector stakeholders reported having a sense of ownership and an understanding
of their respective roles in the system.
Coordination and communication on responsibilities and accountability. The government of
Timor-Leste has clearly defined roles and responsibilities for implementing preschool education
at the national level. The Organic Law of the MoEYS (Decree-Law No. 13/2009)46 describes the
responsibilities of the National Directorate of Preschool Education as well as supporting bodies,
such as the Directorate General (DG) of Preschool Education, Basic Education and Recurrent
Education47; the Cabinet of Evaluation and Curriculum Development; and others. A results
framework that is part of the ESP 2020–202448 includes medium-term goals (by 2024) that are
mostly for the larger education system and would benefit the preschool level as a part of that
system (for example, by improving infrastructure). As affirmed by one MoEYS leader, these
documents have allowed each directorate and department to clearly understand their roles and
responsibilities for implementing the national plan.
In the past decade, the government of Timor-Leste has also made efforts to promote
decentralisation through various laws and decrees, therefore assigning more responsibilities
and autonomy to its 13 municipalities in regard to education.49 Timorese law promoting
decentralisation states that responsibility for financing and administration for preschool is
placed at the municipality level.50 As one national-level stakeholder said, “Based on the system
that is in place, the Ministry is responsible for the policy and curriculum, whilst the municipal
education [administration] is responsible for the education mechanism at the municipal level.”

35 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
Accordingly, the municipal-level representatives interviewed from the MoEYS clearly articulated
their roles as those in which they implement the plans set forth by the national MoEYS. Across
municipalities, there is less guidance at the local (suco) levels. School inspectors at the
municipality level are also responsible for ensuring that MoEYS-provided school subsidies (to
procure teaching materials and office stationery and to conduct small repairs to school
infrastructure) are used as intended, and that the school receives the subsidy to which they are
entitled.
Across the national, municipal and local levels, the government, local NGOs and foreign
partners are responsible for financing and implementing preschool education. As described
above, the MoEYS and the National Directorate of Preschool Education assume planning
responsibilities, whilst the municipal governments follow their direction in implementing
programmes. According to one informant, the Department of Finance and the MoEYS staff
focused on preschool are responsible for planning the budget, activities and programme for
preschool education. However, this person said the municipal education sectors design their
own plans and allocate the preschool budgets within their municipalities. Local and global
partners, such as the World Bank, UNICEF and CSEP, also support the implementation of and
financing for preschool education. These partners supply a large percentage of preschool
education support in Timor-Leste, through their independent initiatives (coordinated with the
MoEYS) or through the government budget.
Some interview informants did identify issues with coordinating financing and implementation
mechanisms. One national-level Ministry leader indicated a need for improved collaboration
between the MoEYS and the Ministry of State Administration, particularly regarding budgeting.
This leader claimed that the two ministries need to examine the preschool education
responsibilities they have assigned to the municipalities in order to further improve
coordination. A member of the ECD Working Group noted that the problem with coordination
takes place between the ministries and municipalities, and within the MoEYS and amongst
partners as well.
Stakeholders indicated that they understand their role in and had partial ownership of the
preschool education plan. As described above, informants clearly articulated the work for which
they were responsible, and their various roles as outlined in the laws governing the provision of
preschool education. At the national level, the MoEYS is the key entity responsible for planning,
budgeting and ensuring preschool implementation. Government partners, implementing NGOs
and MoEYS staff at the municipal level all indicated that it is their responsibility to follow the
plan set forth by the MoEYS. Although preschool education is considered ‘decentralised’, with
municipalities and school administrators each having a role, municipal-level leaders indicated
that they follow the direction from the national level. For instance, one municipal focal point
36 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
stated, “I do not plan anything that is only based on what I want and think. I have to follow
instructions. … We in the municipality will not do our own plan.”
Similarly, international partners and national NGOs all indicated that they follow the plan of the
national MoEYS. Representatives from organisations like UNICEF, CARE International, Plan
International and community preschools all claimed that their ultimate responsibility is to
support the MoEYS and follow their plans. Multiple people referred to the MoEYS as an
‘umbrella’ for all preschool programming. Stakeholders’ focus on the MoEYS plans
demonstrates successful coordination of preschool implementation. However, many municipal-
and local-level implementers do not feel engaged in the planning process or that their feedback
is considered (see Section 5.4.2).
5.3.2. To what extent does Timor-Leste have a sufficient and well-trained preschool
education workforce?
This research question included five indicators that addressed the extent to which Timor-Leste
(1) has a robust and coherent strategy for recruiting appropriate staff for the preschool education
subsector; (2) has defined a core set of professional competencies and standards for preschool
educators; (3) has initial requirements defining the level of education and training required to
teach preschool education now, whilst also specifying how these requirements will become more
stringent over time; (4) has effective and flexible pre-service preschool education teacher training
programmes; and (5) promotes continuous workforce improvement and staff retention for its
preschool education workforce.
KEY FINDINGS
Timor-Leste is following best practices by considering preschool teachers as part of the regular
educator workforce.
Timor-Leste is not able to provide enough qualified teachers for its preschool classes.
Government hiring of preschool teachers is not a priority, and hiring is based on funding
availability rather than needs.
There are insufficient numbers of teacher trainers available. Most preschool teachers lack
formal training, although there are some professional development opportunities.
Standards exist for teachers in general, but there are no standards specifically associated with
developmentally appropriate practice at the preschool level.
There are almost no training opportunities around education for children with disabilities.
37 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
Staff recruitment for the preschool subsector. According to EMIS data,51 Timor-Leste had 673
public and private preschool teachers in 2018 for 21,399 students, equating to a
student/teacher ratio of nearly 32 to 1 – far above the 20-to-1 ratio that UNICEF recommends
for the preschool level.52 If Timor-Leste were to reach its 2024 target of 50 per cent preschool
enrolment (with a 20-to-1 ratio), the country would need approximately 1,600 teachers. There
is substantial evidence that low student/teacher ratios are especially important for children
from disadvantaged backgrounds53 – which is the case for most children in Timor-Leste (and is
also related to issues of equity within Timor-Leste).
Respondents agreed that there are not enough preschool education staff in the subsector to
meet the demand for the preschool provision. As one person said, “Our schools are still crying
for teachers.” This sentiment was echoed by UNICEF, MoEYS, the World Bank and respondents
at the municipality levels. The UNICEF respondent further explained, “Even you look at the
infrastructure – the number of preschools – they do not have enough to meet even half of the
target set in the national plan.”
Timor-Leste has multiple strategies for recruiting preschool teachers, but according to
respondents, it is unclear when they use each strategy and to what extent each strategy will
meet the needs of the field. For example, one MoEYS leader said, “We opened the vacancy
based on the financial capacity that the Ministry [had],” implying that the government recruits
teachers based on financial capacity rather than the specific needs of the subsector.
The government of Timor-Leste has a salary standard set by the civil service commission. This
standard ensures there is no difference in the salary of teachers in all education levels,
including preschool (and is a best practice). However, a reward system is lacking for volunteer
teachers who teach at community schools and NGO schools – despite text in Article 9 of
Decree-Law No. 23/2010 stating that there should be a system of special incentives for
educators.54 According to a municipal focal point for preschool, “We have to acknowledge that
the voluntary teachers are outnumbering the permanent and contracted teachers, because at
each school, there might be two or three voluntary teachers.” Reportedly, volunteer teachers
tend to leave after a few years. As one respondent explained, “They are teaching voluntarily
because they believe that when the government take[s] over this preschool, they will
automatically be the educator for that preschool centre. But in fact, the government … does not

put money to support the continuity of those educators. … That’s why, after the establishment
of the preschool for two or three years, these educators stop teaching.” According to interview
participants, in some instances volunteer teachers receive small monthly stipends that amount
to roughly 25 to 30 U.S. dollars, but in other cases the NGOs only have the resources to cover
their telephone bills.
There is currently a lack of training for teachers on how to identify and support children with
disabilities. According to one staff member from INFORDEPE, “Teachers have sufficient
knowledge [of] how to treat children, but for the children with disability, there is no specialised
teacher yet.” Furthermore, many respondents noted that data on this population are lacking;
that is, they do not know the extent of the need for special education teachers at the preschool
level. As a respondent from UNICEF explained, “There have not been any systematic system[s]
of identification of children with disabilities in school. Most people think about physical
disability rather than mental disability. There are other types of disability not so visible, but
[they] have not been detected or identified.”
Professional competencies and standards for preschool educators. The Career Statute of Early
Childhood Educators and Basic and Secondary Education Teachers (Decree-Law No. 23/2010)55
includes a framework of mandatory competencies for educators. According to the NESP,56
stakeholders developed a preschool teacher competence framework for teachers working with
children under 6 years old and integrated it into the National Teacher Competence Framework.
As it stands, the framework includes, but is not specific to, preschool teachers, since it also
applies to primary and secondary school educators. The competencies cover knowledge, skills
and attitudes of educators. According to the NESP,57 stakeholders revised these competencies
to provide practical evaluation indicators and to align with standards of the Southeast Asian
Ministers of Education Organisation.
Requirements to teach preschool education. Article 48 of the Basic Law of Education
(No. 14/2008)58 states that early childhood educators should possess a diploma for teaching
conferred by a higher education establishment, such as a university offering bachelor’s degrees
or the equivalent. However, the Career Statute of Early Childhood Educators and Basic and
Secondary Education Teachers (Decree-Law No. 23/2010)59 offers a “special transitional
regime” exemption for those already working in preschool education institutions who do not

preschool teachers in
Timor-Leste reportedly do not have formal teacher training or an established background in
education. For instance, one MoEYS member said, “Most of the teachers do not have the
teaching background. However, we have to accept it and keep going with this reality.”
Respondents from UNICEF, the MoEYS and local directors of education echoed this sentiment.
One municipal Director of Education explained that teachers do not have degrees specifically in
preschool education because until now, “[there have been] no rules saying that educators
should have their degree [in the] areas of preschool education. Some of them just finished their
secondary school [education, and] they are now teaching pre-primary school.” ChildFund also
reported that most of the teachers working in the community preschools only have a secondary
education, whilst a few graduated from the university in areas other than education. To fill this
gap, schools hire untrained teachers or facilitators to lead classrooms and attempt to prepare
teachers through in-service trainings.
Pre-service preschool education teacher training programmes. Timor-Leste does not have
sufficient pre-service training available for preschool teachers. Whilst UNTL has graduated
preschool teachers, institutions such as the Catholic Institute of Teacher Training in Baucau and
INFORDEPE reported not having a specialised preschool education curriculum ready to be
implemented. A staff member form INFORDEPE explained that a preschool curriculum has been
started, but only 4 of the 12 content areas are complete. An informant from the Catholic
Institute of Teacher Training said, “We do not have the specialisation area here in the

institution regarding preschool education. We are only specialised in primary education, but we
are open to work with the preschool teachers.”
Given the overall shortage of contracted and permanent teachers in Timor-Leste, there is likely
a shortage of teacher trainers. Timor-Leste’s Career Statute of Early Childhood Educators and
Basic and Secondary Education Teachers (Decree-Law No. 23/2010)62 states that those who are
currently serving as teachers, but who do not hold a bachelor’s degree as stipulated by the
Basic Law of Education, are subject to “an intensive training programme determined by the
[MoEYS]” in order for them to obtain a certification equivalent. This intensive teacher training
programme is designed to provide teachers with the knowledge outlined in the National
Teacher Competence Framework (described in Section 5.3.2).
Preschool staff who are not formally trained in preschool education have opportunities to
develop their competencies through in-service training. According to respondents, most of
these trainings are hosted by INFORDEPE and partners such as ChildFund, the HANDS
programme and CARE International. For example, a staff member from ChildFund described
how they support the MoEYS in capacity building: “Those educators who are not graduated in
the preschool education area, they have to attend the training continuously so that they can
increase their knowledge on preschool teaching. That’s why ChildFund has [an] important role
to help [the MoEYS] in [the] preschool education area based on the capacity that this
organisation has.” INFORDEPE utilises a three-module training, the creation of which was
funded by ChildFund. The training covers curriculum guidance, classroom management and
play-based learning. Whilst many respondents reported that INFORDEPE regularly offers
training, some teachers reported that they went for long periods without training. Additionally,
NGOs reported offering their own types of in-service training to their teachers. For example, a
respondent from the Alola Foundation said they provide trainings on teaching methodology
and the preschool education curriculum.
Article 23 of the Career Statute of Early Childhood Educators and Basic and Secondary
Education Teachers (Decree-Law No. 23/2010)63 states that continuing training is “an integral
part of working hours and the functional content of teaching staff” and is ensured by the
MoEYS. Article 6 states that teaching staff are obliged to participate in “continuous and
intensive training” through training programmes that are accredited and guaranteed by the
MoEYS. Yet, as stated in Section 5.3.2 of this report, the MoEYS has not yet developed

standardised in-service training programmes for preschool teachers but has articulated
intentions of doing so in the ESP 2020–2024.64
An MoEYS staff member commented on the reach of current in-service professional development:
“We can now say that most of [the] teachers have received capacity-building training to be better
teachers. Not that they understand everything, but at least they have the capabilities to teach
children.” (But note that the evaluation team was unable to corroborate this statement.)
Regarding the timing of the trainings, a respondent from the MoEYS discussed how trainings can
sometimes take teachers away from their classroom and, in turn, negatively affect the students’
educational experiences. INFORDEPE also reported addressing this issue by scheduling trainings
during the school holidays. Overall, a number of training opportunities are available to in-service
teachers who are not qualified to teach preschool, and key stakeholders hope to grow these in-
service trainings to meet the needs of the teacher workforce.
5.3.3. To what extent are families and communities engaged as active partners in the
preschool education sector and in promoting young children’s learning?
To answer this question, the evaluation team considered the extent to which (1) family and
community engagement is a priority for Timor-Leste’s preschool education subsector, and
(2) preschool education subsector stakeholders use effective strategies to engage families and
communities in preschool education.
KEY FINDINGS
Timor-Leste has several policy directives regarding family and community engagement in
schools, but some stakeholders lacked information about how to implement these policies.
Family and community engagement was almost entirely focused on what families and
communities could provide for schools (money, labour, etc). Stakeholders seemed unaware
that preschool programmes should also engage in strengths-based planning and partnership
with families and communities on how best to meet the needs of the children and their families.
There was cross-sectoral collaboration regarding nutrition/school feeding. There was much
less collaboration in other areas, such as health or child protection.
Prioritisation of family and community engagement. Timor-Leste has several directives in
place to encourage family and community engagement in preschool education. According to
64 World Bank Group and Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport, Education Sector Plan (ESP 2020 – 2024) Updating the
National Education Strategic Plan (NESP 2020 – 2030).
42 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
Decree-Law No. 3/2015,65 the national preschool
education curriculum is based on close collaboration
with the student’s family and community and is
intended to strengthen the child’s understanding of
their role in society. In addition, Law No. 9/2016 (Suco
Law)66 states that sucos have the responsibility to
“sensitise the community members to the importance
of schooling for children and mobilise the community
to the fight against early school withdrawal.” Regular
school inspections monitor schools’ compliance with
policy directives concerning family and community
engagement – namely, if schools have a parent-teacher ©UNICEF / BSoares
association that is effective, meets regularly and operates according to best practices.
Inspectors should also encourage school administrators to engage with community-based
organisations to meet their schools’ needs. However, not all municipal-level MoEYS staff were
aware of these directives. Whilst a few individuals discussed teacher trainings on the topic of
parental engagement, several other stakeholders said they had not received any guidance.
Overall, there was a common understanding amongst stakeholders that family and community
engagement in preschool education is very important. Respondents from NGOs and schools, as
well as directors of education, reported that family and community engagement provides the
support necessary to build and staff new schools. For example, one municipal Director of
Education said, “When I visit the community, they always ask us to open more preschools. That
is a sign that they understand the importance of the preschool.” Respondents also stated that
family and community engagement are important because preschool students need adults in
their lives to get them ready for school and to take them there. As a public preschool
coordinator explained, “For me, the engagement of parents and community is very important
because the students are just small children. They need their parents to be involved to organise
them.”
Strategies to engage families and communities in preschool education. National-level
respondents from the MoEYS reported partnering with HANDS to meet with municipal leaders to
sensitise them on preschool education and to encourage them to share information with their
municipalities.

43 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
Families are involved in preschool education programmes in a variety of ways, although there
were only a few instances in which respondents reported family involvement that went beyond
asking families to pay for things or provide resources. Regarding the physical labour that
parents provide, a community preschool coordinator explained, “When we decide to clean up
our environment, mostly parents will take over this work. They organise together with the
parent-teacher association. So, when we need help from parents, we just coordinate with [the
parent-teacher association] for discussing anything about our school.” There were mixed reports
about parents volunteering, however; whilst a staff member from CARE mentioned that parents
help teach the students, a community preschool coordinator said, “[Parents] never [assist in the
classroom]. [If we wanted], they would help us, but they said we teachers work for it because
we get paid. They would not get anything for becoming [volunteer] assistants.”
Community resources such as community leaders, religious spaces, primary schools and existing
social networks are leveraged to help preschool education programmes meet the needs of
children and families. Additionally, there were reports of preschools partnering with the MoEYS
to provide a school feeding programme called ‘merenda escolar’. As a respondent from the Alola
Foundation said, “The community, parents and the local leaders provided spaces to us to teach
the children, and they themselves wrote the proposal to establish some preschools in where they
live. That is why I said the collaboration [with the families and community] is very effective.”
5.3.4. To what extent do children in Timor-Leste have access to and participate in
quality preschool education programming?
AIR answered this question based on two criteria: the extent to which (1) children across Timor-
Leste have access to quality preschool education programming, and (2) there is public demand
for quality preschool education programming in Timor-Leste.
KEY FINDINGS
As of 2020, Timor-Leste’s GER for preschool (public and private programmes combined) stood
at 27 per cent, with nearly identical rates for boys and girls. However, it is unclear what
percentage of children are in programming that is of good quality.
Timor-Leste has a developmentally appropriate curriculum for the preschool level, but there is
a lack of clarity about whether programmes should use first-language instruction.

(see Figure 4).67 As of 2020, 16,869 Timorese children attended public preschool, and another

boys and girls are almost identical.68 These figures only reflect enrolment. The evaluation team
could not identify any available database that combines enrolment with quality data, so it is
unclear how many of these children are in programming of adequate quality.

The government of Timor-Leste approved and implemented its current preschool curriculum in
2015.69 This curriculum includes many best practices for preschool education, including
elements to promote literacy, basic mathematics, motor skills and general development for
children aged 3–6 years. Leaders in the MoEYS also emphasised the importance of play-based
learning in the curriculum. As a member of the Cabinet of Evaluation and Curriculum
Development explained, “The most important thing is that the kids learn from their playing.
They have to play a lot. We do not impose the rule to enforce them to write. They have to
play.” This emphasis on play-based learning is an essential best practice in ECE.

According to interview data, public and private preschool institutions both use the curriculum in
the classroom (although a few implementers said that they still use the old version). In addition,
many preschools have play materials to align with the curriculum, due in part to the active
support of ECD partners who provide them. Nonetheless, preschools often lack sufficient
curricular materials. In these cases, teachers demonstrate
creativity by using local materials such as rocks, sticks and Best practice

have a different government, they always change their policy. Some want to promote Tetum at
school, whilst others want to promote first languages. We are confused.”70
Public demand for quality preschool education programming. Respondents referred to several
system-level initiatives to encourage families to use available preschool education services at
the community and national levels. At the national level, for example, a respondent from CARE
International spoke about how they prioritise community dialogue and share information
through Lafaek Magazine in all 13 municipalities. A UNICEF staff member explained that they
have several campaigns to encourage preschool enrolment and that they host parent groups to
teach fathers and mothers about how to interact with their young children and the importance
of preschool education. Furthermore, the MoEYS is partnering with HANDS to facilitate access
to preschool education.
According to a national education staff member, the MoEYS invites municipal education leaders
to attend a workshop so they can then share information with parents in their respective
municipalities. Stakeholders at the community level also employ strategies to encourage
families to use the preschool education services. For example, the director of a public preschool
said, “Our school is located next to the primary school, so we tell the students and teachers
from that school to tell their parents to bring their younger siblings to enrol in our preschool.
The response from the parents is positive.” A municipal focal point for preschool also explained

that they reach out to parents in letters, announce information in church or post information
on a notice board.
Preschool education is not widely considered a public good in Timor-Leste (on par with basic
school). Barriers to the Timorese population viewing preschool as a public good relate to the
lack of a national mandate to provide preschools for all children, limited access to preschools,
and a lack of understanding of the importance of schooling before 6 years of age. Stakeholders
said that if preschool were to be mandated by law (rather than made optional), it would be
seen more as a public good.
5.3.5. How and to what extent does Timor-Leste support children’s successful
transitions into Grade 1?
This evaluation question had a single criterion: the extent to which Timor-Leste’s preschool
education programming is aligned with Grade 1 expectations for incoming students.
KEY FINDINGS
Stakeholders agreed that in principle, preschool programming should align with the
expectations for students entering Grade 1, but in reality, there is no deliberate alignment.
National MoEYS stakeholders did not believe there was sufficient Grade 1 data to help them
determine whether children were adequately prepared for basic school, but other stakeholders
did use Grade 1 data this way.
Alignment of preschool education programming with Grade 1 expectations. In planning for
the preschool subsector, stakeholders in Timor-Leste’s education system have considered
Grade 1 readiness but have not made it a priority. MoEYS and partners have acknowledged
research showing the importance of preschool education for children entering primary school.
Accordingly, when discussing the goals for preschool education, stakeholders concentrated on
improving access to preschool education rather than on specific standards for readiness.
The NESP 2011–203071 includes the vision that “[i]n preschool, [children] will develop the basic
skills and knowledge to be prepared for basic education.” However, the goals set forth by the
plan concentrate on access and do not include specific indicators for school readiness. Some
ongoing efforts to support school readiness include revising the national preschool curriculum,
71 Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sport, National Education Strategic Plan (NESP) 2011–2030, Ministry of Education Timor-
Leste, 2011.
47 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
which includes objectives to promote school readiness through basic literacy and math skills as
well as physical and socio-emotional development.
A 2019 evaluation of UNICEF’s community preschools model in Ermera and Viqueque showed
that children from aldeias with community preschools showed significantly better school
readiness in emergent literacy; knowledge of health, hygiene and safety; and cultural
knowledge, relative to children from aldeias with no preschools.72 UNICEF has also
implemented a readiness programme to ensure that children can transition smoothly from
preschool to Grade 1.73 So far, however, according to informants from UNICEF and the MoEYS,
this programme has reached only 11 schools,74 and some MoEYS leaders reported that they do
not believe it will be feasible to implement the programme nationwide. Although preschool
education stakeholders have considered expectations for Grade 1 readiness, their subsector
planning currently emphasises general access to preschool in the hope that any preschool
education will benefit students as they transition to Grade 1.
There seemed to be confusion about the availability of Grade 1 data to help assess the
adequacy of school readiness. A national-level MoEYS staff person claimed that the national-
level MoEYS does not have data on Grade 1 enrolment, dropout and repetition. A municipal-
level inspector also said, “We don’t use this data yet. For Grade 1, we are not yet doing
research on this issue looking [at] the quality of preschool.” Correspondingly, the MoEYS
preschool planning documents focused more on data related to preschool access, rather than
on effectiveness of preschool education as evidenced by Grade 1 success. UNICEF, however,
does use EMIS data from the national and municipal levels to inform its preschool
programming. For instance, when the organisation developed its school readiness programme,
it looked at repetition and dropout rates in Grade 1, including differences between rural and
urban areas and differences based on socio-economic status. One UNICEF respondent said,
“Whenever we develop new country programmes or annual work plans, we review enrolment
data, we look at repetition rates, we compare the indicators, and [we] also look at how that
particular municipality performs in terms of enrolment.” The UNICEF planning documents also
include data on Grade 1 dropout, literacy and numeracy rates to inform improvements in
preschool education quality.75

their peers.

5.3.6. To what extent does the preschool education system promote equity – including
reaching the most marginalised – empowerment of women and girls, respect for
linguistic diversity, and inclusion of people with disabilities?
To answer this question, the evaluation assessed the extent to which Timor-Leste’s preschool
education subsector strategy focuses explicitly on building equity.
KEY FINDINGS
Timor-Leste has strategies for the professionalisation of the preschool workforce but does not
use them consistently. Lack of designated funding is a significant constraint, leaving children in
more remote or rural areas with less access to qualified teachers.
The country has a plan to incentivise qualified teachers to work outside the capital, which can
help improve equity in access to professional teachers.
Education system monitoring formally addresses gender and disability, plus non-discrimination,
but is not explicit about linguistic diversity.
Strategies focused on building equity. One way to promote equity is to ensure that all children
have access to qualified teachers. Whilst respondents identified key strategies to address the
professionalisation of the preschool workforce, none of them were confident that the
strategies were implemented consistently or reliably. For example, a respondent from the
World Bank said that they help INFORDEPE improve and review the teachers’ competence
standards and the teachers’ training curriculum framework. However, the respondent was
unsure to what extent the standards and frameworks were being implemented at the national
level. A respondent from INFORDEPE claimed that the quality of these efforts is highly
dependent on the budget available. Furthermore, it is clear that many preschools are staffed by
volunteer teachers who have never had any formal education training. Therefore, whilst there
is evidence of strategies to address the professionalisation of the preschool workforce, there is
little evidence to support the fact that these efforts are widespread and implemented
nationally. It is worth noting that the ESP 2020–202476 addresses the development and
application of a human resources policy with incentives for teacher relocation outside Dili – an
approach that may help address equity in access to qualified teachers.

49 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
The evaluation team was unable to find documentation that explicitly addresses how the
country should meet the needs of children and families from diverse linguistic backgrounds.
Timor-Leste’s education sector considers elements related to student diversity in its monitoring
system, although these elements do not appear to be a predominant focus. The School
Inspection Manual77 includes several guidelines for inclusive education. Specifically, inspectors
must assess whether the school regulations promote inclusiveness and non-discrimination;
whether the infrastructure is “constructed in ways that enable all students – male, female,
disabled, and terminally ill students – to access the school”; and whether teachers promote
learning opportunities for all students “regardless of race, religion, skin colour, physical
condition, sexual orientation, and social status.”
Although the MoEYS has these guidelines in place, the evaluation data show mixed views about
the extent to which stakeholders have access to data related to inclusivity. Ra’es Hadomi Timor
Oan, the national organisation for people with disabilities in Timor-Leste, reported in 2015 that
the EMIS does not adequately disaggregate data by disability.78 A national stakeholder and
several municipal-level stakeholders claimed that they do not have data related to students
with disabilities. Some interview respondents mentioned that the Department of Inclusive
Education instead has access to these data. However, stakeholders were more familiar with
data related to gender. For example, a municipal-level inspector described coaching teachers
on promoting gender integration in the classroom.

5.4 Efficiency
In the area of efficiency, the evaluation addressed budgeting and financing, timeliness, and
quality assurance and data-driven decision-making.
5.4.1. To what extent does Timor-Leste have adequate budget and financing
mechanisms for the provision of cost-effective preschool education?
To answer this question, the evaluation examined the extent to which (1) Timor-Leste’s
preschool plan is well costed; and (2) resource needs, gaps and funding strategies have been
identified and are monitored.
KEY FINDINGS
Timor-Leste’s preschool subsector is severely underfunded. As a portion of GDP, its budget
allocation to preschool is just under one tenth the recommended level. Within the education
sector budget, the subsector receives one third or less of the recommended proportion.
Timor-Leste appears to start with a budget allocation for preschool in the education sector plan,
then determines how to use it best, rather than basing the budget on a comprehensive subsector
plan with corresponding identification of what resources are required.
The MoEYS and partner organisations have effective communication about how partners can
help the MoEYS obtain necessary resources for the subsector.
Costing of the preschool education plan. The OECD recommends a global standard of
1 per cent of GDP allocated to preschool education. As of 2014, the allocation in Timor-Leste
was less than one tenth of that figure (at 0.09 per cent).79 In terms of the education sector
budget specifically, a national-level MoEYS respondent explained, “The state budget allocation
has not met the criteria of the minimum global standard (15 per cent to 20 per cent of the state
budget to education), and also the preschool education has still 5 per cent from the general
state budget of the MoEYS.”
Timor-Leste’s costing information appears to be spread across multiple documents/plans.
These include Timor-Leste’s National Action Plan for Children in Timor-Leste 2016–202080; its

NESP of 2011 to 203081; its ESP 2020–202482; and the MoEYS annual education sector budget.
The evaluation team could not identify any one place in which all the key elements of the
subsector are addressed in a comprehensive way (see Section 5.5.1 for more discussion on this
topic). Rather, budgets identify a few priorities within the subsector. For example, the costed
action plan in the ESP 2020–202483 addresses specifics such as the need for an updated teacher
registry, provision of teaching and learning materials in alignment with the national curriculum,
assessment of teacher workloads and ratios, and so forth. These activities may be critical, but
they represent only a small portion of the resources that go into making the subsector function.
Whilst individual activities and plans may have been well costed out, the evaluation team did
not find documentation that linked the MoEYS subsector budget, planned targets and activities,
and actual costs. It is possible that budgeting was based on actual costs from work previously
done to carry out the same or similar activities, but the evaluators did not find documentation
of this, nor did stakeholders mention it.
Timor-Leste has included preschool in its EMIS since 2013.84 Timor-Leste’s ESP 2020–202485
includes projections related to the population of children aged 3–5 by municipality. According to
data from the most recent census data from 2015, Timor-Leste is projected to have nearly
100,000 preschool-aged children in 2030.86 The plan notes the number of children that the
country (and each municipality) should be prepared to serve with ECE, plus the numbers of
programme sites required for the country to reach the 50 per cent target for ECE coverage by
2024. These programmes will include a mix of formal preschools and community- and home-
based options. The plan also refers to EMIS data on preschool teacher availability and on
infrastructure and discusses the need to address critical shortfalls in these areas. There is a
notable gap in addressing quality of programming (apart from infrastructure) based on
programme quality data.
According to many informants, Timor-Leste’s preschool plans are more idealistic than they are
realistic or based on data-driven projections. One staff member from ChildFund pointed out that
it took 12 years, from 2002 to 2014, to provide just 2,900 children with access to preschool
education. As several other informants also indicated, if current enrolment rates are projected

over the next decade, the government’s plans to achieve 50 per cent coverage by 2024 and
80 per cent enrolment by 2030 will not be feasible. The NESP87 estimated (based on the situation
in 2011) that the government would be able to provide only half of the ECE programming
needed for the country to reach its enrolment targets. The plan specified the need for other
organisations to cover the remaining half, although there were no specific details. More
recently, Timor-Leste’s ESP 2020–202488 continues to highlight the need for help from donors
and partners to realise the plans for ECE. According to one member of the MoEYS, “We do not
have sufficient resources to prepare the children. That is why I said [the plans are] too
ambitious. Because when we define a target, we have to look at the progress of the
participation rate of the preschool education. But the progress is slow.” Most respondents
indicated that Timor-Leste’s preschool education plans could be realistic only if the government
invests significantly more financial resources into the preschool system, which officials claimed
is a challenge.
According to interview data, the MoEYS and partners have some successful synergies for
funding preschool education in Timor-Leste. When the government budget is not sufficient, the
MoEYS will ask for support from the partners. Groups such as ACETL (Joint Action for Education
in Timor-Leste) and the ECE/ECD Working Groups have coordinated activities to complement
the government’s budget. The National Directorate of Preschool Education additionally
coordinates with partners so that they do not duplicate funding with the MoEYS. One partner
described a recent, successful initiative in which the government led a meeting with partners
regarding how to apply for the Global Partnership for Education Fund. After discussion with
various agencies, the government secured additional financial support. A respondent from CSEP
stated, “Actually, there are some partners that want to support [preschool education]. They are
waiting for the Ministry to ask for support, but this does not happen. The Ministry should think
of how to share the plans or programmes that they need the contribution from partners.”
Identification and monitoring of resource needs, gaps and funding strategies. Rather than
starting with a comprehensive preschool sector plan and then creating a budget for it (including
gaps that could be filled by re-budgeting or resource gaps filled by partners), Timor-Leste’s
approach appears to start with the funding that is available and then determine the best use for
it. For example, municipalities are given preschool funds to distribute as needed, but their
decisions are largely not incorporated into national plans.

53 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
The education sector budget does contain line items for preschool education, but the
evaluators did not identify any particular prioritisation of preschool in the education sector
budget. As stated at the beginning of this section, Timor-Leste’s funding for the subsector is a
fraction of what is recommended by global standards – a fact understood by the MoEYS.
In terms of monitoring, Timor-Leste does not appear to use data monitoring to track
relationships between funding and resulting access, quality, effectiveness or equity in the
country’s preschool subsector. Municipality-level inspectors claimed that no such system exists.
According to a national MoEYS leader, the Timorese government has tracked the
implementation of the budget and programmes through the Dalan ba Futuru/Way to the
Future system and Unit for Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation.89 Dalan ba Futuru tracks
outputs of government funding but does not track outcomes. For education specifically, the
school inspection system and EMIS track school quality, although incompletely, as described in
Section 5.4.3. Whilst the government does monitor the quality of the programmes they fund,
the informants in the interviews did not mention using these data for any cost-effectiveness
analyses that link outcomes to programme costs.
Finally, apart from general statements in policies and plans about the importance of diverse
stakeholders in supporting the preschool subsector, there did not appear to be any specific
costed plans for how their contributions of resources would fit into a larger funding landscape for
preschool.
5.4.2. To what extent has Timor-Leste been able to implement its preschool education
strategy in a timely manner? Where are the bottlenecks?
The answer to this question is based on two criteria: the extent to which (1) Timor-Leste has
established a timeline with a phased approach for the rollout of preschool education
programming, and (2) stakeholders in the preschool education subsector take a proactive
approach to preventing and mitigating delays in the timely implementation of the preschool
education strategy.
89 Plans were made in 2021 to replace this system with the ANAPMA (National Agency for Planning, Motorization, and
Evaluation) system.
54 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
KEY FINDINGS
Timor-Leste has short- and long-term targets for the expansion of preschool education, but
stakeholders did not believe that these targets were realistic.
The country has plans to develop many aspects of its preschool subsector. However, plans are
not fully articulated with a scope and sequence of costed activities to be carried out over time
(including roles of different actors across the subsector to carry out the plan).
A strength of Timor-Leste’s approach to preschool subsector planning is its strong alignment
with the broader education sector.
Timeline with a phased approach for the rollout of preschool education programming.
As noted above, stakeholders did not think Timor-Leste’s targets or timelines for preschool
were realistic (see Section 5.5.1). The country does not appear to have any alternative targets
or plans that are more realistic. Timor-Leste also lacks policy directives with specific, integrated
timelines and roles/responsibilities for preschool service provision. The country does have plans
around preschool expansion and strengthening the education system as a whole (such as
through improved infrastructure), but these plans do not appear to have been implemented as
formal policies.
On the positive side, a strength of Timor-Leste’s preschool system is that it is part of the larger
education system. This approach is aligned with global best practices for preschool education.
Because of this integration, preschool subsector planning seems to be fully aligned with the
broader education sector timeline.
Use of a proactive approach to preventing and mitigating delays in the timely implementation of
the preschool education strategy. Timor-Leste’s ESP 2020–2024 discusses critical issues affecting
the country’s ability to provide preschool education as planned, such as more programme slots for
children (to be provided through a variety of programme models); more adequate classroom
space; better quality programming (curriculum, standards, etc); increases in preschool educator
training and skills; and better human resources management and system oversight. The plan also
includes goals for system development and discusses concrete steps that should be taken towards
achieving these goals.
The government stakeholders and preschool education partners who participated in this
evaluation had mixed views about whether there were regular reviews of Timor-Leste’s preschool
subsector plan. Although the MoEYS and partners meet regularly to discuss individual
programmes, it appears that these reviews may not include all stakeholders and may focus on
55 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
reviewing specific activities rather than the plans as a whole. For instance, one stakeholder stated
that the MoEYS meets each year to review plans and discuss any needs for change. This person
said that during the development of the ESP 2020–2024,90 government partners and other
members of the education community engaged in reviewing and validating the plan to identify
areas in need of support.
However, other stakeholders did not agree that these reviews happened regularly. One
stakeholder from ChildFund stated, “Regarding the review of the status of the preschool
education plan, I think I don’t have information on that because I have been working here in
ChildFund for eight years, but I [have] never [done a] review about this issue with the
government.” Another staff member from UNICEF said that meetings with members of the ECD
Working Group do not include reviews of the plans, only discussions of the forthcoming
priorities and activities. This UNICEF staff person said, “Last year at the end of the year, we sat
together and the Ministry presented some priorities for coming years to partners working in
different levels of education – preschool, primary, secondary education and technical education
– to see where and how partners can contribute to the achievement of the government
priorities. But that is not really the review of the plan. I don’t think there is a substantive review
of the plan.” Although several MoEYS stakeholders and partners claimed that they hold
meetings every three to six months to review both the status of and plans for individual
projects (namely, those of HANDS and CARE International’s Hatutan and Lafaek projects), these
meetings focus on specific programmes, rather than holistically reviewing the preschool ESPs.
5.4.3. To what extent does Timor-Leste have monitoring and quality assurance
systems in place for data-driven decision-making and continuous quality
improvement?
To answer this question, the evaluation considered the extent to which (1) Timor-Leste has
quality standards for preschool education, (2) Timor-Leste has effective preschool education
quality monitoring systems in place and (3) preschool education quality monitoring data are
routinely used for data-driven decision-making and continuous quality improvement.
KEY FINDINGS
Timor-Leste’s standards for primary and secondary schools address elements that are
applicable to preschool classes, but the standards are also in many ways not well aligned with
developmentally appropriate practice for the preschool age group.
90 Ibid.
56 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
Preschools that are under government oversight have routine monitoring visits, with feedback
for educators, but there is no consistent oversight for other preschool education institutions.
Preschool programmes lack practical guidance to know how to work towards meeting
standards (including incremental steps and low-resource options).
Stakeholders use the EMIS but consistently noted limitations regarding the timeliness and
comprehensiveness of the data – which negatively affected its utility.
Stakeholders at municipal and local levels reported that they sent information up to the national
level, but information did not routinely flow back down to them.
Quality standards for preschool education. Timor-Leste’s School Inspection Manual provides
standards and assessment tools that cover preschool to secondary school levels.91 However,
there is no distinction between standards for preschool classes versus other levels, and whilst
some of the standards are relevant for the preschool level, others are not appropriate. Decree-
Law No. 3/2015, which approved the National Curriculum of Preschool Education, gives
principles and goals for preschool education.92 However, these principles and goals have not
been sufficiently operationalised into standards with measurable indicators.
Preschool programmes may need guidance to help their leadership and staff know how they
can work towards meeting standards. Whilst specific programmes (such as those run by NGOs)
may receive technical assistance on how to carry out good practices, the evaluation team was
unable to identify a set of these kinds of informational resources for use across Timor-Leste’s
diversity of preschool programmes.
Preschool education quality monitoring systems. Timor-Leste took an important step with the
integration of preschool data into its EMIS in 2013.93 In addition, there is a set of goal-related
indicators that addresses several aspects of the preschool subsector in the ESP 2020–2024.94
However, as also discussed in Section 5.1.1, Timor-Leste does not have a unified and
comprehensive preschool plan that covers all key aspects of the subsector in one place (which
would include a monitoring plan for the system, rather than just individual components
separately).

(government-funded)
schools and private schools
that have agreements with
the government. This
manual covers the
preschool to secondary
school levels and addresses
the quality of pedagogy,
©UNICEF / NSoares management and access,
and inclusiveness. It is worth noting that the standards address the psychosocial aspects of the
school environment as well as physical features and management. Whilst many of these
standards are suitable for the preschool environment, other standards are not developmentally
appropriate. For example, children at the preschool level should not be routinely asked to write
answers to questions on a blackboard or to complete homework; preschool classes can
function perfectly well with no desks; and teachers should use flexible approaches to giving
lessons based on what is happening in the classroom, rather than following a rigid timetable. In
addition, critical aspects of quality preschool are missing, such as the use of hands-on, play-
based learning; the use of varied activities; and the implementation of lessons or activities that
go beyond rote learning.96 Without special standards for preschool classes, they can become a
downward extension of Grade 1 and therefore would not be developmentally appropriate. 97
The MoEYS has a structure of general inspection, which includes preschool inspectors who are
responsible for monitoring preschools in the municipalities. There is a total of 26 preschool
inspectors – two per municipality. Preschool inspectors originally were supported by the New
Zealand government (through the HANDS programme) and were trained on how to supervise
and monitor the learning progress in preschool education. According to a national-level
informant, preschool inspectors communicate with school inspectors and assess management,
quality of teaching and teacher qualifications. In some cases, municipal directors of education
also play a role in monitoring, such as in the municipality of Ainaro. Further, some NGOs
(including ChildFund) reported conducting joint monitoring alongside municipal preschool

58 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
inspectors. HANDS provides crucial support for the inspection process, including tablets to
facilitate the transfer of data and information.
At the municipal level, preschool inspectors and other education officials described monitoring
the conditions of schools, observing teaching methods and troubleshooting problems, such as
lack of materials. They also described sharing data with municipal- and national-level
stakeholders via WhatsApp. In addition, some of them said that they gave feedback on the spot
to help teachers improve their pedagogies. Nonetheless, understaffing of preschool inspectors
was one of the main challenges described by stakeholders. For example, one national MoEYS
member stated that there were not enough inspectors to cover all schools in Timor-Leste. There
were two dedicated preschool inspectors in each municipality, and according to EMIS data, the
median number of preschools per municipality is 34, with numbers ranging from 14 to 60.98 Many
inspectors noted the challenges covering all preschools in the municipality. For instance, one
municipal preschool inspector stated, “I think this is a little bit difficult to cover all of the
preschool in this territory, because there is no time for the two inspectors to cover all of the six
administrative posts in this municipality.” A UNICEF stakeholder echoed this view, noting that
inspectors were understaffed, and the monitoring work depended on the funding available: “The
inspection work depends very much on the funding. There is no money; there is no monitoring.
The inspectors [are] also understaffed.”
Municipal inspectors cited challenges in conducting monitoring, including transportation
difficulties and lack of support at the municipal level. For example, another municipal preschool
inspector stated that there is no support for inspectors at the municipal level, since there is no
decentralised inspection institution at the municipality. As a result, inspectors are unable to get
the support they need for things such as transportation costs at the municipal level. As one
inspector explained, “[There] is not a decentralised inspection institution in [this] municipality,
so we are just deposited in this municipality. So, in the end, we don’t get any support because
of the bureaucracy. This is a big challenge for us.” However, a different municipal inspector
noted that despite these difficulties, inspectors still effectively managed their monitoring
duties. The inspector explained, “But there are difficulties that they face every day. For
example, geographically, we are mountainous [and distanced] between preschools, but they
are doing [a] good job on inspection.”
Municipal preschool inspectors described receiving training from HANDS on curriculum,
technical observation, how to use technology, leadership and techniques of continuous
improvement. Most who reported receiving training were satisfied with the quality of

59 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
the training they received, though some said that they needed more training. Some inspectors
reported receiving training every three months, whilst others noted that the frequency of
trainings had decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. A few municipal education officials
cited issues related to the knowledge of preschool inspectors, including one director of
education who stated that the inspectors did not have a preschool education background.
Not all preschools are included in the monitoring system. For example, a UNICEF stakeholder
explained that community preschools are not registered with the MoEYS and therefore are not
monitored by municipal inspectors. This respondent stated, “This is the big challenge: It looks like
the inspectors are not responsible for community preschool education. That is the discussion that
we need to talk [with] the MoEYS [about] to find the solution from the legal perspective: who will
be responsible for these community preschools.” Further, one municipal Director of Education
said that some community preschools are not registered in his municipality and, therefore, are
not monitored by the preschool inspector at the municipal level. Nonetheless, preschools
operated by some other partners (such as Plan International) did report receiving monitoring
visits from municipal inspectors.
Regarding accreditation systems, stakeholders noted that there is a recently established system
of preschool accreditation whereby organisations that want to open preschool institutions must
undergo a licensing process and meet certain requirements. One MoEYS member explained
that organisations are required to meet basic criteria to open preschools, including having
adequate facilities and a playground or other suitable place for children to play and express
their creativity. Another national-level stakeholder said that MoEYS staff collaborate with the
local authorities to decide whether opening the school is logistically feasible. If so, the school
can open promptly.
Use of quality monitoring data for data-driven decision-making and continuous quality
improvement. Timor-Leste has systems in place to share and collate monitoring data from the
local and municipal levels to the national level, although challenges remain with respect to the
coverage and quality of data, as well as the efficiency and timeliness of data sharing. As
previously mentioned, Timor-Leste took an important step with the integration of preschool data
into its EMIS in 2013.99 National-level MoEYS stakeholders explained that the MoEYS has specific
preschool EMIS correspondents in the municipalities to control data collection at the municipal
level. The MoEYS distributes the data collection format to the municipalities, which then collect
the data from schools. Further, one national-level informant noted that only accredited preschool
institutions participate in the EMIS data collection. As mentioned previously, community
preschools are not yet accredited/registered with MoEYS, resulting in gaps in EMIS data coverage.

60 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
Because 46 per cent of all preschool-going children in Ermera and Viqueque attended UNICEF-
supported community preschools in 2019, the gap in EMIS coverage was quite significant.100
HANDS staff appear to have an important role in collating/relaying data to government
stakeholders at the national level. For example, a respondent from the MoEYS noted that a
HANDS staff member managed all the monitoring data from preschools and presented reports
to officials from the National Inspection Unit. Other monitoring data, such as data collected by
municipal inspectors, appear to flow from the municipal to the national level effectively, though
gaps remain in the coverage of community preschools. Municipal inspectors described collating
monitoring data, such as on student meals and teaching quality, and sending those data directly
to national-level MoEYS stakeholders through WhatsApp and, in some cases, KoBo Toolbox, a
resource for collecting field data using mobile devices. This was the case for municipal
inspectors from Ainaro, Lautem and Oecusse. One preschool inspector explained, “The
application is very useful for us to do our job well, and we can share the information with them
[the national education administrators] so that they can access it regarding what is happening
in the schools.” In addition, some municipality preschool inspectors reported sharing
monitoring data with municipal stakeholders, such as the superintendent and others.
However, stakeholders described several challenges, particularly related to the EMIS, that
affect the quality and timeliness of data sharing from the municipal to the national level.
For example, one MoEYS informant described these kinds of difficulties: “The MoEYS is
still facing various challenges regarding the data collection and production, especially the data
regarding the learning effectiveness and teaching quality. We are also facing
difficulties producing the updated data because we still a use manual data collection system,
and data verification takes time because we have limited human resources. As a database, the
EMIS has not had maximum capacities to capture the data regarding education quality,
especially the learning outcomes, school management, teacher training, etc.” A World Bank
staff member also mentioned gaps in EMIS data: “EMIS… is the source of data of the Ministry,
but unfortunately, the EMIS does not provide much information that we often need.” The
informant noted that the World Bank is helping support data entry training and budgeting to
help EMIS improve its system, as well as improving data access at the school level.

61 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
Stakeholders shared that delays in EMIS data collection were caused by lack of resources and
infrastructure issues, such as lack of internet connectivity. One MoEYS leader noted that these
delays affected the ability of MoEYS to plan and budget based on the most recent EMIS data. This
person said, “We only use EMIS data, but it is always late. For example, in [the] last year we
needed some data urgently to do the plan, but the data was not available, and we had to use the
data from the previous year. I personally think that to get the good data in rapidly, we need to
invest on the EMIS subsection so that they can do their job rapidly, because we know that when
the data is not available, our plan will not work smoothly.”
In contrast, some stakeholders at national and municipal levels still reviewed data to inform
decision-making. National-level MoEYS stakeholders reported that monitoring and EMIS data
were reviewed by different directorates at the MoEYS, including the Preschool Education
National Direction, the Cabinet of General Inspection, and – in the cases of accreditation – the
National Direction of Planning.101 National-level partners reported reviewing data such as
enrolment, dropout and repetition rates to inform their plans. A UNICEF staff member stated,
“We rely on EMIS a lot.” However, this staff member noted that EMIS data are available only at
the municipality level, not at the school level. Some stakeholders explained that at the municipal
level, monitoring data are used to inform plans at the national and municipal levels.
Despite reporting the review and use of data to inform plans, some municipal-level
stakeholders believed the data they shared with the MoEYS did not result in changes to address
the challenges they faced. For instance, a municipal preschool inspector stated, “Answering our
concerns is so difficult. Why? Because we always send information to the national level… but
they did not answer. ... I think we who are working at the municipal level have no value; we
work hard but have no value.” Similarly, a municipal focal point from another municipality cited
a lack of response from the municipal and national governments to their request for better
school facilities: “Some suggestions they consider, and some they do not. For example, we have
made several proposals and submitted them to the government to build the building for the
preschool that is now using a community house, but we received no response and
consideration on it. I don’t know why.”
101 According to the ERG, accreditation is now a responsibility of the Cabinet of Licensing, Accreditation, Evaluation and
Education Statistics. However, during the 2012–2020 time frame of this evaluation, it was a responsibility of the National
Direction of Planning.

5.5 Sustainability
In the area of sustainability, the evaluation considered the extent to which the country was
prepared to provide programming for the longer term and at scale.
5.5.1. To what extent is Timor-Leste prepared to provide long-term and scaled-up,
quality preschool education programming nationally?
This question incorporated the extent to which Timor-Leste has (1) the knowledge and
leadership and (2) effective plans and mechanisms in place for the development of preschool
education on a long-term and national scale.
KEY FINDINGS
Overall, the preschool subsector has effective communication between national and municipal
levels.
At least in some places, there were communication issues between NGOs and municipal
governments.
The government is able to fill its gaps in preschool subsector expertise through partners.
The country’s short- and long-term plans for the development and provision of preschool are
viewed as unrealistic by stakeholders.
Stakeholders reported that there were insufficient data on the subsector to make accurate cost
projections. Stakeholders also strongly believed that preschool education received inadequate
financing.
Knowledge and leadership required for the provision of preschool education on a long-term
and national scale. Because preschool education is decentralised at the municipal level,
communication between preschool education leaders involves the MoEYS at the national level,
municipal education officials and municipal administrations. Most national-level stakeholders
reported that communication between preschool stakeholders at the national and subnational
levels was going well. For example, one stated, “[The] municipal level always works with the
national level, even if the preschool is now under [the] control of the municipal administration.
Collaboration of levels is going well.”
However, some national stakeholders noted challenges coordinating between the municipal
and national levels. For example, one national-level informant said, “The responsibility of
preschool education is the Ministry of State [Administration], so [the MoEYS] and [the Ministry
63 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
of] State [Administration] should work together,” suggesting that communication between the
two ministries could be improved at the national level. Further, another national-level
informant mentioned that communication between the different levels was good.
At the municipality level, stakeholders generally stated that communication with national-level
stakeholders was frequent and adequate, though they typically had to travel to the national
level when there was an urgent need. However, a municipal Director of Education noted that
the communication between the municipal and national levels was sometimes hampered by
the bureaucracy. The Director stated, “Our role and responsibility is not under the [MoEYS] but
under the municipality administrator. If the administrator does not allow us to go to Dili, we
cannot go because we are under the leadership of the administrator.”
Government stakeholders generally believed that there was not sufficient preschool education
expertise within the ranks of the MoEYS. A national education leader said that there was a need
for more ECD expertise to support the work of the MoEYS in preschool education: “Frankly
speaking, we do not have the experts in the ECD area, especially in the national direction of
preschool education. Currently, we work together to elaborate the policy draft to take it to
consult with the judicial cabinet, but to make the implementation happen, we need [an]
advisor; we need an expert to design the programme to be implemented. I think this is the job
of the technical people.” Another national MoEYS leader agreed with this view, noting that
HANDS was the main source of ECD expertise for the government: “At the preschool, most
teachers do not have a preschool education background. We still have such difficulties facing
the teachers, let alone when it comes to the experts. We talk about the experts from the
government side, especially the [MoEYS]. We do not have experts, but we work with partners,
because they have experts that work with us to run the programmes, for example – the experts
from HANDS.”
Development partners also pointed to existing partnerships as sources of ECD expertise for the
MoEYS – specifically, partnerships with the HANDS programme and the World Bank. For
example, an international NGO informant said, “Partners provide funds to hire the [ECD]
experts to develop some things to be used, and they do not work alone, but they work under
the Ministry. ... The experts are involved with the Ministry to put their thoughts together to
develop in the part of education, particularly the preschool education sector.” Further, an NGO
respondent mentioned that a previous administration had organised an ECD conference in
which international ECD experts shared their experiences with the MoEYS and partners in
Timor-Leste.
Plans and mechanisms for the development of preschool education on a long-term and
national scale. Informants at the national and subnational levels agreed that the funding for
64 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
preschool education in Timor-Leste is not stable. At the national level, the amount of funding
varies each year, depending on the capacity of the state budget and the priorities of leadership.
Informants stated that the budget allocated to education is too small and that the portion then
allocated to preschool education is even smaller. At the municipal levels, leaders said they must
then divide the funds they receive amongst the various sectors and across all schools. One
municipal director stated, “If we get $5,000 for preschool, we have to divide this money to all of
[the] 43 preschools in this municipality, even though this money is not enough. … In the
municipality level, we do the planning and then we submit to the national level. Then this
money is allocated for us only in one packet, and then we have to divide/share this money with
other sectors in [the] municipality. So that’s why we only get a small amount of money, and it’s
not stable financing.” Another municipal focal point explained that the state funding often
arrives late and does not last the entire year. Sometimes municipalities don’t have enough
money to pay teachers, and they have to make additional funding requests. Given the
insufficiency of education funding, the government depends on support from partners. Several
government stakeholders found the reliance on external support to be an imperfect but
necessary solution.
Based on the documents reviewed, the government of Timor-Leste values financial
transparency in its education system. The NESP 2011–2015102 discusses the Public Financial
Information System and asserts that its proper use is required for development partners to
provide direct financial support to the education sector. In addition, the School Inspection
Manual103 includes a protocol for inspectors to verify the registry of school assets and financial
contributions of parents, as well as whether the records of school financial contributions and
their uses are publicly displayed.
However, the interview data regarding Timor-Leste’s mechanisms to ensure financial discipline
presented mixed findings. A government staff member said that when the MoEYS provides
money to schools, they use a school grant log to ensure that administrators use the money to
benefit the students and that inspectors check this log during their regular inspections. If school
administrators use funds improperly, the MoEYS conducts a disciplinary process or, in more
extreme cases, submits them to the criminal justice system. Multiple municipal-level inspectors,
however, reported that no system exists to ensure the appropriate use of finances, particularly
because inspections have not yet been decentralised to the municipal level. One respondent
claimed that no auditing has been done in his municipality for preschools since 2016 or 2017
because inspectors need an authorisation letter from the national MoEYS. This person said,

6. Conclusions
©UNICEF / BSoares
The preconditions and
assumptions underpinning the
theory of change largely held up,
and stakeholder beliefs were
consistent with the underlying
values shown in the theory of
change figure (see Figure 1). The
issues discussed in the findings
point toward challenges in
carrying out all the elements in
the theory of change at the desired scale and with the required quality, rather than any
fundamental issues with the theory of change itself or the underlying values.
Timor-Leste has many key elements in place that will be required for the continued
development of the subsector. The country has made definite progress in its expansion of
preschool programming over the past two decades. However, as of 2020, the GER for preschool
stood at 27 per cent, and stakeholders widely believed its 2024 and 2030 targets for preschool
coverage were unrealistic. On the positive side, there is gender equality in preschool
enrolment.
The remainder of this section presents overall conclusions across Timor-Leste’s preschool
subsector and considers (1) the enabling environment for preschool, (2) planning and
budgeting, (3) workforce, (4) quality assurance, (5) curriculum and (6) family and community
engagement.
6.1. Timor-Leste’s Enabling Environment for Preschool
Perhaps the strongest feature of Timor-Leste’s preschool system is that it exists as a subsector
within the larger education sector. This approach situates preschool as a critical element in
education and is consistent with global recommendations. In addition, Timor-Leste’s legislation
and goals for preschool education are appropriate and generally consistent with best practices
in the subsector.
Preschool stakeholders from both inside and outside government systems felt a sense of
ownership towards the subsector and understood their respective roles in making it work.
66 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
However, relationships between different stakeholder organisations were viewed as existing
one on one rather than as a strong, collaborative network. This view applied to both
relationships between the government and outside organisations, and between non-
governmental entities. This approach is inefficient, and it also may put subsector planning at
risk for becoming derailed if there is a change in government or organisational leadership.
National-level stakeholders wanted to see more effective collaboration amongst government
actors and between the government and other organisations – particularly regarding finance
and programme implementation. See Section 6.2 for more conclusions specific to planning and
budgeting.
With Timor-Leste’s decentralised preschool system, the municipalities play a strong role in
managing the preschool system in their locations. Government stakeholders reported that
there was good communication between the national and municipal levels. However, there is
no systematic mechanism of coordination in place amongst municipal education authorities,
partners and the MoEYS. And within at least some municipalities, there were issues with NGOs
not collaborating with (or sometimes even informing) government authorities of their plans for
preschool programming, such as opening preschool institutions.
Timor-Leste’s preschool subsector is severely underfunded by global standards, receiving just a
small fraction of the recommended allocation. This underfunding occurs both in relation to
Timor-Leste’s GDP and in relation to preschool’s share of the overall education sector budget.
Stakeholders also strongly believed that preschool subsector funding was highly inadequate
considering the country’s goals for quality preschool education.
6.2. Planning and Budgeting
Multiple actors are working on access and quality of preschool education in Timor-Leste, but no
single national plan integrates their efforts into a larger framework. Subsector plans are
fragmented across documents, are at a systems level or are specific to certain activities (such as
plans to train a certain number of teachers). The evaluation team was unable to identify a
coherent plan that specified step by step how the country was going to achieve its goals for
preschool, and that covered all key aspects of the subsector. The MoEYS and partner
organisations have effective communication about how partners can help the MoEYS get
needed resources for the subsector. However, this kind of planning seemed to be based on
specific needs at the time rather than the implementation of a larger strategic plan for the
subsector. The country’s ECD Working Group served as the main collaborating mechanism for
planning at the national level, but the group has become inactive due to staff turnover and the
pandemic.
67 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
One strength of Timor-Leste’s preschool subsector is that it is already included in the national
EMIS. However, stakeholders need the EMIS data to be timelier and more accurate than it is
now. In addition, some stakeholders were not sure how to effectively use the EMIS data
available. As in most countries, the EMIS captures only a few elements of what is happening in
the subsector, and it only accounts for programming under government oversight. There are
also information gaps in key areas that are not usually included in an EMIS but are necessary for
development and oversight of the subsector, such as how many children have disabilities (and
what types of disabilities) and whether the programming being provided is achieving its goals of
school readiness for children. Stakeholders also believed that they had insufficient data to make
accurate cost projections for preschool programming.
6.3. Workforce
Timor-Leste is following best practices by identifying preschool teachers as part of its basic
education workforce (rather than a separate kind of workforce). The country has teaching
standards, but these have not been adapted specifically for preschool teachers to ensure that
they use developmentally appropriate practices for young children.
Timor-Leste suffers from a severe shortage of qualified preschool teachers. The country is
unable to meet its current needs, resulting in student/teacher ratios that are substantially
higher than the recommended ratios for the preschool level. The hiring of preschool teachers is
not a government priority, and hiring plans appear to be based on the (inadequate) availability
of funding rather than strategic planning around how to address this workforce gap. The
country’s rate of development of its preschool workforce is insufficient to meet its short- and
longer-term targets for preschool coverage.
As in many countries, Timor-Leste resorts to untrained teachers and volunteers to help provide
preschool education. The country does have strategies to build the capacity of its untrained
preschool workforce, but implementation of these strategies is hampered by budgetary
constraints and insufficient availability of teacher trainers. On the positive side, preschool
teachers do have some professional development opportunities, and partner organisations
have been able to help provide capacity building for preschool teachers. It is worth noting that
the country has almost no training opportunities to help preschool teachers meet the needs of
children with disabilities.
Finally, government stakeholders do not think that the government on its own has adequate
expertise in preschool education. The MoEYS has been able to engage its partners to fill gaps in
expertise, and this collaboration has worked well.
68 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
6.4. Quality Assurance
A strength of Timor-Leste’s preschool system is its inclusion of quality assurance monitoring as
part of MoEYS education sector monitoring. The monitoring framework formally addresses
gender and disability, plus non-discrimination, but is not explicit about linguistic diversity.
Monitoring tools used on school visits have one set of indicators, regardless of the class level
being observed. Most of these indicators capture key elements of a safe and supportive
learning environment for any grade level. However, some are not appropriate for the preschool
level. By applying standards for higher grades to preschool classes, there is a risk that the
preschool learning environment will not be developmentally appropriate. On the positive side,
there are reports that some school inspectors do provide practical support for preschool
teachers (although this seems to be based on individual inspector initiative, rather than
systemwide standard practice).
Timor-Leste has too few school inspectors, and those it does have are asked to oversee more
schools than is practical. The result is that monitoring visits can be sporadic. Preschools that are
under government oversight (either directly operated by the government or that are offered by
NGOs in collaboration with the government) are part of the monitoring system. Other
preschools do not have any routine oversight as part of education system monitoring. NGOs
and other providers may have their own monitoring systems in place, but there is no
accountability to the government in terms of their quality.
Data on school quality does flow up from the local to the municipal to the national level.
However, information does not flow back down. In addition, municipalities would like improved
guidance from the MoEYS on how to meet standards. Preschool programmes also need step-by-
step, practical guidance on how they can work towards meeting standards.
6.5. Curriculum
A strength of Timor-Leste’s preschool system is the fact that it has a developmentally
appropriate preschool curriculum. However, some preschools still use the old curriculum, and
socialization is needed to address this lag. Preschool educators often did not have all the
teaching and learning materials they needed to implement the curriculum as planned but were
able to use locally available materials to fill the gaps at least partially. There was confusion on
the part of preschool educators regarding the use of first-language instruction (versus Tetum)
when delivering the curriculum.
Timor-Leste does not currently engage in routine monitoring or evaluation of school readiness,
so the country cannot be certain of the extent to which delivery of the curriculum as planned
results in school readiness (in alignment with expectations for students entering Grade 1).
Grade 1 repetition rates also provide important information about school readiness, but (as
69 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
noted above in Section 6.4), Timor-Leste does not currently have reliable EMIS data on this
topic. There were mixed findings regarding the extent to which stakeholders used the
information that was available to assess the effectiveness of preschool programming in this
way.
6.6. Family and Community Engagement
Timor-Leste’s education system recognises the importance of
family and community engagement in preschool education
(and of education more broadly). The country has several
policy directives around family engagement, but preschool
educators were unclear on how to put them into practice. The
family and community engagement that did take place was
heavily focused on encouraging families and communities to
contribute funds or labour to the preschool class.
Whilst there is nothing wrong with encouraging parents to
volunteer or asking the community to help provide resources
(such as materials and labour to build a new classroom),
stakeholders in the preschool subsector seemed unaware of
©UNICEF / BSoares
other important types of family and community engagement.
In particular, there was a lack of engagement with communities as partners to co-develop plans
that best meet the needs of the children, or strengths-based engagement with families to plan
how to meet individual children’s holistic needs. This type of family and community
engagement may have been happening in some preschool programmes, but it was not part of
business as usual overall.
7. Lessons Learned
In the course of this study, the AIR evaluation team learned four lessons with broader
applications:
1. For preschool education to be sustainable, it’s important that it is viewed as a common
good by the general population (as they view basic education). Usually, countries first need
to convince the population that it is a common good; then it can be integrated into the
larger education system. The evaluation team learned that even if preschool education has
already been brought under the umbrella of basic education (as in Timor-Leste), that step
alone does not automatically ensure public understanding of it as a public good. More
advocacy may still be needed.
70 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
2. Even if a country has multiple partners engaged in promoting preschool education, and
those organisations share similar goals, it is still critical to have formal mechanisms for
coordination and collaboration. These mechanisms can help ensure that their efforts are
efficient, such as through identification of gaps and overlaps, and leveraging of one
another’s activities and investments.
3. Many countries rely on volunteers and/or untrained teachers to fill substantial human
resource gaps in their preschool subsectors. It is important to address this issue through
two simultaneous approaches: building up the skills of the workforce that is available now
and in the short term, whilst working to increase the number of trained preschool teachers
over the longer term.
4. Family and community engagement is critical for effective preschool education, but
countries may just focus on what families and communities can provide (such as funds or
labour) and the presence of a parent-teacher association. Preschool stakeholders at all
levels need guidance to help them understand that families and community engagement is
more effective when families and communities are also respected as capable partners who
can collaborate in planning with educators towards meeting children’s needs.
8. Recommendations
The evaluation team formulated 12 recommendations based on a combination of (1) direct
input from stakeholders in the course of interviews, and (2) review of the evaluation data
across sources to identify actionable areas of need or gaps.
Recommendation 1 (planning) is of the highest priority, as it sets the stage for all of the
remaining recommendations. Recommendation 2 (financing) is the second highest priority, as
financing is required to facilitate execution of the other recommendations. The planning and
financing recommendations are inter-related, because effective financing decisions require a
comprehensive costed plan, while at the same time step-by-step planning needs to be realistic
based on the resources the government can allocate (in addition to what partners could
provide. The remaining 10 recommendations do not need to be carried out in a specific order,
and their prioritization and sequencing should be determined in the course of planning (as per
Recommendation 1).
Recommendation 1: Develop a comprehensive national plan. The best thing that Timor-Leste
can do for its preschool subsector is to create a coherent, unified plan for development in the
coming years. This plan should cover all key aspects of the preschool system, indicate short-,
medium- and long-term targets that are based on a realistic assessment of what can be
71 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
accomplished, define step by step how the country will move towards these targets (with
costed activities), and specify the roles and responsibilities of all the actors in the subsector
towards carrying out those steps. The plan should reflect progressive universalisation in the
provision of quality preschool education for all children in Timor-Leste. This plan should address
the entire preschool system with all actors, not just those aspects under the oversight of the
government and a few key partners. This plan needs to include monitoring and evaluation so
that stakeholders can verify that the correct approaches are being taken. If done well, the plan
should endure regardless of changes in government or NGO staff. This activity should be carried
out as promptly as is feasible and should involve the MoEYS plus all of the other actors in the
subsector. This is the kind of activity that UNICEF or HANDS would be well positioned to
facilitate (or the ECD Working Group, if it is relaunched), but the MoEYS should be viewed as a
strong leader in this activity.
Recommendation 2: Improve financing. Timor-Leste needs to change its approach to financing
preschool education. The country lacks stable and adequate financing for preschool.
Development of the subsector plan (as specified in Recommendation 1) can help the MoEYS
and partners (1) project what level of funding will be needed and when, (2) identify which
activities should be prioritised based on limited resources, (3) advocate for funding from donors
and (4) create efficiencies in the system. The MoEYS will need to take the lead in rethinking
funding, with support from whatever partners it believes will be helpful. This activity should be
a priority.
Recommendation 3: Improve the EMIS. The MoEYS should work to improve the timeliness and
quality of preschool sector EMIS data to facilitate planning and oversight. In addition, the
MoEYS should expand its EMIS to comprehensively cover both public and private preschool
programming (perhaps by adding reporting requirements for NGOs operating programming, in
relation to Recommendation 7 below). These efforts are critical for the MoEYS and partners to
be able to engage in data-driven planning – both as the system operates now, and if
Recommendations 1 and or 2 are implemented.
Recommendation 4: Develop the workforce. Timor-Leste will need to determine how to
simultaneously build the skills of the largely untrained preschool workforce it has now, whilst
working towards increasing the size of its workforce overall (including skilled teachers as well as
teacher trainers). The country needs a national teacher recruitment and training strategy, and a
standardized approach and curriculum to ensure uniform teacher preparation to use best
practices. In addition, Timor-Leste would benefit from taking an inventory of its existing teacher
training models for unqualified staff. The inventory should capture their relative effectiveness,
cost-effectiveness, feasibility of scaling, and whether the entity that offers that model would be
willing to make it freely available (and perhaps conduct a training-of-trainers workshop for
72 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
other organisations). Then the country can standardise and promote that specific model. This
approach will help ensure that investments in teacher training are using the best practices for
Timor-Leste, and will also help the subsector overall with a consistency of approach to
professional development for unqualified or volunteer teachers. Finally, staff who oversee and
support preschool education at the national level (such as at the MoEYS and INFORDEPE) and
school level (such as school inspectors and school principals) need training in developmentally
appropriate practice for preschool level. The INFORDEPE should take the lead on this activity.
Recommendation 5: Determine
how best to build upon the
diversity of preschool delivery
models in use. The country
already has a broad selection of
preschool models that are in use.
It is important for the MoEYS and
stakeholders to have a good
understanding of what these
models are, what resources they
require, how effective they are,
©UNICEF / NSoares
and where they are best suited to
work (given the diversity of contexts found across the country). A national study is required to
capture this information and allow for the side-by-side comparison of different models. This
activity could take place as part of the planning described in Recommendation 1, so that it
informs good decision-making around programming. The activity could be carried out by the
MoEYS or by one of the other subsector stakeholders in the country.
Recommendation 6: Customise standards for preschool. Timor-Leste’s standards for basic
schools should have a tailored module for the preschool class that reflects developmentally
appropriate practice. For example, teachers should primarily use play-based and hands-on
learning; they should not expect children to sit at desks for long periods. With more
developmentally appropriate standards, school inspectors will be able to assess the extent to
which observe quality education at the preschool level (and can encourage preschool educators
to use these practices). NGOs and others that provide programming can also be encouraged or
required to meet standards. The INFORDEPE should be able to take on this task in collaboration
with the MoEYS.
Recommendation 7: Help programmes know how to improve. Preschool programmes need
guidance on how to work towards meeting standards (and if Recommendation 4 is
implemented first, these standards will be more aligned with developmentally appropriate
73 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
practice). It is important that this guidance takes into consideration that some programmes
may start far below standards, and gives practical recommendations about how improvements
can be made step by step. It is also important that this guidance provides low-cost and feasible
options where some requirements may seem costly or out of reach to programme staff. This
activity could be completed in conjunction with Recommendation 4.
Recommendation 8: Establish ECD working groups at the municipal levels. ECD working
groups should be established at the municipal level, to foster coordination within the subsector
as well as promote cross-sector collaboration towards promoting child and family wellbeing.
The working groups should include municipal education authorities, partners, the MoEYS, and
representatives from other child- and family-serving systems. The activity could be carried out
by the MoEYS or by one of the other subsector stakeholders in the country.
Recommendation 9: Require registration of preschools at the national and/or municipal level.
There should be a legal requirement for all preschool programming and activities to be
registered with and approved by the MoEYS and/or municipal government. The government
needs the authority over preschool programming, including the activities of NGOs working in
the subsector. This legal requirement should be implemented by the MoEYS at the time of its
choosing, and NGOs should be involved in helping ensure that registration and oversight
processes are developed to be feasible and efficient to comply with.
Recommendation 10: Provide guidance on first-language instruction. Because first-language
instruction best promotes student learning104 and educators in this study were unclear about
Timor-Leste’s language-of-instruction policies for preschool, the MoEYS should provide
preschool programmes with guidance regarding the use of first-language instruction, and
should work to ensure that preschool programmes all have the basic materials they need to
carry out the preschool curriculum. This activity can be carried out when feasible – either as
part of the broader subsector plan defined in Recommendation 1 or as a specific activity in the
absence of this larger plan. Many NGOs in Timor-Leste have expertise in best practices in first-
language instruction and in the creation of low-cost teaching and learning materials. These
NGOs could either carry out this activity directly or work with the MoEYS so the MoEYS can do
so.
Recommendation 11: Broaden ideas about family and community engagement. Timor-Leste’s
preschool subsector needs to broaden its understanding of family and community engagement
beyond simply asking families and communities to provide resources. Preschool programmes

need to know how to engage communities as equal partners
©UNICEF / BSoares
with shared responsibility for meeting the needs of children and
families. For example, the school and community can discuss
how to address mutual concerns (such as poor child nutrition or
the need for clean drinking water at the school) through joint
efforts. And preschool educators also need to know how to
engage individual families in a way that recognises each family’s
strengths, builds mutual trust and good communication, and
gets families and educators working together to help each child
thrive. The MoEYS is well positioned to lead this work with
support from other actors in the subsector who have experience
in carrying out similar activities.
Recommendation 12: Provide preschool education to children
with disabilities. The country lacks a strategy for meeting the educational needs of preschool
children with disabilities, and there is limited information available regarding how many
children have disabilities and what their needs are. Timor-Leste should carry out a situational
analysis study of education for children with disabilities (which could include a larger age span
that just preschool age). The study should consider the needs of the children, as well as how
educators and programmes can best be prepared to serve these children. This situational
analysis is a necessary first step towards planning for the inclusion of children with disabilities in
the education sector. The MoEYS should work with other actors in the sector to secure funding
and determine the best organisation to carry out this study.
There is a wealth of recent guidance on best practices for carrying out these recommendations.

Annex A: Terms of Reference
EVALUATION OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION IN TIMOR-LESTE
Concept Note
Background and Rationale
Timor-Leste is a small island nation, and with the restoration of its independence in 2002, it is
also one of the world’s youngest countries. It has a population of 1.293 million109, of whom
69 per cent live in rural areas and 44.5 per cent are aged under 18. The 10- to 24-year-old age
group accounts for one third of the population,110 with a potential for demographic dividend if
the fertility rates continue to decline. Whilst Timor-Leste benefited from high levels of
economic growth until 2016, prolonged political uncertainty and high dependence on rapidly
reducing oil revenue is hindering the country’s economic development. Poverty levels have
declined but remain high, particularly for children in rural areas but also for poor children in
urban areas. Access to social services has significantly improved, but inequality in access
remains a concern, especially for persons living with disabilities, rural communities and
children, women and young people from socially marginalised and poor households.
Access to education has improved significantly, with a primary NER of 89 per cent in 2018 (girls
93/boys 86) compared to 64 per cent in 2005.111 Challenges remain in the quality of education,
lack of safe water and sanitation at schools, which disproportionately affects girls, and high
repetition rates. The preschool GER was 21 per cent in 2018, far behind the national target of
50 per cent by 2024.112
Despite global evidence on the importance of early childhood education,113 the number of
students attending preschool is still low, with only 22 per cent of children in Timor-Leste are
enrolled in preschools as of 2017.114 Preschool is integral in ensuring that children arrive in
primary school ready to learn and can expect to achieve genuine learning whilst at school.
Getting more students into preschool at the appropriate age is essential to promote school
readiness and avert high repetition rates and student dropouts. In 2017, 33 per cent of children
were participating in some form of organised early childhood education or learning activity in
109 United Nations population projection figures for 2019.

the one year before the official primary age.115 However, according to the EMIS education data,
which does not include community-run schools, access to preschool education is much lower,
covering only 21.6 per cent of three- to five-year-old children in 2018. High repetition rate
(23.9 per cent) and dropout rate (5.57 per cent) in Grade 1116 suggest poor school readiness.
Nearly 40 per cent (39.1 per cent) of all children 5 and 6 years old are not in either preschool or
primary schools.117 However, attendance of girls is slightly higher than boys. These figures
include wide variations in GER between municipalities with Manufahi at 38 per cent and Baucau
at 10 per cent and a total of five districts in the country have GER below 20 per cent.
The National Education Strategic Plan (NESP) 2011–2030118 identifies preschool as a priority for
education, with a target of achieving a preschool NER of 50 per cent for 3 to 5-year-olds by
2015 and 100 per cent by 2030.119 The 2015 target was missed with preschool NER at
14.3 per cent.120 The 2012 Policy Framework for Preschool Education states that “Timor-Leste’s
vision for preschool education is to provide all children between 3-5 years of age access to a
quality preschool programme close to their home.” The policy framework outlines five strategic
focus areas to support the achievement of the government’s vision for preschool education in
Timor-Leste. These are:
• Expand the availability of quality preschool education
• Increase the training and ongoing professional development of preschool educators
• Support curriculum development
• Development of family and community partnerships
• Development of a standards-based monitoring and evaluation system.
The five strategic areas emerged from a set of contextual issues and the recognition that early
childhood education involves a multisectoral and multidimensional approaches to ensure
children are equipped with the necessary knowledge, skills and services to guarantee their full
potential. Relevance of preschool education as an important stage of development that builds
foundation for later development is less understood by both the general public as well as key
decision-makers in the country. The involvement and empowerment of local communities and
families as active partners in the policy discourse is an important aspect of galvanising support
for improving access to preschool education and quality of learning. A lack of ownership by

communities, for example, can lead to poor maintenance and support of government and
donor supported facilities. The importance of family and community partnerships in early
childhood education is underscored by a United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)-supported
longitudinal study that assessed how access to preschool education with parenting education
support contributes children’s nutritional status, school readiness, early grade learning and
progress through basic school.121 The phase 1 findings found that the community preschools
group had performed better on overall school readiness scores compared to the other-early
childhood education (ECE) and no-ECE groups. Children in community preschool aldeias had
better performance in emergent language and literacy; health, hygiene and safety; and cultural
participation.
The development of a National Policy for Early Childhood Development (ECD) is another
important step by the government in improving preschool education in Timor-Leste (the draft
ECD policy is yet to be approved by the Council of Ministers). The MoEYS is prioritising early
childhood education and is investing in the construction, rehabilitation, and accreditation of
preschools as a key priority. Currently there is a ratio of 1 teacher for 32 children at
preschool.122 One option being considered to expedite the planned growth of preschool
education is to use alternative delivery modes, such as community-based preschools. In 2019,
3,581 children (1,830 boys and 1,751 girls) were enrolled in UNICEF-supported community-
based preschools in Ermera and Viqueque Municipalities. Despite its short history of
implementation since 2017, that is limited to only two municipalities for modelling purposes,
the community preschool enrolment represents a little over 3 per cent of national enrolment.
In the two municipalities, they represent a 14 per cent increase in enrolment for Ermera and
23 per cent increase in Viqueque raising their enrolment well above the national GER of 25 per
cent in 2018. A recent cost analysis shows that community-based preschools on average have
an operating cost of $43 per child as compared to $287 in a standard public preschool; and an
average set-up cost of about $48 per child compared to $697 for a standard public preschool
(insert reference). Based on data collected in 2018 at the start of primary school in schools
where children who attended community preschools as part of a study to track their
performance in early years of primary school suggest that children coming from community
preschools performed relatively better than their counterparts as measured by the East Asia
Pacific Early Childhood Development scale (EAP-ECDS). The average score for children from
community preschools was 58.4 compared to 53 for those coming from other preschools
(public or private) and 51.8 for those who had no preschool background. The model mobilises
community resources such as spaces for learning and volunteers as facilitators, and uses

Strengthening of the early childhood education system is an important goal of the MoEYS and
key stakeholders in the preschool subsector. This will require accelerating access to quality
preschool education and promoting school readiness to learn through addressing the supply-
side and demand-side bottlenecks and challenges in the subsector.
Purpose, Objectives, Audience and Expected Use
This is a formative evaluation to generate evidence and learning from the implementation and
results of the early childhood education initiatives in Timor-Leste. The evidence will be used to
inform decision making on programme design and implementation of the preschool subsector
and on early childhood development, including cross-sectoral linkages. The evaluation will also
inform the government of Timor-Leste early childhood education national policies and budgets
and UNICEF’s strategic position in early childhood education in the country.
The evaluation objectives are:
1. Develop a theory of change (ToC) to capture the causal pathways towards increasing
equitable access to quality early childhood education in Timor-Leste. The ToC will be
developed based on the review of the literature on childhood education programming and
contributions from key stakeholders, in close consultation with the ERG. The ToC will
provide a theoretical framework of activities, outputs and outcomes that will form the basis
for evaluating the overall programme of early childhood education activities in Timor-Leste.
2. Assess the relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability of the early
childhood education policy and programmes in Timor-Leste.
3. Identify lessons learned and make recommendations that can be used by the government
of Timor-Leste, UNICEF and other key partners to inform decision making on policy and
programme design and implementation of the preschool subsector and on early childhood
development, including cross-sectoral linkages in the country.
The primary audience for this formative evaluation is the Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports
(MoEYS), municipal and local authorities, UNICEF and other development partners involved in
the provision of preschool education such as the government of New Zealand (who fund the
public preschool programme). The secondary audience is other United Nations agencies and
123 SEL preschool pilot, UNICEF, 2016
80 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
development partners, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), community service
organisations (CSOs), faith-based organisations and private sector.
The proposed country-led evaluation seeks to generate evidence to inform the discussions and
plans by the MoEYS and UNICEF to create an enabling environment for accessible, quality and
sustainable opportunities for early childhood education in Timor-Leste. It is expected that the
evaluation will build on the findings and lessons from the UNICEF-supported longitudinal study
on the effects of preschool education with parenting education support.
Scope of Evaluation
The formative evaluation will cover the period from 2012 to 2020 and will assess the
approaches to implementing ECE and the extent to which they increase equitable access to
preschool opportunities and their contribution to readiness to learn in formal schooling.
Building on findings and lessons from previous studies in Timor-Leste and guided by the Global
Partnership for Education’s Better Early Learning framework, the evaluation will examine the
strategies and approaches for strengthening the ECE system to ensure quality, equitable, and
sustainable services. The evaluation will examine to what extent the ECE programmes are
linked to other multisectoral interventions across the domains of health, nutrition, education
and social protection. The evaluation will look at ECE initiatives of the government and its
development partners – it will not be restricted to UNICEF ECE interventions.
The geographic scope of the formative evaluation is the national and subnational levels. At the
subnational level, a sample from the 13 municipalities in Timor-Leste will be selected for
inclusion in the evaluation. The final list of municipalities will be discussed and agreed with
Evaluation Reference Group that will comprise members from MoEYS, UNICEF and other key
partners.
Evaluation Criteria and Questions
The evaluation will focus on (1) relevance, (2) coherence, (3i) effectiveness, (4) efficiency, and
(5) sustainability of the ECE approaches and programmes with gender, equity, and human rights
considerations.
Below are the preliminary evaluation questions which will be finalised during the inception
phase. They can be commented on and adjusted by the bidders in their technical proposals.

key indicators, data collection methods, means of verification and source of information will be
developed by the selected evaluation team as part of the inception phase. The preliminary
evaluation questions can be prioritised and modified by the evaluation team during the
inception phase based on the evaluability of the evaluation object and each evaluation
question. The proposed priorities and modifications of evaluation questions needs to be agreed
with MoEYS and UNICEF.
83 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
Evaluation Design and Methodology
The evaluation will be a non-experimental and utilisation-focused evaluation adopting theory-
based and mixed-methods approaches. Evidence will be collected primarily through extensive
desk review of documents and data already available, complemented by information gathered
directly from key stakeholders at national and local levels through key informant interviews,
focus group discussions, and other appropriate means. Considering the health risks of the
COVID-19 pandemic, it is expected that all primary data collection will be conducted remotely.
To strengthen the data collection process, it is expected the evaluation team will use a local
partner (for example, Universidade Nacional Timor Lorosa’e).
Findings, conclusions, and recommendations should be based on triangulated evidence. Three
types of triangulation methods could be adopted: 1) cross-reference of different data sources
(from interviews, FGDs, and review of documents); 2) investigator triangulation through the
deployment of multiple evaluators; and 3) review by participants through the respondents’
validation meetings and consultation with government and UNICEF key respondents during the
report drafting process. The triangulation efforts will be tested for consistency of results, noting
that inconsistencies do not necessarily weaken the credibility of results, but may reflect the
sensitivity of different types of data collection methods. This is to ensure validity, establish
common threads and trends, and identify divergent views.
The evaluation design and methodology including the necessary data collection, sampling
strategy and selection criteria, and limitations and mitigation measures shall be further
developed and improved by the bidders in their respective proposals. Alternative approaches
can also be proposed. This will be further specified and finalised by the selected evaluation
team in collaboration with UNICEF and the Evaluation Reference Group during the inception
phase.
The evaluation will follow the UNEG Norms and Standards for Evaluations as well as UNICEF
Procedure for Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation, Data Collection and Analysis and UNEG
Ethical Guidelines for Evaluation. It also have to consider UNEG Guidance on integrating Human
Rights and Gender Equality in Evaluation and UN-SWAP Evaluation Performance Indicators. The
final evaluation report will need to be compliant with UNICEF-Adapted UNEG Evaluation
Reports standards and UNICEF- Global Evaluation Reports Oversight System (GEROS) review
criteria.
Special measures will be put in place to ensure that the evaluation process is ethical and that
the participants in the evaluation process can openly express their opinion. The sources of
information will be protected and known only to the evaluator(s). The Evaluation Team will
ensure that the evaluation process is in line with UNEG Ethical Guidelines, i.e. ensuring ethical
84 | Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste
conduct in data generation will be imperative. Specific attention should be paid to issues
specifically relating to:
• Harm and benefits;
• Informed consent;
• Privacy and confidentiality; and
• Conflict of interest of the evaluation informants.
Consequently, the Evaluation Team has to ensure that it is clear to all subjects that their
participation in the evaluation is voluntary. All participants should be informed or advised of
the context and purpose of the evaluation, as well as the privacy and confidentiality of the
discussions.

Annex D: Interview and Focus Group Protocols
Introduction and Informed Consent (used at the beginning of each tool)
Hello, my name is …......... and I am a researcher working with the American
Institutes for Research (AIR) to conduct an independent evaluation of the
preschool education sector in Timor-Leste. The MOEYS has commissioned this
study through UNICEF to learn about the systems in place to support preschool
education in the country.
I would like to conduct an interview with you to learn more about your knowledge
of the preschool education sector. It should take about one hour. These questions
are not about you personally and are not intended to judge you or your
organisation. Rather, they are intended to provide more information to support the
future development of the preschool education sector. If you do not know or do
not want to answer any question, that is fine. You are not required to answer any
questions.
We will not use your name in any reports and will make efforts to ensure that your
responses are confidential. However, it is possible that a reader could determine
that you were the source of information based on your organisation and/or
position. We therefore cannot promise that your responses will be completely
confidential.
If you agree, I would like to record the interview to fill in my notes. The recording
will not be shared with anyone outside of AIR.
Do you have any questions before we begin?
Do I have your permission to audio record? [If agreed, begin recording.]
