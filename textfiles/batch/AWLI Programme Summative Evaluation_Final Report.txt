EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This UNICEF-commissioned Summative Evaluation of the Afghan Women’s Leadership Initiative in Support
for Adolescent Girls (AWLI) in Afghanistan covered programme implementation from 2015 through 2020.
The AWLI programme was originally a three-year programme, from 30 September 2015 through September
2018 and had a budget of USD 6,949,735.23. However, the programme underwent a no cost extension,
which essentially resulted in a five-year implementation period.
The programme objectives were to:
 Change perceptions on the acceptability of early and forced marriage and mobilize communities to
delay marriage by raising awareness of adolescent girls’ rights, the laws in place to protect them, the
negative consequences of early marriage, and the importance of educating girls;
 Empower adolescent girls to make informed life choices through education, vocational and life skills
training, and peer support networks; and
 Map and document the status of adolescent girls in Afghanistan.
In response to the Pandemic, a fourth objective was added, “to provide key supplies to adolescent girls
affected by COVID-19 to prepare them to return to schools when schools are reopened and to have
continued access and quality education. The AWLI programme completed all implementation on 31
December 2020.
AWLI’s outreach extended to five provinces, (1) Nangahar, (2) Samangan; (3) Ghor; (4) Herat; and (5)
Farah, and within each province, four districts were prioritized (totaling 20 districts). The AWLI programme
delivered an ambitious range of seven interventions designed to reach the most vulnerable adolescent girls.
They include: 1. Community Dialogues; 2. Reflect Circles; 3. Safe Spaces and formal and informal
networks; 4. Mini Media Clubs; and 5. Community-Based Life Skills Training (for girls only). A sixth
intervention, Unconditional Cash Grant, and a seventh activity, Community-Based Livelihood Training for
adolescent girls, were only undertaken in Herat and Samangan provinces, respectively. Through a
Programme Cooperation Agreement with ActionAid, and a Consortium of three different non-governmental
organizations, Empowerment Centre for Women, the Organisation for Humanitarian Welfare, and Women
Activities and Social Services Association, the UNICEF Afghanistan Country Office (ACO) effectively
leveraged their influence, innovations, and expertise to realize women and children’s rights in Afghanistan.
EVALUATION PURPOSE & OBJECTIVES
As per the Terms of Reference (ToR), the purpose of this evaluation is to contribute to:
(i) evidence-based and risk-informed programming on increasing access of out-of-school (OoS)
adolescent girls to secondary education;
(ii) programming on changing societal perceptions about: (a) child marriage practices; and (b) girls’
empowerment in Afghanistan; and
(iii) institutional learning about the complex relationships linking financial incentives, education, and
perceptions on child marriage/girls’ empowerment.
As there is limited global evidence connecting these variables (i.e., school attendance, perceptions on child
marriage, and girl’s empowerment), the results from this evaluation are also expected to add value to the
global movements to end child marriage and promote girl’s education.
9
This summative evaluation’s objectives are to:
 Measure the relevance, effectiveness, cohesion, efficiency, sustainability and impact of the AWLI
programme in regard to increasing school enrolment of adolescent girls and stimulating social
behaviour change related to perceptions of child marriage and girls’ empowerment; and
 Identify [and confirm] gaps in the programme results chain/Theory of Change (ToC), lessons learned,
and provide recommendations on how to design, implement, and scale up similar programmes in the
rest of Afghanistan.
The intended audience is UNICEF, the United States Government (Secretary’s Office of Global Women’s
Issues), and practitioners dedicated to the movement to end early marriage.
EVALUATION METHODOLOGY
This evaluation employs a combination of a theory-driven approach and utilization-focused approach and
relies heavily on a ToC in order to understand better the degree to which programme participants have
been impacted by the programme. The overall design of this study is mixed methods, leveraging both
qualitative and quantitative evidence to answer the Key Evaluation Questions (KEQs) (see below). The
main information sources collected and used were:
1. Documents which included pre-existing qualitative and quantitative information based on the existing
logframe activity, outputs, and baseline data;
2. Primary data from key informant interviews (KIIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) at community
levels; and
3. Existing M&E data, including Post Distribution Monitoring and UNICEF’s Results Assessment Module.
The Team Leader traveled to Afghanistan and consulted with stakeholders (n=54), and roughly a one-half
of the sample was female. Although the programme covers five provinces, only three, provinces
were selected for primary data collection, including Herat, Nangarhar, and Samangan. Nine districts were
sampled with a total of 162 persons interviewed and an additional 11 people from focus group discussions
with Implementing Partners (IPs). The entire sample is 67% female.
KEY EVALUATION QUESTIONS
The evaluation adhered to the OECD-DAC evaluation criteria and therefore responded to the following
questions:

Findings
Relevance
AWLI’s design emanates from an evidence-based assessment of national priorities at the provincial levels,
regional research trends, and a thorough alignment with both national strategies and UNICEF’s Strategic & Action
Plans. Frequently, prevention programmes which seek to fulfill a gender inequality goal isolate women and girls
and fail to recognize the interconnected nature of the linkages among gender inequality, limited access to
education, and small enterprise. However, AWLI is unique, in that it applied a multi-sectoral approach to promote
girls’ education and reduce early marriage by recognizing the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious
drivers of child marriage. It also targeted the needs of vulnerable, out of school girls in conflict and hard-to-reach
contexts with the promotion of education. Findings illustrate, however, that AWLI could have been more inclusive,
focusing on girls and boys, as the inclusion of men and boys tends to result in greater programme sustainability
with longer lasting behavior change.

and behaviour change at the community level (see text box).
While it is recognized that Community-based Livelihood Training was only implemented in Samangan, and
Unconditional Cash Grants were only distributed in Herat, the Mini Media Clubs, Safe Spaces, Community-based
Life Skills Training were implemented equally to all provinces. The uptake, however, varied remarkably in each
province. For example, in Samangan, the adolescent girls who were exposed to “tailoring” through the
Community-based Livelihood Training continue to engage in this activity. All recipients of an Unconditional Cash
Grant reported spending funds on education, although some mentioned spending funds on other items. The Mini
Media Clubs also had good uptake, as IP service providers in Nangahar and Herat noted that the children share
the messages discussed at the club with their families when they go back home. The use of Safe Space facilities
was variable. For example, in Samangan and Nangahar, the communities in these provinces are more traditional,
and so the Safe Spaces, functioned more like venues for awareness raising meetings. The demand for the Safe
Space services in Herat, however, exceeded supply. Through the Community-based Life Skills Training,
programme participants were exposed to hygiene practices, and, unlike the other provinces a set of beneficiaries
in Samangan opened as small shop which sells hygiene products and offers consultations to women. Finally,
several factors limited the effective delivery of programme services, including: (1) partner capacity limitations; (2)
government policies on Community -based Livelihood Training; and (3) insecurity.
Efficiency
In spite of established procedures and practices guiding implementation processes, it was noted that there were
multiple changes in key leadership positions within UNICEF Afghanistan. The ACO is categorized as a Non-Family
Duty Station, which means that staff are allowed Rest and Recuperation (R&R) travel to support a work-life
balance. Evaluation findings indicate that there were three different country representatives over five years and
three different AWLI programme managers during the same period. The change in leadership adversely affected
the efficiency of programme management. Other factors hindering the efficient delivery of outputs and reducing
the programme’s ability to fully meet its targets included: (1) capacity limitations of the consultants who
experienced significant challenges conducting the baseline assessment, and (2) movement restrictions linked to
the Pandemic. Moreover, though monitoring data was gender disaggregated, some data was not consistently
separated by age, which is a critical gap when managing a programme that focuses on adolescents. UNICEF
has used a mix of strategies to implement AWLI, and one of the most cost-efficient ones was during the Pandemic.
Findings show that the procurement of recreation and hygiene kits and handwashing stations (the fourth objective)
was successful, as this component not only expended a preexisting surplus of funds, but it also exceeded the
planned target.
Sustainability
12
The Mini Media Clubs are embedded in government schools and are therefore under the management of the
government, this activity is not likely to be sustained due to the cessation of instruction because of the Pandemic.
Similarly, the Safe Spaces in Nangahar and Samangan are not likely to be sustained despite their management
by the Department of Woman’s Affairs, as they functioned like venues for other programme activities. While the
Community-based Livelihood Training had strong uptake in Samagan, the fact that there were challenges linked
to interpretations of government policy on Livelihood Training in general leads the evaluation to conclude that
this activity is also not likely to be sustainable. Finally, given the difficulties with Unconditional Cash Grants in
Ghor, it would be necessary for a comprehensive risk assessment in order to continue this intervention. Given
that this evaluation has found a positive response to the Community Dialogues, Reflect Circles, and Safe Spaces
(in Herat only), targeted funding could facilitate their future continuation. As the ACO’s Country Programme of
Cooperation (CPC) will be ending in 2021, there is a limited window in which to act before the new CPC begins.
Finally, regarding factors which facilitate or impede the scale-up of activities, the evaluation identified: (1)
government willingness; (2) community interest; and (3) IP capacity.
Coherence
A review of initiatives designed to reduce child marriage in Afghanistan yielded very limited information, but the
Global Programme to End Child Marriage is somewhat similar to AWLI’s structure. Further, it does not appear
that AWLI has any contradictions, and in fact findings indicate linkages and synergies with ongoing UNICEF
programmes in other sectors (i.e., education, gender, and WASH). Since AKF and UNICEF’s programmes are
located in different geographical areas, there is little duplication in the areas of girl’s education and empowerment.
However, the Adolescent Portfolio Evaluation observed duplications within UNICEF’s programmes, which could
be remedied with a ToC for adolescent programming. This insightful recommendation has already been included
in that report. 4
Impact5
The evidence shows that most interviewed have gained an awareness of (experienced a shift in mindfulness)
about the harmful effects of early marriage and discontinuing education, but this finding alone does not confirm
that there was necessarily an attitude change from the past compared to the present. Only a small number of
participants expressed that after experiencing the programme, their perspectives had changed. However, rights
holder young males and females and duty bearer parents experienced a raised awareness, through interpersonal
communications, and this [reportedly] led to taking some form of action. Specifically, there are countless
examples where participants spoke up and took the following action: (i) informed others of the harmful effects of
early marriage and discontinuing girls’ education; (ii) intervened in a planned marriage with and without success;
(iii) convinced a family member to let a girl continue her education. Indeed, this evidence confirms that some
stakeholders experienced or and observed changed attitudes within themselves or and their communities. As
this stakeholder group is action-oriented, they would make strong candidates to participate in the Reflect
Circles, in the event that this intervention were to be scaled up.
In spite of these encouraging observations, however, there is only a partial fulfillment of the intermediate outcomes
in the Theory of Change. Rights holder adolescents (ages 11-17) and Community and Religious Leaders appear
to be less action-oriented for different reasons. Adolescents are not intervening within the family dynamics of
others-either indirectly or directly, because they may be still in the process of developing an opinion and may have
not reached a point of exercising a choice regarding marriage or sexual and reproductive health. Community and
Religious Leaders take action and support the promotion of education for many girls, but there are only a few
examples where these stakeholders take action by using their power to hold others in the community to account

5 While the Impact Section presents data from multiple sources, it should be noted, however, that two KEQs could not be answered comprehensively, and they are “How
successful has the combination of social mobilization activities and cash transfers been on increasing secondary enrolment rates of adolescent girls and changing social
behaviour towards child marriage vis-à-vis social mobilization interventions alone?” and
13
for specifically early marriage. Given this conclusion, AWLI’s awareness raising components about the
harmful effects of child marriage and discontinuing education are, indeed, effective, but the evidence
does not support the programme contributed to the consistent delay in marriages. Apart from this gap, the
notion of whether a holistic and multisectoral approach is even a relevant one is still valid. As seen in the evidence,
AWLI attracted males and females.
Moreover, it has been evidenced that an Unconditional Cash Grant helps in purchasing education-related items,
but this may not translate into an increased ability to make life choices for the adolescent rights holder. Based on
evidence garnered, the circumstances are now distinct that a positive unintended effect was a severe reduction
of the dowery in Samangan, yet at the family level, there may be mounting pressures when there is drug addiction
or when the matriarch was a victim of early marriage, as she may perpetuate the cycle.
Lessons learned
A few lessons learned are:
 Multi-sectoral programmes help in advancing gender equality, as multiple groups (including men) become
attracted to and participated in AWLI.
 Highly skilled and motivated IPs work through initial community resistance by galvanizing male and female
community champions.
 Working with men (fathers and uncles) and boys (brothers and nephews) is critical, as they are also part
of social norms and harmful practices that limit women’s ability to make decisions about education, health,
livelihood resources.
 The context is an important factor when developing programmes to reduce early marriage, promote girl’s
education, and support women’s empowerment. As seen the Safe Space in Herat could not keep up with
the demand, whereas in Samangan and Nangahar, the Safe Space was not taken up in the same fashion.
and
 Understanding the underlying requirements for carrying out RCTs helps to minimize costly errors in the
end.
 Given the suspension of the Unconditional Cash Grant component in Ghor, it is paramount that upcoming
programmes have a comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation strategy.
Key Recommendations
In accordance with the ToR, the recommendations are presented in the order of programme design,
implementation, and scale up of similar programmes in Afghanistan. However, it should be noted that the last
recommendation is time sensitive. Most of these are to be led by Deputy Representative, Adolescent
Programming Manager developing future proposals to support the development of adolescents, and the Gender
Advisor.
1. Design-Intended Population-Gender & Equity
Deliberate efforts should be made to focus on girls and boys in future adolescent programmes.
2. Implementation
For higher impact interventions, it is recommended to focus on older girls (aged 17 to 22). The findings have
indicated that they have a voice, which enables them to have an instrumental role (in Reflect Circles, community
engagement, and Social and Behaviour Change activities). Providing a nominal incentive to them would also
motivate them to engage with others.
To maintain efficiencies, UNICEF should position a programme which cuts across multiple sectors under a
supervisor who has a holistic and wide view of the ACO portfolio rather than a supervisor who is solely focused
on one or two sectors (e.g., education, health, child protection).
14
To support the establishment and maintenance of a robust management information system, develop stronger
cooperation in data sharing between UNICEF and IPs and ensure that sex- and age-disaggregated data collection
is consistent.
3. Scale Up
Prior to pursuing scaling up or continuing these recommended interventions, position UNICEF to strategically
examine needs, including but not limited to:
(1) what would entail the expanded/continued coverage;
(2) what would be the contributions from the government partners’ limited infrastructure and capacity to adopt the
initiative;
(3) whether the models for Community Dialogues, Reflect Circles, and Safe Spaces should be further tested,
perhaps adding other components to the existing models; and
(4) potential weaknesses and threats that might have negative (or unplanned) impact as a result of scaling up of
these activities.

SECTION A
A. BACKGROUND
A.1 Description of the Programme & Key Milestones
The AWLI programme, with a budget of USD 6,949,735.23, was a three-year programme but was executed over
five years. Specifically, the programme was originally to be implemented from 30 September 2015 through
September 2018. However, the programme underwent a no cost extension (NCE), approved on 20-Feb-2018,
which extended it into the second quarter of 2020. When AWLI was first approved, the Country Office was
implementing its 2015-2019 Country Programme of Cooperation (CPC)6 and was effectively engaging with the
relevant ministries, at the central, provincial and district levels in the areas of Health, Nutrition, Education, Water,
Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), Child Protection, and Social Inclusion.7 There were five zonal offices and eight
outposts, and several modalities were used that supported and focused on adolescents.8 During this time,
significant efforts were undertaken to advance girl's education through the establishment of 2,504 new community-
based schools, and accelerated learning centres (ALCs) (and support to 2,676 existing community-based
education centers) in 18 provinces.9 It was within this context that the AWLI began with the overall goal of
“accelerating actions to enable adolescent girls to fully enjoy their childhood and adolescence free from the risk
of marriage; experience healthier, safe and more empowered life transitions in control of their own destiny,
including decisions about their health lifestyles, relationship formation, marriage and child-bearing, by engaging
key actors, including adolescents and young people.”10
Three inter-related programme objectives were intended to be carried out in synergy with other UNICEF
programmes focused on health, nutrition, education and child protection. They were:
 Objective 1: By end of 2018, elders, parents and influential individuals, including religious leaders in 20
districts of five provinces are equipped with skills and information for increased social action, acceptance,
visibility for supporting adolescents and generating shifts in social expectations relating to girls, including
through community dialogue, appreciative enquiry and community-based networks;
 Objective 2: By end of 2018, government and non-government providers in 20 districts and five provinces
are equipped with skills and information to promote access to basic social services with emphasis on life-skills
education, sports for development and safe spaces for youth clubs/federations; and
 Objective 3: Increased generation and use of real-time data and information using innovative methodologies
on adolescent girls and boys for a range of sectors including health, nutrition, education, child protection for
advocacy, programming, learning and tracking progress. 11

AWLI’s outreach extended to five provinces, (1) Nangahar, Figure 1: Map of programme provinces in Afghanistan.
(2) Samangan; (3) Ghor; (4) Herat; and (5) Farah, and their
selection was based on evidence secured from the 2007–
2008 and 2011–2012 National Risk and Vulnerability
Assessment (NRVA). Within each province, four districts Samangan
were prioritized, totaling 20 districts, and these districts were
in some of the most-deprived and remote areas, where the
prevalence of child marriage was the highest.12 Briefly, the
activities under each objective included: (a) community Herat Nangahar
dialogues; (b) training community leaders, Maliks, religious Ghor
leaders; (c) pre-marriage/marriage and post-marriage

support to young couples; (d) establishing youth/adolescent

activities; (f) establishing safe spaces and literacy support;
(g) vocational training; (h) developing Shura Action plans;
and (i) systematic documentation and lessons learned
designed to help in influencing advocacy for scaling up,
including with government and other donors.
In the Donor Report, covering activities from January 31st 2017 to June 1st 2017, UNICEF requested an adjustment
due to “a delayed start of actual implementation” (page 10). In early 2018, the Afghanistan Country Office (ACO)
embarked upon a redesign of the approach for implementation, “focusing on better linkages between various
intervention types (i.e., community mobilization, education interventions, Unconditional Cash Grants, and
research and data.)”13 To facilitate this process, UNICEF staff from the Regional Office, the provincial offices,
and Kabul undertook a comprehensive review process to ensure a more rigorous method of achieving and
measuring results for reducing child marriage and education promotion.14 The result from this review was a shift
in programme design from a service delivery approach to a community engagement practice. With this
programmatic shift, UNICEF created a new partnership with the ActionAid Consortium,15 which included ActionAid
Afghanistan (AAA) as the lead implementing partner, working together with (i) Empowerment Centre for Women
(ECW); (ii) Organisation for Humanitarian Welfare (OHW); and (iii) Women Activities and Social Services
Association (WASSA). These implementing partners specialized in gender equality concerns and were already
working in the five provinces and also in some of the pre-selected 20 districts. The revised programme
objectives were:
 Revised objective 1: Change perceptions on the acceptability of early and forced marriage and mobilize
communities to delay marriage by raising awareness of adolescent girls’ rights, the laws in place to protect
them, the negative consequences of early marriage, and the importance of educating girls;
 Revised objective 2: Empower adolescent girls to make informed life choices through education, vocational
and life skills training, and peer support networks; and
 Revised objective 3: Map and document the status of adolescent girls in Afghanistan.

As a response to insecurity, the limited implementing partner’s (IP) access to targeted communities, natural
disasters, the effects of COVID-19 Pandemic in 2019, the Country Office sought solutions by requesting re-
programming. It was within this context that a second adjustment, issued on 17 July 2020, was extended to the
programme up through 31 December 2020. With this reprogramming, new objective 4 was added, which was
“to provide key supplies to adolescent girls affected by COVID-19 to prepare them to return to schools/CBEs when

schools are reopened and to have continued access and quality education.16 Under this new reprogramming,
there were a total of seven interventions designed to reach the most vulnerable adolescent girls in all 20 districts.17
They included:
1. Community Dialogues;
2. Reflect Circles;
3. Safe Spaces and Formal and Informal Networks;
4. Mini Media Clubs;
5. Community-based Life Skills Training;
6. Unconditional-Cash Grants; and
7. Community-based Livelihood Training.
Overall, these programme components aimed to improve participants’ knowledge and skills about the harmful
effects of discontinuing the education of adolescent girls and early marriage. By June 2019, the activities from
AWLI’s early phases were training 2,355 religious leaders about the consequences of child marriage based on
Sharia Law and Child Rights in Islam (85 Female religious scholars).18 Community Dialogue sessions, held in all
five provinces, reached 300,000 community members. Parents, teachers, religious leaders, community elders,
community shuras, youth, women rights activists as well as available members from female led organizations and
groups participated. For the second component, there were 157 facilitators who received training to actively
participate in the Reflect Circles.19 Prior to establishing Safe Spaces, the third component, Adolescent and Youth
Networks were established in the five provinces to enable young people, especially girls, to advocate for education
and put child marriage on the agenda in their province. During this time, the schools were being selected for the
establishment of mini-media clubs, the fourth component, which included the provision of equipment (tape
recorders, mini projector, loud speakers, microphones, radio, sound systems, television); and the training package
to be used to raise awareness about adolescent girls’ rights, needs and interests was also being finalized.20 For
the fifth intervention, AAA had finalized the Community-based Life skills training package and initiated
preparations for its delivery in all five provinces. The sixth intervention, the Unconditional Cash Grants, was to be
implemented in Ghor and Herat. For the seventh activity, Community-based Vocational Training for adolescent
girls, the training packages were under development, and the ActionAid Consortium was not only planning to
execute the training, but they IPs were investigating links with local business groups and existing civil society
organisations.21 The programme effectiveness section includes a full description of each programme component
as well as the extent to which their targets were met.
Finally, in 2019, the process of mapping and documenting the status of adolescent girls in Afghanistan (the revised
objective 3), was in its inception phase. For example, the evaluation consultants, Econometria, were already
contracted to carry out this programme component, and they had developed a protocol designed to identify and
reach the most vulnerable programme participants to receive an Unconditional Cash Grant (using a randomized
control trial (RCT) methodology).22 In support of this process, they were conducting a listing exercise, and then
the collection of baseline data would follow. Ultimately, revised objective 3 was only partially completed, and the
efficiency section elaborates on the factors linked to a less than expected programme performance. The AWLI
programme completed all implementation on 31 December 2020.

22 The unconditional cash grants were designed to support families with adolescent girls who were transitioning from Accelerated Learning Centres (ALCs) to secondary
school levels, and so the listing exercise sampled households within three kilometres of the catchment areas of all ALCs in the eight pre-selected districts in Ghor and Herat.
After this listing exercise, Econometria would “randomly select ten households to receive cash transfer in treatment ALC catchment areas (from the list of eligible households).”

Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) in 1994. However, it is acknowledged that duty-bearers may be primarily state actors, which includes all the organs of the
state such as parliaments, ministries, local authorities, judges and justice authorities, police, teachers or extension workers. All these are legal duty-bearers.

A.2.1 STAKEHOLDER MAP
As noted earlier, the key stakeholders for the Summative Evaluation are the S/GWI Office, UNICEF, the IRoA,
programme IPs, programme recipient groups and other stakeholders. The map below outlines each stakeholder’s
respective role(s), level of power, and interest in this evaluation.
The S/GWI office, focused on female rights and empowerment, has a strong interest in the lessons and
recommendations emerging from this evaluation. The evaluation findings not only contribute to accountability,
but they also illustrate how the United States Government funding promoted girl’s/women's economic
empowerment by reducing or eliminating barriers to entry (e.g., early marriage and interrupting girl’s education)
and expanding overall opportunities.
Figure 2: Stakeholder Map
The UNICEF ACO also has high interest and power in this
evaluation. These stakeholders will appreciate the independent
evaluation findings and, in turn, formulate and implement the
management response. Learning from this evaluation can be
incorporated into future adolescent programmes, particularly as
it relates to recognizing effective and impactful entry points for
adolescent programme modalities within Afghanistan. Similarly,
the UNICEF Regional Office for South Asia (ROSA) is keenly
interested in this evaluation, as it could inform similar
programmes in the region (i.e., Bangladesh and India).
The IRoA ministries at national and provincial levels are powerful
key partners, as they support the implementation and
sustainability of the programme. As mentioned above, these
partners are the Ministry of Education, MoWA, the Ministry of
Public Health, Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs, Ministry of Martyrs and Disabled, and the Ministry for Youth
Affairs. While the national level government partners have a coordination role (with focus on ensuring policy
coherence), the provincial level government entities serve a managerial role. The learning from the evaluation
may strengthen their respective roles, capacities, and duties to promote an environment that increases
girl’s/women's economic empowerment. However, their interest in implementation of the programme maybe
relatively limited, as they are under-resourced with high exposure to insecurity.
26 With the application of a Human Rights-based Programming Approach, AWLI strengthens the capacity of duty bearers, parents and caregivers, to meet their obligations
and for rights holders to claim their rights.
21
The implementing partners (IPs) have strong interest but limited power. They will share professional experiences
in executing AWLI’s programme, including their challenges, lessons, and opinions about programming gender
equality in Afghanistan. Aspects of learning from the evaluation may be transferrable to other similar initiatives
implemented by these NGOs.
Rights holder adolescent girls and boys and duty bearer parents, community leaders, and Village Maliks or
Mullahs also have very strong interest in this programme with limited power. However, they have experienced
the programme and have perceptions about the design and quality of the AWLI programme components which
ought to be voiced through this evaluation. Their suggested improvements will more broadly benefit current and
future beneficiaries involved in similar initiatives implemented in Afghanistan as well as other countries.
A.3 Description of the Context of the Intervention
A.3.1 SOCIAL ECONOMIC PROFILE
Afghanistan is one of the youngest countries in the world, and so there is currently a “youth bulge” within the
population. In 2018, about 64 per cent of the population was under 25 years of age,29 and this figure has almost
doubled since 2000.30
Afghanistan belongs to the category of Least Developed Countries in the world. Its Human Development Index
score stands at 0.498, thus positioning it as 168th in the ranking of the 189 countries for which the HDI scores are
available.31 Afghanistan’s Gross National Income (GNI) per capita in 2018 (Atlas method) was 550 USD, which is
well below the average of the group of fragile and conflict affected countries (which is 1,533 USD).32 The Gross
Domestic Product growth rate, around one per cent since 2013, is low and indicative of the slow economic
development of the country. Agriculture is the principal source of income for almost half of the population.
However, due to the protracted period of conflict, which is continuing to impact the general population in
Afghanistan,33 agricultural development is hampered, and natural disasters further deteriorate the situation.34
According to the Afghanistan Living Conditions Survey 2016-2017, 54.5 per cent of the population lives in poverty,
and “12.5 million people are identified as severely food insecure”.35 Unemployment is also high at 9.3 per cent in
2014, but this figure is likely higher due to the Pandemic.36 The share of women, aged 15 to 19 years old,
participating in the labour market in the non-agricultural sector is only 20.3 per cent, indicating that female youth
are experiencing major challenges when pursuing employment.37
A.3.2 RELEVANT POLICIES AND IROA INSTITUTIONS
According to Article 70 of Afghanistan’s civil law, the legal age for marriage is 16 for girls and 18 for boys. A girl
who is 15 years old can, however, be married with the consent of her father or a court (Article 71).38 Parents may
arrange to marry off their daughters for a myriad of reasons, including cultural (i.e., to relevant family standing),
economic (i.e., to repay debts), political (i.e., to resolve tribal conflicts39).

According to the National Action Plan (NAP) 2017–2021 to Eliminate Early and Child Marriage in Afghanistan, the
Government of the IRoA “is committed to taking firm steps to address early and child marriage” with the support
of United Nations partners. The NAP outlines actions designed to prevent and end early and child marriage, and
to improve the implementation of laws and services which aim to support for people at risk of early and child
marriage.40 Specifically, under the leadership of the Deputy Ministry for Youth Affairs (DMoYA) and MoWA, the
NAP provides the roadmap “which will play an essential part in coordinating and guiding interventions,
programmes and projects on early and child marriage in Afghanistan over the course of the next five years.”41
The 2018 Girls’ Education Policy, which also benefits from the leadership support of MoWA, outlines the
commitment to help girls to continue their education by increasing the number of girl students, providing continued
facilities for women, and decreasing the level of illiteracy. However, there is a gender gap in formal primary
education, which has grown in recent years. The 2015 Demographic Health Survey (DHS) indicates that “nine
percent of ever-married women, and 31% of ever-married men, aged 15-49, have completed at least some
secondary education. However, only five per cent of women and 17 per cent of men have completed secondary
school or beyond. Eighty-four per cent of women and half of men have never attended school. Only 15% of
women and 49% of men are literate.42
While there are many factors forcing girls to drop out of school, early marriage and the lack of support to continue
formal schooling rank as key causes.43 Indeed, “the interaction between the number of years of a girl’s schooling
and the postponement of marriage is firmly established by demographic studies.”44 Early marriage is a major
contributor to extremely low rates of school enrolment amongst girls, particularly at the secondary level, and the
table below lists some of these influencing factors.
Table 2: Positive and negative factors associated with the likelihood of early marriage.
Direction of National & Regional Evidence which Increases or
Influence Decreases The Likelihood of Child Marriage
Early marriage is more likely in regions where the practice is generally acceptable due to
existing, harmful social norms and traditions.
Secondary school dropouts who are female - are two [combined] variables that are closely
associated with child marriage, and as a result, are likely to experience limited economic
advancement. For example, 56.8 per cent girls (aged 16-8 years of age) “are less likely to
be attending school, generally, and are more likely to be neither in school nor working”.45
The lack of a sense of autonomy and agency are strong drivers. They include limited to no
access to reproductive health care, no ability to give informed consent on different practices,
and restrictions on their movements. All of these factors increase the likelihood of early
marriage and adolescent pregnancy.46, 47

41 Ibid, page 5. It should be noted that the NAP focuses on the elimination of early marriage by putting in place enabling policy instruments, and it is not certain if AWLI’s
community-based services, which had been ongoing for a few years, benefitted from or was influenced by such upstream interventions.

(Maktabeh Motevaseteh) (Grade 7–9), upper secondary school (Doreyeh Aali) (Grade 10–12) and various types of vocational schools (teachers’ schools and technical
schools) under the leadership of the Ministry of Education (MoE). Other elements of the education system include community-based education (CBE), accelerated learning
programmes to allow students delayed in their education to join their age group, and early childhood education (ECE).

Direction of National & Regional Evidence which Increases or
Influence Decreases The Likelihood of Child Marriage
Regionally, higher educational levels, greater wealth, and a larger share of working
household members are linked to a decrease in child marriage.48
Regionally, economic development (although speculative) and access to social and mass-
media are negatively correlated with child marriage.49
A.3.3 POWER RELATIONS & AFGHAN CULTURE
Within the younger population, adolescents particularly suffer from violence, abuse and an insecure environment
perpetuated by cultural and traditional practices. The Child Rights International Network (CRIN) reported
persistent violations of children’s rights, including high rates of malnutrition, forced/early marriage, violence against
children, sexual exploitation and abuse, child labour, and children affected by armed conflict.50 These violations
are especially severe for girls. Child marriage51 is particularly high, according to the State of the World’s Children
2019, where 35 per cent of 20-24-year-old women in Afghanistan were first married or in a union before 18 years
of age (versus only seven per cent for males).52 The DHS also indicates that the median age at first marriage
among ever married women, aged 25-49, is 18.5.53 These estimates also vary between those residing in urban
and rural areas and education levels. In Afghanistan, child marriage is mainly a result of harmful traditional
practices, socio-economic factors, and a lack of appreciation for the value of education.
Women are also exposed to the risk of pregnancy at an early age with 11 per cent of women aged from 25 to 49
having had their first sexual intercourse by age 15 and 42 per cent before age 18. By age 20, 62 per cent of
women have had sexual intercourse.54 As a consequence of early marriages, adolescent pregnancy (fertility rate
is 69 births per 1000 adolescent women55) fosters high rates of maternal mortality. There is limited awareness of
the considerable health risks associated with child marriage. Primarily, early pregnancy is closely linked to the
extremely high maternal mortality rate (MMR), which is 638 per 100,000 live births.56 Negative outcomes
associated with MMR also include illness and disability due to early pregnancy, including obstetric fistula from
obstructed labour, among other complications. Young mothers are subject to these negative health outcomes,
because their bodies are simply not yet sufficiently developed for childbirth.
A.3.4 THE GLOBAL AGENDA OF EARLY MARRIAGE57
Child marriage, recognized as a human rights violation under international law, is explicitly enumerated under the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), the Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, among other international legal instruments.
Further, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are the tools used to plan, monitor, and achieve a more
equitable future for all. Child marriage intersects multiple SDGs although there is one, SDG 5, which aims to

create gender equality, and this SDG is specifically dedicated to the elimination of child marriage and the
promotion of girls’ education. However, there are at least seven other goals directly linked and an additional nine
which are indirectly linked.
Specifically, child marriage is most often associated with poverty (SDG 1), hunger (SDG 2), lack of access
to/inadequate health care (SDG 3), lack of access to education (SDG 4), economic disenfranchisement and
marginalization (SDG 8), economic inequality (SDG 10), as well as sexual and conflict-related violence and lack
of access to justice (SDG 16). Generally, there is a need to use multifaceted, intersectional approaches to address
early marriage and the interruption or cessation of education for girls, and these approaches are especially
important given that Afghanistan is a conflict zone. For example, girls are even more vulnerable to child
marriage/limited education due to:
(1) increased insecurity—wherein a daughter is involuntarily entered into a marriage based on familial
perceptions that such an arrangement can protect her;
(2) the belief that marriage keeps girls from delinquency, prostitution, or debauchery – or poverty;
(3) poverty, which makes collecting a dowry, or “bride price” a form of family survival;58
(4) weak state institutions, which ought to offer education, protection, and other services to vulnerable
groups but do not; and
(5) displaced and disrupted community relationships, which tend to breakdown in humanitarian situations.
SECTION B
B. EVALUATION PURPOSE, OBJECTIVES, & SCOPE
B.1 Evaluation Purpose
This summative evaluation is a requirement of the grant obligations from the S/GWI, award number S-LMAQM-
15-GR-1304. As per the Terms of Reference (ToR), the purpose of this evaluation is to contribute to:
(i) evidence-based and risk-informed programming on increasing access of out-of-school (OoS) adolescent
girls to secondary education;
(ii) programming on changing societal perceptions about: (a) child marriage practices; and (b) girls’
empowerment in Afghanistan; and
(iii) institutional learning about the complex relationships linking financial incentives, education, and
perceptions on child marriage/girls’ empowerment. (See annex 1 for the ToR)
As further reasoning, there is limited global evidence connecting these variables (i.e., school attendance,
perceptions on child marriage, and girl’s empowerment), and so the results from this evaluation are also expected
to add value to the global movements dedicated to ending child marriage and promoting the education of
adolescent girls. Given that this evaluation is likely to generate lessons learned (and recommendations) about
programming adolescent activities, this evaluation produces instrumental and refined evidence about programme
approaches. It also elaborates what efforts in other provinces look like, where there is advocacy supporting OoS
adolescent girls in Afghanistan. Therefore, the users of this evaluation are not only the United States Government
and UNICEF in Afghanistan, but also others working for UNICEF and NGOs in the world (e.g., Bangladesh,
Ethiopia, India, etc.) who are also committed to the elimination of child marriage, girl’s empowerment and
programmes supporting adolescents.

B.2 Evaluation Objectives
This summative evaluation’s objectives are to:
 Measure the relevance, effectiveness, cohesion, efficiency, sustainability, and impact of the AWLI programme
in regard to increasing school enrolment of adolescent girls and stimulating social behaviour change related
to perceptions of child marriage and girls’ empowerment; and
 Identify [and confirm] gaps in the programme results chain/ToC, lessons learned, and provide
recommendations on how to design, implement, and scale up similar programmes in the rest of Afghanistan.
B.3 Evaluation Scope, Approach & GEEW
The evaluation’s ToR outlines the scope according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development’s-Development Assistance Committee (OECD-DAC) evaluation criteria, which is relevance,
effectiveness, efficiency, coherence, sustainability, and impact, to be used in the evaluation.59 The thematic area,
or criteria, of “impact”, although part of the ToR, is not comprehensively explored as planned. There are several
factors which have led to the partial exclusion of some impact questions, and they are: (1) the lack of time and
brevity of the evaluation exercise (three months); (2) inadequate sample size at the stage when the baseline data
was collected; (3) the limitation that the evaluation only collected data in three out of five programme provinces
(to be discussed in the methodology section); and (4) the programme participants who received an Unconditional
Cash Grant were not exposed to social mobilization activities. Given that programme participants who received
an Unconditional Cash Grant did not take part in social mobilization activities, the third evaluation purpose, which
was to contribute to institutional learning about the complex relationships linking financial incentives, education,
and perceptions on child marriage/girls’ empowerment, was also not fully addressed. In essence, this summative
evaluation reviews all the seven interventions carried out in three out of five provinces, and they are: 1) Herat; 2)
Nangahar, and 3) Samangan and also covers the key milestones of programme implementation from 2015
through 2020.
This evaluation employs a combination of a theory-driven approach and utilization-focused approach. First, a
theory-driven evaluation relies heavily on a Theory of Change (ToC) in order to understand better the degree to
which programme participants have effectively changed or have been impacted by the programme. This approach
seems fitting, as it highlights how, theoretically, the causal chains to achieve attitudinal and behavioural change
have occurred as a result of being exposed to the programme.60 Second, a utilization-focused approach is guided
by the needs of the primary intended users [UNICEF], and these stakeholders were actively engaged in making
meaning of the data throughout the entire process, from its conception (ToR), planning (securing ethical clearance
and inception report), and ensuring that findings, conclusions and recommendations were accurate, relevant,
practical, respectively.61 For example, the evaluation report underwent three thorough reviews by UNICEF
Afghanistan and ROSA colleagues. After the draft report was submitted, a stakeholder workshop/presentation
took place virtually with the stakeholders from S/GWI (donor), UNICEF Afghanistan, headquarters, and ROSA,
whereby the recommendations were not only discussed but the implications for UNICEF’s future programming
opportunities in Afghanistan were contemplated. The dissemination of the evaluation, through the UNICEF
website, will enable interested stakeholders to access this document.
Finally, it should be noted that while a Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (GEEW) perspective is
not explicitly mentioned in the ToR, it is important to understand that the programme design integrates an equity
and a gender approach to include those and girls and boys, families, communities most affected by early marriage
located in the areas where early marriage is most prevalent (e.g., remote communities and resourced-restricted
provinces in Afghanistan). Hence, while the construct of GEEW is not formally framed within the evaluation, these

concerns are inherently part of the evaluand, and therefore, the entire evaluation process.62 Annex 2, the
Integration of Gender, Equity, and Human Rights in the Evaluation, includes a checklist of the evaluation’s
adherence to these key principles.
B.3.1.1 Theory of Change (ToC)
It is recognized that the AWLI Baseline Report presents a conceptual framework that outlines the key
drivers/enablers of early marriage as well as the corresponding programme components, which are designed “to
change attitudes, behaviours, and perceptions on the acceptability of child marriage.”63 This ToC had gaps,
however, as it did not include strategies linked to expected intermediate outcomes which delineated how key
programme components would lead to desired impact. After a thorough review of existing documentation, it
appears that there are multiple ToCs and frameworks available for the same thematic areas (e.g., ending child
marriage and the promotion of girl’s education).64 During the evaluation inception phase, the Team Leader
consulted with all of these relevant resources and reformulated the ToC to include programme activities and
corresponding components, strategies, and intermediate outcomes. This ToC, with elaborated intermediate
outcomes coupled with corresponding strategies, was intended to better inform the three levels (individual,
family/community, and institutional levels) through which to measure AWLI’s effects on programme participants.
The figure 3, reflecting the reformulated ToC, presents the basic premise that IF adolescent rights holders and
their families (or/and communities) use the opportunities from AWLI’s three key interventions, namely (1) capacity
development, (2) Social Behaviour Change and other awareness raising activities, (3) Unconditional Cash Grants
in Herat, and/or (4) Community -based Livelihood Training (in the case of Samangan), THEN:
1. The adolescent rights holders at risk of child marriage may express themselves and exercise choices
regarding marriage and sexual and reproductive health (individual level);
2. The households and communities with adolescents at risk of child marriage may demonstrate positive
attitudes regarding gender equality (family and community levels); and
3. The adolescent rights holders at risk of child marriage may express themselves and exercise choices in:
a. the continuation of their education; or
b. their livelihood with entrepreneurial activities (institutional levels).

Figure 3: Reformulated Theory of Change
Source: ToR reformulated by the evaluator.
The process which should take place for a rights holder to believe that he or she could take action when
responding to the messages about delaying marriage and extending education is critical to understanding
the adolescent model. The logic is that interpersonal communications and interpersonal relations are expected to
happen at all levels (individual, family/community, and institutional), and AWLI’s contributions will, in turn, lead to
or influence attitudes, traditional beliefs, and, ultimately behaviour change. 65 More specifically, IF rights holders
discuss and reflect on messages (delivered through trusted channels), THEN they will be encouraged or and
motivated to adopt the new attitudes and practices and change their behaviour (see table below for more specific
If-Then statements for the three levels). The results from operationalizing the intermediate outcomes through key
informant interviews-KIIs will provide an opportunity for rights holders and duty bearers to share their views about
whether broader change has emerged in their constructed reality.

As noted in the table, the above processes through which attitudinal and behaviour change are expected to take
place cannot occur without meeting the underlying assumptions. At the individual rights holder level, it is
assumed that not only are the messages from AWLI sufficiently persuasive and effective (including the
consequences of early marriage and limiting education), but that the person experiencing the programme also
can use that information by expressing his/her viewpoints/opinions with others (through interpersonal
communication). Similarly, at the community level, duty bearer stakeholders and Community and Religious
Leaders will demonstrate positive attitudes/behaviour after engaging in interpersonal communication. Finally, it is
assumed that the rights holder, and her family (with an Unconditional Cash Grant) has an experience, and
therefore a greater likelihood, of making her own decisions (with her family) regarding health care, education,
or/and lifestyle. It is also assumed that the rights holder has a market and support to sustain the entrepreneurial
activity.

Evaluation Questions
Overall Q6. The extent to which the project has increased secondary school enrolment of out of school adolescent girls and changed
social behaviours and attitudes towards child marriage.
Q 6.1 What difference has the project made in changing perceptions of the target groups on child marriage? Have they delayed
marriage by raising awareness on the rights of adolescent girls to education, or for other reasons?
Q 6.2 Has the project made a difference in adolescent girls’ lives by increasing their ability to make life choices?
Q 6.3 How successful has the combination of social mobilization activities and cash transfers been on increasing secondary enrolment
rates of adolescent girls and changing social behaviour towards child marriage vis-à-vis social mobilization interventions alone?69
Q 6.4 How has raising awareness on the harmful effects of child marriage contributed to adolescent girls being able to attend school
and subsequently enhanced their chances of delaying marriage?70
Q 6.5 What were the effects, intended or unintended, that the programme had on sources of tension and sources of cohesion in the 20
districts where it worked, and how were these monitored over time?
N.B. While the evaluation may not be able to comprehensively answer this overarching Q6, due to limited data, nuanced self-
reported insights about perceived changes (in the family and the community) will be gathered through the use of qualitative
methods. Specifically, the KIIs will generate specific examples of how the programme has changed perceptions about early
marriage and the importance of continuing girl’s education.71

69 As noted under B3, this question could not be addressed comprehensively, as the programme participants who received an unconditional cash grant were not exposed to social mobilization activities. Given that programme participants
who received an unconditional cash grant did not take part in social mobilization activities, this evaluation cannot contribute to institutional learning about the complex relationships linking financial incentives, education, and perceptions on
child marriage/girls’ empowerment.
70 There is also a lack of evidence that can prove that a number of marriages have been delayed or reduced and that there have been relative increases in the number of adolescent girls attending secondary school.
71 These examples will not be representative of the entire programme. Also note that adolescents are not as articulate compared to adults, and so their “stories” may not be very detailed. Finally, given the sensitivity of the topic, some
interviewees may not be willing to discuss private matters; Many do not even discuss such issues with their parents or guardians much less with a researcher who is not known to them. As noted in the limitations section, given the need for
informed consent, some interviewee responses may not be very explicit or elaborate.

SECTION C
C. METHODOLOGY
A mixed methods design was adopted, leveraging both qualitative and quantitative evidence to answer the KEQs
(a noted above in the evaluation matrix). Essentially, the main types of information sources collected were:
1. Documents which included pre-existing qualitative and quantitative information based on the existing
logframe activity, outputs, and baseline data;
2. Existing M&E data, Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) and Results Assessment Module (RAM); and
3. Primary data from key informant interviews (KIIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) at community
levels.
C.1 Secondary Data Collection: Documents Review & Use of Monitoring Data
The main reference documents and other evidence are listed below.
1. Theoretical documents regarding perceptions about early marriage and the promotion of education,
and ;
2. Relevant national policies and legislation;
3. Secondary data from DHS and populations estimates;
4. Monitoring data from Implementing Partners (IPs) regarding programme outreach;
5. UNICEF internal documents (i.e., Strategic Plans, donor reports, budgets, IP reports);
6. Information about the Global agenda to End Child Marriage;
7. Data from PDM and RAM; and
8. United Nations standards guiding this practice to the United Nations Evaluation Group’s (UNEG)

The drivers of early marriage and the discontinuation of education among adolescent females were derived from
research conducted in Afghanistan, and to some extent, Southeast Asia (i.e., Bangladesh and India). This
research was purposefully selected to better understand the profile of the target population, adolescent females
aged 12 to 18. The Team Leader also reviewed policy documents and past UNICEF internal reports and budgets
to clarify the policy and operational context in which AWLI was implemented from 2015 to 2020. This substantive
information contributed greatly to the relevance and efficiency sections of this report. To assess coherence, the
Team Leader identified any relevant documents discussing the design, implementation, and evaluation of any
programme which was part of the global movement to end child marriage as part of female empowerment (e.g.,
Global Programme to End Child Marriage). Given the dearth of such information, the Team Leader asked key
informants for any references that they may have known about. In addition to documents, the Team Leader
searched for any relevant data from the internet (i.e., websites, social media, etc.) to add to the overall data set.
Finally, it should be known that the existing M&E data, PDM72 and RAM73, was an additional information source
used to triangulate other internal UNICEF resources and substantiate evaluation findings. Annex 3 includes
resources consulted.
72 This database included responses from 230 persons who could comment on their experiences while receiving the unconditional cash grant.
73 This results management system includes several indicators for assessing AWLI’s progress. While the information was not perfect, it provided an overview of changes in
the operating context.

C.2 Primary Data Collection
C.2.1 COMMUNITY SAMPLING & SELECTION
The programme covered five provinces with high rates of child marriage practices, namely: (1) Nangarhar; (2)
Samangan; (3) Ghor; (4) Herat; and (5) Farah (see figure 1). Only three, out of the five, provinces were
selected for data collection, and the justification for this decision was that there was pressure to complete this
evaluation from the donor. Despite the need to expedite the evaluation, however, the logic guiding province
selection was to have a balanced regional representation. Therefore, one province in all three regions was
selected.74 Given that there were three provinces located in the Western Region (i.e., Herat, Farah, Ghor), Herat
was prioritized, as it was the only province with the Unconditional Cash Grant component. Herat also had the
highest population density, compared to the other two provinces in the Western Region (Farah and Ghor). All
provinces had to be safe for the data collection teams, and Ghor and Farah, at the time were very hard to reach.
The selected three provinces and corresponding districts are outlined in table 5.
Table 5: Selected provinces and districts for data collection.
Province Districts
Nangarhar (1) Jalalabad; (2) Surkh rud; and (3) Kama. Jalalabad is mainly peri-urban, and Surkh rud
lacks an industry and is isolated; Kama has a notable Internally Displaced Populations
(IDPs).
Samangan (1) Roi-do-ab75, (2) Dara-i-soof-i-payan76, and (3) Dara-i-soof-i-bala. Roi-do-ab is mainly
peri-urban and has an industry, and Dara-i-soof-i-bala is isolated. Although the three
districts were sampled, the national research team (QARA) worked primarily in Feroz
Nakhcher district, where it was safe. More information about this issue is discussed in the
limitations section.
Herat (1) Herat, (2) Enjil77, and (3) Karrukh. Herat is mainly peri-urban, and Enjil has a number of
IDPs, and it experienced floods in 2019. Karrukh is noteworthy for its agricultural
production.
At the sub-district level, the sampling strategy was purposive, as QARA, the national research firm, worked with
the IPs to determine the sub-district communities which were most likely to have had a high exposure to
programme activities. See annex 4 for more details regarding the selection criteria used for provinces, sub-
districts, and individuals.
C.2.2 STAKEHOLDER SAMPLE
The following stakeholders were consulted to gain a better understanding about the progress toward objectives,
programme relevance, effectiveness of services delivered, lessons learned, recommendations for improvements,
and other information required to respond to the KEQs (i.e., End Child Marriage interventions ongoing in nationally,
etc.).78 A total of five different stakeholder groups were consulted, and each had their own unique qualitative
interview guide or focus guide.
1. UNICEF: UNICEF staff (Girls Education, Health, Nutrition, Protection, and Procurement/Supply);
2. UN & NGO Family working on End Child Marriage: UNFPA and Aga Khan Foundation;
74 For example, there was one province located in the North (i.e., Samangan) and one province in the East (i.e., Nangahar) selected. Given that there were three provinces
located in the Western Region (i.e., Herat, Farah, Ghor), Herat was prioritized, as it was the only province with the Unconditional Cash Grant component.
75 Coalmines are the source of income.
76 Dara-i-soof-i-payan does not have a safe space.
77 Includes Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and experienced floods in 2019.
78 Prior to data collection, the Team Leader engaged in a field trip to Kabul and Herat, for which the selection criterion was: (1) free of security concerns; (2) unconditional
grant distribution; and (3) the availability of programme participants, since the closure in 2020. She engaged with stakeholders during this field trip, namely UNICEF, WASSA-
IP, and community members who have been exposed to the programme (a. female adolescent programme participants-aged 14-18).
39
3. IRoA: at Central and Provincial levels (Education, Public Health, and MoWA79);
4. IPs: Action Aid and three consortium members; and
5. The community level: There are four different groups:
a. Female adolescent programme participants;
b. Male adolescents;
c. Mothers and fathers; and
d. Community and Religious Leaders (Imams and Mullahs), especially those who received training through
AWLI.
It should be noted that during the Inception Phase (from 27 February to 6 March 2021), the Team Leader traveled
to Kabul (which included a field trip to Herat). The selection criterion for visiting this particular province was that
it: (1) was free of security concerns; (2) had the Unconditional Cash Grant component; and (3) the programme
participants were accessible since the programme’s closure in December 2020. The Team Leader engaged with
many stakeholders during this field trip, namely: (1) UNICEF, (2) WASSA-IP programme management, (4) IP
service providers (i.e., community facilitators, Safe Space Counsellor, Mini Media Club Facilitator); (4) and female
adolescent programme participants (aged 14-18), among others. The KIIs conducted by the Team Leader are
presented in the table below. Roughly a little over one-half of the sample was female. Annex 5, List of
Stakeholders Interviewed in Kabul, Herat, & Remotely, includes the data collection method (interview-in person
or remote or FGD), the organization, and gender disaggregated information.

C.2.2.1 Community-based Qualitative Interviews
The table below presents the number of persons who participated in qualitative data collection by information
source (by province and district). All sampled participants had been exposed to or taken part in at least one activity,
namely: (1) Community Dialogues; (2) Reflection Circles; (3) Mini-Media Clubs; (4) Community-based Life Skills
sessions; and (5) Unconditional Cash Grant [only for Herat]; (6) Community-based Livelihood Training [only for
Samangan]. Again, annex 4, Communities & Individuals Selection Criteria, presents 3 more details regarding the
selection of individuals. In addition, due to the security situation in Samangan, two districts were not accessible.
QARA conducted interviews for one district by telephone, and the district of Feroz Nakhcher replaced Dara-i-
soof-i-payan. While the sample sizes for each data collection method and are shown in the table below, annex
6, Qualitative Sample At a Glance, includes the overall sample sizes for each province, by stakeholder group (i.e.,
adolescent girl, boy, community leader, religious leader, gender disaggregated data, and the sample size of
respondents for each programme component.

While the question of sampling (separately) persons with disabilities (PWDs) has been raised, it is important to
understand that in addition to sampling community residents and families, this evaluation took deliberate steps to
gather views from adolescents under age 18. The individuals in this age group, which is comprised of 22% (n=36)
of the entire sample (n=162), may be categorized as “vulnerable”, as all those interviewed (male and female) were
at risk of violence, abuse, sexual exploitation, early and forced marriage.
80 All subjects were coded as “young”, and they had ages which ranged from 11 to 33 (females) and 17 to 40 (males).
41
C.2.3 METHODS USED
C.2.3.1 Focus Group Discussions with IPs
QARA conducted all focus group discussions with three IPs (ECW, OHW, and WASSA). These discussions
included three to six persons, including (i) the Programme Manager, (ii) Programme Monitor, and (iii) a Facilitator
who had direct contact with communities. The FGDs generated strong, in-depth, and detailed information about:
(i) targeting of programme communities/participants, (ii) strategies used to engage the community residents
(Community Leaders and Religious Leaders, families, and residents); (iii) the level of frequency of these
engagements; (iv) how they persuaded residents to change their attitudes and practices regarding early marriage
and promoting girl’s education (including what was done right/not right in implementation); (v) challenges
experienced; and (vi) their suggestions for future programmes. A total of 11 males and 3 females took part in
FGDs. The FDGs were lengthy, taking up to two hours.
C.2.3.2 KIIs
QARA also conducted qualitative interviews with Community/Religious Leaders, parents, and adolescents. The
scope of these interviews was to understand the perspectives about programme, namely its design, satisfaction
with its activities, what messages were understood and used (with other family members and or community
residents), how this programme could be improved in the future. Annex 7 includes the Data Collection Instruments
for each stakeholder group interviewed. This includes:
(1) adolescent girls; (2) adolescent girls & parents who were recipients of Unconditional Cash Grants; (3)
adolescent boys; (4) parents; (5) UNICEF-Management; (6) UNICEF Sector Offices; (7) IRoA-Central and
Provincial; (8) IPs; and (9) community & religious leaders. The qualitative interview guides for all stakeholder
groups were drafted in English, provided to QARA for translation into Dari and Pashto languages, and then
pretested.
Mothers and fathers were interviewed separately to understand the differences in attitudes, perceptions, needs,
and experiences by sex, thereby creating a more comfortable situation for sharing ideas and opinions. The key
element was to ensure that the data was accurate, thereby reflecting what the current thinking about child marriage
and the promotion of education for that province or district. These KIIs also covered satisfaction with the
programme activities, perceptions about the appropriateness of the programme’s design, its effectiveness,
challenges, and perceived impact. The Team Leader had also pretested four statements measuring sentiments
about early marriage and promoting education among girls. Females represented 66% of the overall sample
(n=162). The KIIs did not take more than 45 minutes.
C.3 Analysis
The Team Leader conducted an iterative, inductive approach to the data analysis. First, the document review
relied on thematic narrative analysis for highlighting key themes identified (programme evolution over time,
triangulation of programme outputs) and connect these elements to the relevant issues and key evaluation
questions. Second, the reformulated ToC was validated, examining whether attitudes and behaviour about
delaying or ending child marriage and extending education occurred. In the event that the data indicated positive
attitudes and practices regarding these key areas, the Team Leader noted if overall assumptions about the context
were also met to generate a plausible argument for programme contribution to desired results. This guiding
reasoning, or a contribution analysis, confirmed that the programme had, indeed, contributed to desired
results.81 Third, descriptive statistics for (i) geographic location; (ii) age of programme participants; and (iii) gender
were drawn from several sources of quantitative data, namely the donor reports, the IP’s database, and UNICEF
M&E data. The qualitative dataset was also sufficiently large to produce its own descriptive statistics. See annex
8 for the List of Qualitative Interviews undertaken in Nangahar, Samangan, and Herat provinces.
81 The analysis is specifically, a Contribution Analysis of Direct Influence, which includes reviewing and reformulating a ToC’s expected outputs and intermediate outcomes,
and then observing whether the immediate results resulting from the programme were consistent with the ToC in light of other influencing factors. Mayne, J. (2008).
Contribution analysis: An approach to exploring cause and effect. Institutional Learning and Change Brief No. 7.
42
The qualitative analysis process used three steps to the thematic analysis to emerge, including: (i) creating a
codebook which linked codes directly to the KEQs and the assumptions of the ToC; and (ii) reviewing elements
or factors influencing programme effectiveness; (iii) collecting examples where impact took place (using emotion,
value, and action child codes); and (iv) noting where suggested improvements could occur for future programme
implementation. The List of Codes Under Each Evaluation Criteria is available in annex 9. Finally, the results
from the statements collected at the end of all qualitative interviews were mostly positive, which may be
encouraging. However, these results did not meet the condition of linearity (for quantitative data), and so the
information was not used in this report.
C.4 Ethical Considerations
C.4.1 UNEG ETHICAL STANDARDS & OFFICIAL APPROVAL
The evaluation was undertaken in accordance with UNEG Norms and Standards for Evaluation82, and UNICEF
Procedure for Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation, Data Collection and Analysis.83 All engagement with
participants younger than 18 years of age was based on the principles outlined in the International Charter for
Ethical Research Involving Children.84 Before any data collection began, the evaluation protocols, instruments,
and tools underwent an ethical review with HML Institutional Review Board (IRB), which is an autonomous
committee, authorized by the United States Office for Human Research Protections within the United States
Department of Health and Human Services (IRB 00001211). This entity issued ethics approval (HML IRB Review
#366AFGH21) to collect data from children under age 18 who were expected to contribute to the evaluation. See
annex 10 for a copy of the Letter for Ethical Approval from HML IRB.
C.4.2 ETHICAL SAFEGUARDS USED
Briefly, informed consent was collected before initiating any data collection. The stakeholders were shown respect
in the following manner:
1. The purpose of the evaluation was clearly explained, and it was made clear that here is no “right” or “wrong”
answer;
2. All participants could verbally agree to take part in an interview and could stop the interview at any time;
3. Those who were younger than 18 years of age were required to sign a “child assent form”, and their parents
had to sign a “parental consent form”. See annex 11 for the Parental Permission Form and Child Assent
Form, used to interview adolescents under the age of 18;
4. The respondent was also informed that all information provided would be kept confidential and would not be
shared with anyone outside of the evaluation team (from enumerators up through the evaluation team leader);
5. The data was combined with other data and then used to draw conclusions and recommendations; and
6. All documentation was stored and transferred in password-protected files.
The annex 12, Description of Ethical Safeguards, delineates the team’s adherence to UNEG Norms and
Standards, including (1) Preparing for data collection; (2) Data Collection; and (3) Quality Assurance Mechanisms
to Enhance Data Credibility.
C.4.3 EVALUATOR OBLIGATIONS
The Team Leader and researchers from QARA also fulfilled their ethical obligations, in that they were independent
with no conflict of interest, as they were not involved in AWLI’s design or implementation. The team was also
impartial or had no vested interest in generating positive or negative evaluation findings. Finally, when there was
a notable, emergent theme of adolescent females engaging in self-harm in the past (reported through KIIs), the
Team Leader showed accountability and transparency by drawing attention to this occurrence to UNICEF staff.

C.5 Limitations
This evaluation had numerous limitations which are explained in this section.
C.5.1 SECURITY
The security situation in Afghanistan is dynamic and constantly evolving in many provinces. The use of different
levels of evaluation team members to access different regions and stakeholder levels partially mitigates these
security risks. For example, the Team Leader conducted interviews in Kabul and Herat, while QARA carried out
the interviews in the provincial capitals, districts, villages. In spite of careful planning to visit certain places,
however, QARA faced a major challenge in the Samangan Province, where there was insecurity in all three
sampled districts. To mitigate the effects of this challenge, QARA conducted face-to-face interviews in the Feroz
Nakhcher district, which was a district that was not sampled but was safe. Over 35 villages in Feruz Nakhcher
district were reviewed. Another mitigation strategy carried out by QARA was to conduct telephone interviews (in
place of face-to-face interviews) with at least five to six participants in the two districts which were inaccessible
(e.g., Roi-do-ab and Dara-i-soof-i-bala). Even with these efforts, however, the data was not sufficient to test
the ToC and link programme results between: (1) Community-based Livelihood Training (and the ensuing
entrepreneurial activity) and (2) a rights holder’s ability to make lifestyle choices.
C.5.2 TIME CONSTRAINTS
Due to pressing requirements from the donor, the evaluation process had limited time, and so only three provinces
were visited. There is a risk in that the data collected does not represent the entire programme reality. However,
consultations with UNICEF stakeholders virtually ensured that a balanced view is reflected in the final evaluation
report.
C.5.3 PROGRAMME CLOSURE
While the programme ended roughly three months before the data collection for the Summative Evaluation was
initiated, there were a handful of programme participants who experienced some difficulties remembering the
frequency of Community Dialogue and Reflection Group activities. QARA reconfirmed this data with the IP to
reconcile the difference when this limitation was noted.
C.5.4 STAFF TURNOVER
The ACO is categorized as a Non-Family Duty Station, which means that due to security reasons, family members
are not authorized to travel the office. While staff are allowed Rest and Recuperation (R&R) travel to ameliorate
work-life balance and limit the stress derived from working for extended periods, many staff do not wish to work
in Afghanistan for long periods of time (more than three years).85 To partially mitigate this limitation, the Team
Leader: (1) interviewed four different managers responsible for programmatic decisions; (2) interviewed national
staff working in multiple sectors (Adolescent Health, Education, C4D, Child Protection, and Nutrition); and (3)
sought different information sources, including Donor Reports and Annual Reports to develop an understanding
about how expected outputs occurred. In spite of these efforts, however, process details about implementation
during AWLI’s early phase (before and during 2018) were insufficient for reporting.
C.5.5 SELECTION BIAS
Since the IPs helped QARA to identify programme participants, it is possible that the qualitative sample may have
included individuals who had mostly positive attitudes and reflections about the programme’s activities. To mitigate
85 CF/EXD/2011-001 (2011). UNICEF’s Corporate Emergency Activation Procedure, UNICEF’s Corporate Emergency Activation Procedure.
44
this limitation, the Team Leader provided QARA with the sampling framework that outlined a specific number of
KIIs with individuals who had to fulfill specific criteria (age, gender, and programme participation in at least two
different activities).
When QARA arrived in Herat to interview families who received the Unconditional Cash Grant, it was discovered
that these families had not been exposed to any SBC activities. This limitation therefore did not permit a two-
group comparison of (i) those who had only participated in SBC; (ii) with those who had received a grant and
participated in SBC activities. Hence, one of the impact related KEQs could not be addressed as planned.
C.5.6 LIMITATIONS IN DATA ELABORATION
Adolescents typically are not as articulate compared to adults, and so their “stories” may not be very detailed.
This, combined with the fact that the topics of early marriage and continuing education are perceived as very
private and sensitive topics, resulted in a small proportion of interviewees who were not willing to engage at length
with QARA researchers. To mitigate this concern, the extended protocol used made interviewees comfortable,
ensuring that their voices were being heard and their values respected. Indeed, in some of the transcripts,
adolescent and young females disclosed that they had never discussed issues related to early marriage with
anyone (including their parents, caretakers, and siblings), yet they were comfortable enough to share their
experiences and perceptions with QARA researchers.
C.5.7 DATA REPRESENTATIVENESS
Examples garnered through qualitative methods are not to be considered representative of the entire programme.
Rather, data analysis was completed after substantive saturation had been achieved.86
C.5.8 TRANSLATIONS
This included a two-step process. First, data was collected in Dari and Pashto and then transcribed. From the
transcription, the text was translated into English. This data then underwent a lengthy quality assurance process.
86 Saturation is used in qualitative research as a criterion before discontinuing data collection and/or analysis. Its origins lie in grounded theory (Glaser, B.G., & Strauss,
A.L., (1967). The Discovery of Grounded Theory: Strategies for Qualitative Research. Chicago: Aldine.

SECTION D
D. KEY FINDINGS
D.1 RELEVANCE87
OVERARCHING QUESTION: Assessment of alignment of the AWLI interventions to the local context as well
as national strategies and policies of Afghanistan and UNICEF, especially among the most deprived sections
of the population, including validating existing adolescent programming ToC.
Sub Question
Is the programme aligned with the national strategies and policies of Afghanistan and the UNICEF Global
Strategic Plan 2018-2021?
D.1.1 ALIGNMENT WITH THE NATIONAL STRATEGIES AND POLICIES OF AFGHANISTAN AND UNICEF
STRATEGIES
The programme aligns with key national strategies, and AWLI’s design emanates from a
comprehensive analysis of national priorities at the provincial levels and regional research
FINDING 1
trends in early marriages. The programme is also consistent with UNICEF’s 2014-2017
Strategic Plan and 2014-2017 Gender Action Plan.
AWLI’s objectives, ending child marriage and continuing girl’s education, were (and continue to be), aligned with
the national strategies and ratified policy instruments (See text box 1), including the Convention on the Rights of
the Child. The programme is also consistent with the National Action Plan to Eliminate Early and Child Marriage
in Afghanistan.88 For example, at the Consensus Conference, it was noted that early marriage was a harmful
practice that needed to be reversed, “An assemblage of different harmful practices and family structure, cultural
and economic factors influence the decision of parents in a family to determine whether or not a girl marries at a
young age, without the girl being part of the very decision that will change her life.” 89
The selection of AWLI’s outreach to the five specific provinces was deliberate, based on the data secured from
the 2007–2008 and 2011–2012 National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment, which demonstrated where the
prevalence of child marriage was the highest.90 Additionally, research in the Asian region showed that
“Afghanistan has seen insufficient improvements in important gender-equity issues such as female child marriage,
despite substantial and growing governmental efforts to improve the status of women in the country.” 91 This
research prompted a multi-country project to reduce vulnerability of adolescents and increase their autonomy over
decisions impacting their lives with support with funding from the IKEA foundation in 13 districts of four provinces.92

Textbox 1: Alignment with IRoA Policies.
AWLI’s ALIGNMENT WITH SEVERAL RATIFIED INSTRUMENTS
United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).
The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.
Elimination of Violence Against Women (EVAW) law – which remains the main legislative tool for protecting women from violence
and criminalizes 22 acts of violence and harmful traditional practices against women and girls. This law is enacted and enforced
by a presidential decree.
The Penal Code includes provisions to punish acts of rape including those that result in injury and disability. Other sections of
the Criminal Code criminalize additional acts of violence perpetrated against women that are not codified in the EVAW law, such
as murder and kidnapping.
National Action Plan (2015-2018) on the implementation of UN Security Council resolution 1325 and a National Action Plan for
the Women of Afghanistan (2007-2017).
The MoPH has a Health and Human Rights Strategy (2014-2017).
National Gender Strategy (2012-2016).
Child Protection Law by presidential decree, which was fully aligned with the global Convention on the Rights of the Child.
UNICEF was well-suited to administer AWLI, as its aim was consistent with UNICEF’s 2014-2017 Strategic Plan,
which was that “UNICEF will identify and leverage positive synergies among related results, such as those among
improving girls’ education, ending child marriage and reducing maternal mortality.” UNICEF’s 2018-2021
Strategic Plan also continues with this priority, with Goal Area 3 (reducing child marriage) and Goal Area 5 (support
of adolescent empowerment). The designers of AWLI, also ensured that the programme was aligned with the
priorities noted in the Gender Action Plan 2014-2017, given that “girls [have] unequal access to basic health and
education services; social norms and practices such as son preference and child marriage limit and devalue girls
and their contributions and set them on a path of a lifetime of deprivations.”
OVERARCHING QUESTION: Assessment of alignment of the AWLI interventions to the local context as well
as national strategies and policies of Afghanistan and UNICEF, especially among the most deprived sections
of the population, including validating existing adolescent programming ToC.
Sub Questions
To what extent does the programme design and implementation fit the local context, including the conflict
context, and what measures were taken to adapt to changes in the context?
To what extent does the programme address and meet the needs of adolescent girls and their families,
especially those that are OoS?
D.1.2 AWLI’S DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION FIT TO THE LOCAL CONTEXT
UNICEF stakeholders noted that AWLI’s design complemented other sectors, but AWLI was
perceived as unique in that it focused on reducing early marriage, using a multi-sectoral
FINDING 2
approach. However, the focus was explicitly on girls, rather than girls and boys, which would
have been more effective at promoting girl’s education and reducing early marriage.
Data from stakeholder interviews indicates that AWLI’s program components designed to promote girl’s education
and end child marriage are very relevant. For example, it was noted that AWLI complemented the other sectors
47
in which UNICEF works, and especially education, as “early marriage is an impediment to education.”93 Another
important feature mentioned by UNICEF and IPs was that AWLI’s modality included working at the community
level in an integrated manner.94 For example, one stakeholder noted that “This programme worked with the
community, and it had an integrated approach with the community, family, and the girls.”95 Frequently, prevention
programmes which seek to fulfill a gender inequality goal are implemented in isolation and fail to recognize the
interconnected nature of the linkages among gender inequality and education, continued access to education,
small enterprise, and climate change. Indeed, AWLI’s programme components recognize the social, economic,
political, cultural, and religious drivers of child marriage and the promotion of education.
Even with this multi-sectoral approach, however, it was interpreted that the programme focused on girls, when it
ought to have focused on girls and boys, as the inclusion of men and boys tends to result in greater
sustainability with longer lasting behavior change.96 It was noted in Samangan and Nangahar, for example,
the IPs made efforts to communicate messages to rights holder girls and boys, but the data indicates less
emphasis for the IP in Herat.97 In addition to this gap, the notion of whether a holistic and multisectoral approach
is even a relevant one will be further discussed in the impact section.
D.1.3 AWLI’S RESPONSIVENESS TO THE CONFLICT CONTEXT
AWLI was well-designed to address the needs of vulnerable (OoS) girls in conflict contexts,
FINDING 3 and there appears to be no other national programme that met the specific need to reduce
early marriage.
As noted earlier, adolescents suffer from violence and abuse, and the insecure environment perpetuates these
harmful cultural and traditional practices. Girls, and especially those who are OoS and whose livelihoods are not
prioritized, are even more vulnerable in a conflict context, as there is a belief that an early marriage can protect
girls and keep them from delinquency (prostitution), and out of poverty. The rural and hard to reach
communities where AWLI was implemented also have the custom of collecting a dowry, or “bride price”, which
is a form of family financial survival. Therefore, AWLI was well-designed address early marriage in these
provinces, and it appears that a programme like AWLI is extraordinary. Interview data from IRoA stakeholders
pointed out that “there are few other relevant programmes ongoing and none at the national level.”98 This draws
attention to the fact that a programme like AWLI was unique in Afghanistan.
The steps undertaken during programme implementation, including the measures undertaken to adapt to changes
in the context, is further discussed in the effectiveness section. In particular, the tactics that the IPs used to adapt
the idea of discussing sensitive topics (i.e., the continuation of girl’s education and earlier marriage) is thoroughly
described in the next section.

OVERARCHING QUESTION: The extent to which the programme’s intended results were achieved at output
level.
Sub Question
To what extent did UNICEF deliver on its intended outputs?
This section presents a brief description of programme outputs, planned targets, and acheivement.
D.2.1 PLANNED ACTIVITIES VERSUS ACHEIVEMENTS
The AWLI programme delivered an ambitious range of seven interventions, and almost
reached all of its planned outputs. While the number of adolescents that the programme
FINDING 4
reached exceeded its target, the number of girls directly experiencing the programme was
only 82 percent (or 164,207 out of 200,000) of its target.
According to the final donor report, submitted March 2021, the number of girls, aged from 12 to 18 who directly
experienced the programme compared to the planned number, was almost met. The target was 200,000
adolescent girls, and there were only 164,207 (as of December 2020) reached. (See table below) However, the
total of adolescents reached aged 12-18, which also includes boys (or 91,347), was 255,554, and this far exceeds
the target of 200,000. Moreover, the target for the number of community members who directly experienced the
programme was 359,849, which also exceeds the target of 80,000 to 100,000.

The above figures also take into account the procurement of hygiene and recreational kits distributed to a select
number of community- based education centers in all provinces which was instituted during the reprogramming
phase in July 2020. The Summary of Planned Targets In Contrast With Achievements are in annex 13. Briefly,
for each programme component, almost all have met their planned achievements. For a fuller Description of
Programme Processes and the contents of hygiene and recreational kits, please see annex 14.
D.2.1.1 Community Dialogues
The Community Dialogue activities took place every three months, and the messages focused on the importance
of education, literacy, child marriage, and early marriage. Reports indicate that the messages were developed
99 The extent to which the programmes intended results were achieved at the output level. The information from this section drew from several sources, including the M&E
database from the IPs and UNICEF (as it relates recipients of the unconditional cash grant), donor reports, procurement and budget reports, and other project management-
related resources.
100 Due to a cumulation error identified in the 2018 and 2019 reports, a variance is reported in the cumulative numbers against what had been reported in earlier submissions.
101 A significant increase in the reach of direct beneficiaries is reported at project-end (31 December 2020) compared to figures shared as of 30 November 2020. This is due
to two main factors: first, activities under Objective 4 (distribution of hygiene and recreation kits, and installation of handwashing station) were completed in the last month of
the project; second, reach data for Mini Media Clubs and safe spaces was accounted for fully and updated after project completion.
49
based on guidelines developed from the onset of the programme. In addition to community dialogues, the IPs
facilitated advocacy activities, which forms part of a more holistic effort to not only address early marriage but also
other community priorities. For example, through advocacy, community residents discussed other needs, such
as bridges and other infrastructural issues, which were later brought to the attention of government sub-district
and district leadership levels. There was a total of 4,463 Community Dialogues sessions conducted with 76,037
participants (38,024 F/ 38,013 M) which was partially achieved, as the planned target of 5,000 with 100,000
participants.
D.2.1.2 Reflect Circles
This intervention enabled communities to discuss their own specific priorities and problems. The topics covered
were early marriage and promoting girls’ education, although it was noted that often times, the issues were not
necessarily focused on early marriage or delaying marriages (to be discussed later). Unlike Community
Dialogues, Reflect Circles were much smaller. There were ten males and ten females recruited to take part in
this activity.102 In order to participate in this activity, each community resident had to fulfill a specific selection
criteria which included, but was not limited to, (i) being able to influence others in the village; (ii) being literate;
(iii) connecting easily with others, through interpersonal communication; and (iv) sharing views without hesitation
(or being outspoken).103 One of the IPs, WASSA, reported that they even developed an “entry exam” to confirm
whether the person selected for this role had the basic level of literacy. Having a basic level of literacy was
important for this role, because Reflect Circle participants had to help develop Problem Trees and Solutions Trees.
The Reflect Circle was facilitated by two persons, and the exercise focused on discussing problems of that village.
Identified issues could then carried forward to the sub-district and even to the provincial level (if pursued). There
was a female and male Shurah (council), an informal network, which could carry these issues forward. The
longevity of the Reflect Circles is discussed in the sustainability section. The IP staff also used religious references
from Holy Quran and flip charts. There were 200 Reflect Circles established which was as planned with
42,553 participants (20,956 males and 21,597 females or 51%).
D.2.1.3 Mini Media Clubs
Mini Media Clubs were open to all the students attending school. In this space, students had the opportunity to
exchange their views, test their voices with the microphones, and develop confidence to speak in public.104 The
facilitator discussed: (i) How to manage conflicts in the home; and (ii) How to seek help from the facilitator when
there are family problems and the child experiences difficulties concentrating in school. Mini Media Clubs were
embedded within the government schools, and so they were and continue to be managed by the Provincial
Education Directorates. Fifty Mini Media Clubs were established which surpasses the planned number of
40, and these are equally distributed in boys’ and girls’ schools. Initially, it was reported that there was
no access to a projector (screens), laptop, or internet. However, currently, these services are available.
D.2.1.4 Safe Spaces
Interviews with IPs indicate that at the Safe Spaces, female participants had access to laptops and mobile phones
for their use when they came and visit. “This [location] was open but not 24-7”; They employed community guards
to make sure that the resources were not abused.” Inside these facilities, the issues discussed include: (i) sexual
and reproductive health; (ii) child marriage; (iii) abuse; (iv) gender-based violence (GBV) and victims of early
marriage; and (v) psychological issues.105 In Samangan and Herat, IP interviews indicated that some participants
asked for legal advice related to bad, badal, 106 and inheritance cases. In Samangan participants received legal
advice from the Safe Space staff, whereas in Herat, participants could be referred to service providers
(government entities). Five Safe Spaces were established, as planned, and a formal network has also been

created, namely five adolescent and youth networks.107 It should also be noted UNICEF is continuing another
Safe Space called the Women and Girls Safe Space in Bagrami (Kabul). 108
D.2.1.5 Community-based Livelihood Training
Community-based Livelihood Training, or vocational training, were originally intended to be executed in all
provinces, but the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs had a requirement that this training needed to last for six
months, but the curriculum was only for three months. Ultimately, one (out of five provinces), or Samangan,
executed this training. Interviews indicate that there were several vocational activities designed to lead to
occupations planned, including (i) tailoring;(ii); (iii) hand embroidery; (iv) dairy processing; (v) poultry raising; and
(vi) food processing from gardening (strawberries) to processing. The target for this programme component
was met as 360 female participants received training. The IP in Samangan supported 260 adolescent girls
and young women to receive a three-month tailoring course, after which the girls/women received sewing
machines and accessories to support future businesses. Poultry raising sessions were also conducted
for 100 adolescent girls.
D.2.1.6 Community-based Life Skills Training
A Community-based Life Skills Training (for girls only) training package was formulated and rolled out to 14,483
adolescent girls. This activity focused on life skills, namely (i) conflict resolution; (ii) how to spend money on basic
needs; and (iii) sanitation and hygiene. The revised target was to train a total of 10,710 adolescents, and so
the Life Skills Training exceeded its target.
D.2.1.7 Unconditional Cash Grants
The Unconditional Cash Grant intervention was initially planned to be implemented in both Ghor and Herat
provinces, which have some of the highest rates of OoS girls. The eligibility criteria for the selected households
were: (1) households that have at least one adolescent girl aged 10 to 15 years; and (2) be within the catchment
area of an Accelerated Learning Centre (ALC), no more than three-kilometre radius. The original design of the
Randomised Control Trial (RCT) targeted 2,000 participants; 1,000 would receive cash (treatment group), and
1,000 would not (control group). However, following a mapping exercise, the baseline process yielded a total of
about 1,000 households based on the eligibility criteria. This left the RCT design with insufficient power to pursue
and inform impact, necessitating an evaluation approach redesign. A programme decision was reached, on
technical and ethical grounds, to give benefits to all 1,000 potential beneficiaries and drop the segmentation of
treatment and control groups. Later, considering the perceived risks to implementation in Ghor, including limited
community sensitization resulting in misinformation and security concerns, it was agreed and discussed with the
donor that Unconditional Cash Grant activities should be suspended in Ghor, and implementation would only
proceed in Herat province. Hence, the Unconditional Cash Grant component was partially achieved, as the
target was revised to 950 beneficiaries to receive this financial assistance, but only 472 households with
adolescent girls received a grant for the equivalent of approximately USD 255. The challenges specific to
achieving this revised target are discussed in the section delineating factors influencing the successful delivery of
outputs.
D.2.1.8 Supplies to support schools
As noted earlier, in the last quarter, the programme was reprogrammed with an additional objective of providing
key supplies to adolescent girls affected by COVID-19. Therefore, the provision of supplementary hygiene
107 Data from Samangan, indicates that there used to be one Safe Space “Centre” in every district, but now there are only three, as the one in Dara-i-soof-i-payan was handed
over to the Department of Women’s Affairs in December, and has since closed its doors.
108 This facility is in a district that has a high rate of illiteracy and dropping out of girls as well as a high rate of child marriage and violence against women and girls. The safe
space is located in an area that is conveniently accessible to young women and adolescent girls. The safe space provides various educational, psycho-social support and
livelihood related services. A mentor program involves older women from the community to be role models to adolescent girls and also refer girls to the center. The Safe
Space is supported by several government departments and agencies: Directorate of Justice, Directorate of Education, National and international CSOs, Directorate of Labor
and Social Affairs, Child Protection Action Network, Department of Youth Affairs (Directorate of Information and Culture), Directorate of Public Health, and the Afghanistan
Independent Human Rights Commission.

materials and recreation kits to adolescent girls and boys in both formal (government) schools and CBEs was
intended to prepare adolescent girls to return to schools/Community Based Education (CBEs). This component
exceeded its target to support 50,000 adolescent girls. Specifically, a total of 46,048 Hygiene kits and
1,800 recreation kits were procured and distributed to formal schools and CBEs in five project provinces,
thereby affecting over 97,000 adolescent girls.109 (See figure below.) Finally, 270 Handwashing facilities were
provided to 135 girls’ schools in AWLI project districts.

OVERARCHING QUESTION: The extent to which the programme’s intended results were achieved at output
level.
Sub Question
What were the major factors influencing the successful delivery of outputs?
D.2.2 FACTORS INFLUENCING THE DELIVERY OF OUTPUTS
This section elaborates the positive and negative factors influencing the delivery of outputs, namely general
positive stakeholder response to the programme, community resistance overcome, the responsive programming
strategies used by the IPs to effectively communicate messages and engage communities, and constrained
outreach.
Stakeholder perceptions were positive, and it was reported that a strong feature of the
FINDING 5 programme was the premise of solving one’s own problems within the community, which may
have contributed to the unanimous request for the programme to continue.
109 This target was exceeded because, the hygiene kits, in particular, the handwashing stations supported a high number of students on a daily basis. Please see annex 14
for more information.
52
D.2.2.1 General Positive Perceptions about AWLI
With exception of a few stakeholders interviewed, each stakeholder group interviewed, duty bearers and rights
holders, expressed satisfaction with all of AWLI’s programme components. This positive response to AWLI
is reflected in the IPs in qualitative data, indicating that they were motivated and passionate about helping people
“solve their own problems”.
“Because this [project] was the first time, perhaps one of the projects that people directly participated
in solving their problems. In the past, the government or foreign institutions would come and solve the
problems of the people, but the goals of this project have been the participation of the people in solving
the problems of the people as well as the participation of the people in creating cultural, economic and
social context.” 110
Indeed, a Religious Leader at the community level not only confirms that the programme ought to resume, but he
expressed satisfaction with the Reflect Circle activities and its mandate of being rescued “from these hideous and
unaccepted customs.”
“Really these activities and reflection circles were very effective and we have worked on it. We have
sent some reports as well to the office. There were really good activities and people are really
satisfied. Even we proposed to office that they should continue their activities, and like our youngsters
to participate in these circles. Our girls who have a little literacy should participate and benefit from these
circles so hopefully our society could be rescued from these hideous and unaccepted
customs….”111
Another Religious Leader reflects on how things have changed for his village, even where there is Anti-
Government Elements ruling,
“Changes mean that in our village they don’t marry their daughter while she is underage, this is a change.
By God’s grace, giving girls to baad or to [a] complainant against blood money is not happening, it used
to happen when we were child[ren]. There is a district called X and Y…they used to hold early marriages
but now they are good even though it’s been 10 years that they are under [AGE] rule. Like they used to
give a 12 year old girl to marriage and they used to do it for a cow or a sheep. …..and there it become a
very big problem and it caused difficulties to girl and family. They changed now. It is not adequate that
these people have changed…In this village things [have not changed] 100 percent but anyway it good.112
A rights holder adolescent girl expresses her satisfaction with the programme and requests the programme to
continue,
“We were 100% satisfied. We want this programme to be renewed again. Our awareness was less
and more so that we can understand and become more aware. The reason for our satisfaction is that they
informed us [raised awareness].”113
The examples like the above, referring to all seven of the programme components and not just the Reflect Circles
and Community Dialogues, are innumerable throughout the qualitative dataset, thereby reflecting the extent to
which the programme participants were interested and engaged in AWLI’s interventions.

53
As AWLI’s premise was nontraditional, the IPs experienced community resistance in the
beginning of programme implementation, because talking about early marriage and the
promotion of girls’ education was very sensitive. However, the IPs communicated clear
FINDING 6
messages, which resonated with targeted communities, and their responsive implementation
strategies (such as crafting clear messages and recruitment of knowledgeable staff) laid the
foundation for community-level attitudinal and behaviour change.
The positive reflections about AWLI do not imply that there were no challenges. Indeed, there were many factors
which impeded programme delivery. The qualitative data from IPs, programme participants, and UNICEF staff
confirm that the IPs experienced resistance to the programme in the beginning. However, each IP used inclusive
and deliberate strategies to persuade key stakeholders to consider and accept the messages about the harmful
effects of early marriage and the interruption of education for girls.
D.2.2.2 Community resistance overcome
Community resistance took on various forms, ranging from arguments (protesting attitudes) to physical violence.
Stakeholders noted that because the topics were too sensitive, “the culture was very strong”, “you can’t talk about
this stuff”, one community insisted on changing “Safe Space” to “Safe Centre”, and another community requested
to change the name of Afghan Women Leader Initiative to something else, “because women cannot be leaders.”
Another level of challenges included expressing disapproval and creating barriers by associating the programme
with shame. For example, participant explained that some people think “People do not have food to eat….[have]
respect for the culture, the people, the religion”, and they question “ What are you saying to our ladies?”. Other
community residents present linked the “[the Safe Centre is] where …thoughts will get deviated,” and “It is a very
disgraced things for our culture that our girls go there.” Another level of protest, wherein people took action, was
also cited, as people did “not go to the “Safe Centre” in the beginning and an IP experienced damage to the project
car. While such initial resistance is not directly connected to adolescent girls, these underlying challenges
implicitly affect girls' autonomy and a community’s ability to tackle gender and cultural norms.

While the above examples illustrate the extent to which there was limited acceptance by target programme
beneficiaries initially, the IPs overcame these temporary setbacks with convincing messages disseminated
through a clear communication strategy and the use of innovations while working with communities.
54
D.2.2.3 Responsive programming
D.2.2.3.1 Crafting clear messages
An IP highlighted that another factor impeding the programme delivery was the fact that messages were not clearly
presented in the past, and so communities experienced challenges trying to understand what message was
trustworthy. For example, an IP noted, “As per the Convention on the Rights of the Child, they [girls] are supposed
to be 18. In the communities, however, they will say “Islam said this”, the “government says this”, and “the
foreigners say this….There is a need to give a clear message to [the] people! This needs to be proper, clear, and
transparent message.”114
A content analysis from data from KIIs and FGDs indicates that the messages used to communicate the harmful
effects of early marriage and terminating education were linked to four critical themes, namely 1) physical
(maternal) health ; 2) mental health; 3) building a future (or economic gains); and 4) religion. The table below
shows the examples of these communicated messages.
Table 10: Effective messages and their dissemination.
“The key is to link these sensitive “If you forced your daughter to marry, your daughter doesn’t

“Regarding the education of girls, the correct verse of the
Quran says: It is a presumption for men and women to get

he understands how to deal with people. The level of
knowledge of the region rises, and the society is moving
towards mobilization.” Male [2-5-AD-M3]
As illustrated in the table, the IPs used clear messages, negative and positive, in order to overcome the problem
of confusing messages from the past. For example, the harmful effects of early marriage and limited education
include death, living a life of misery, and having a baby who dies. The positive messages, however, were that
the Prophet Mohammed (Peace be upon Him), says that the rights of children and women should be affirmed,
and that to be educated is to know God better.

D.2.2.3.2 What messages were heard?

In addition to the prevention of “domestic violence”, mental health, not having a good future without education,
religious messages, and child/women’s rights, ranking lower, also helped to persuade the delay of a marriage and
the continuation of education. Finally, only a few of those interviewed believed that early marriage and the lack
of education would prevent one from having a financial footing.
In a few cases in Herat and Nangahar, respondents could not recall any messages linked to the harmful effects
of child marriage and interrupting education, which is normal especially for young adolescents. It is also noted in
the evaluation limitations that some respondents had difficulties recalling frequency of Community Dialogues and
Reflection Group activities.
A further examination of the messages for each province and by gender shows that with the exception of
Samangan, the messages about the importance of education rank the highest, although there does not appear to
be any relative difference between men and women in all three provinces. Messages connecting maternal health
issues to early marriage ranked the highest in Samangan.

However, after the importance of continuing education messages, maternal health-related issues (in Herat and
Nangahar) and education leads to a better life (Samangan) are the messages that women perceive most
important. The third highest ranking messages are “domestic violence” (Samangan), mental health (also in
Samangan), religious messages (Nangahar), and no real message (Herat). Finally, in Samangan, men perceived
that when marrying too young, the one’s life will have disputes and domestic violence, whereas in Herat and
Nangahar, the messages connecting early marriage to maternal health ranked second, followed by a split
between: (1) children and women have rights (Herat); and (2) religious messages (Nangahar). Annex 15,
Supplementary Data on Messages Heard, presents this data in separate for all three provinces.
The IPs responsive programming was effective with five community engagement
innovations, namely (1) crafting a clear message; (2) involving male messengers who are
FINDING 7
respected and trusted; (3) employing knowledgeable staff; (4) leveraging female community
champions; and (5) ensuring that a literate person took part in the Reflect Circles.
D.2.2.3.3 Community engagement approaches
The IPs used an effective community-based innovation to overcome challenges, which ultimately ensured that
participants understood, used, and spread the messages. Specifically, they made sure that messenger was
someone who was respected and trusted in the community. One IP explains, “we did not directly come to the
early marriage’s topic…it wasn't that effective because of its sensitivity”. A tool, a problem (and solution) tree,
was used to support the process of prioritizing community needs.116 When it was time to deliver the messages,
the IPs explained that their team included persons “who understood the religious affairs”. 117 One IP specified,
“among our staff, there was a person who memorized the Holy Qu’ran, and so they were able to be persuasive
[especially] with the religious leaders. “When people gathered, we started our programme with verses from the
Holy Quran, …after that, we would explain the goals of the meeting very briefly and would tell them that our
116 AWLI-ECW-Samangan FGD data; and AWLI-WASSA-Herat FGD data.
117 AWLI-ECW-Samangan FGD data
57
meeting would focus on one topic.” 118 Another innovation was the separation of men and women’s groups, so
that participants could thoroughly express their views. The IPs also had staff who were very skilled in their
respective districts and had worked in previous projects in the programme villages before. “They [the staff] knew
the people and the culture there.”119
In addition to having a knowledgeable staff, the IPs used another strategy which was working intently with
religious, community, and other powerful “actors” within the community. It was noted,
““
“The mullah…plays a very important role in the village. The village head [also]
is…influential…when responsibilities come from international institutions or government
at the provincial level.….The head of the village was influential. It appears that the OOuurr cchhaannggee aaccttoorrss
mullah may also require capacity strengthening in order to support the programme. For wweerree iinnfflluueennttiiaall
ffiigguurreess,, rreelliiggiioouuss
example, “the mullah Imam was [also] influential. Sometimes the mullah may not say
lleeaaddeerrss,, aanndd tthhoossee
the right thing, but the people of the same village are talking to the mullah, now we have
wwhhoo wweerree iinnfflluueennttiiaall
to work with [that] mullah…”120 ffiigguurreess iinn tthhee ssoocciieettyy
aanndd ggoovveerrnnmmeenntt
oorrggaanniizzaattiioonnss..
Moreover, it was also observed that many communities had their own female
EECCWW
champions, apart from those working for the AWLI programme, and the IPs worked with
these advocates, among other community members, to serve as messengers. For example, one female rights
holder admitted, “Old ladies used to say that it is good that we didn’t let our daughters to marry while being
underage.”121 Other advocates also included Provincial Government stakeholders, who “were eager to participate
in the project activities.”122 Hence, when the community’s input was integrated into the delivery of
messages, it appears that the programme was likely to be more effective. Given this finding, future
programmes ought to take into consideration this important programming approach.
Another strategy used to overcome challenges was working diligently to select stakeholders who could affect the
most change. This process is explained in the quote below,
“If I am the [leader] of the village and you come to me to list the beneficiaries, it is normal for me to give
you the name of my wife or aunt or uncle, no matter how much we say that we are only informing [we
have a selection criteria]…. For instance, selecting a beneficiary through the Department of Women's
Affairs, then through the chairperson of the district women's council, we [then] selected our
beneficiaries…“We gave [the leaders] our criteria. Our criterion was to be under the age of 19, from the
village, and also to be a woman….”
IPs noted, however, that “it is very difficult to select the beneficiaries”, as after the final selection, the IPs noted,
“…Then the elders would not give us a list of 20 people, but 40 people….”123 To overcome this challenge, one IP
noted that for reflect circles, the selection also included specific criteria, wherein the participants had to be
“literate, could connect easily with others, and could share their views without hesitation.” Other important
strategies highlighted that the staff person had previous experience in the village; although there was some
challenge there too. In the case of WASSA, the staff developed an “entry exam” to see if the person selected for
this role had the basic level of literacy.
In essence, the IPs initially experienced verbal and physical resistance from communities, because talking about
early marriage and the promotion of girl’s education were, and continue to be, very sensitive topics. Five key

innovations laid the foundation for attitudinal and behaviour change, and these positive practices are reflected
below.
1) Having a clear message. As seen, the messages may be negative and positive, including
how early marriage may lead to death, a life of misery, and having a baby who dies.
The positive messages, were that the Prophet Mohammed (Peace be upon Him), says
that the rights of children and women should be affirmed, and that to be educated is to
know God better. Based on a content analysis, There were three main messages which
resonated with the communities, namely that “education leads to a better life” (emphasized
by both men and women); “maternal health” issues (highlighted by women), and “there
POSITIVE
will be domestic violence if you marry too young” (primarily reported by men).
PRACTICES
2) Involving male messengers who are respected and trusted;
3) The IP employed knowledgeable staff who both knew the Quran and worked with powerful
community actors;
4) The IPs leveraged female community champions and government officials who wanted to
help; and
5) Ensured that a literate person took part in the Reflect Circles, so that they could follow up
on the results from the Problems and Solutions Tree.
D.2.2.4 Constrained outreach
One issue which emerged was that programme participants had not been exposed to more than one AWLI
component, and an IP explained why AWLI’s outreach was, in part, limited, a constraint that could not be
overcome. To gain support at the community level, IPs needed to work with the communities, stating that “There
would be some overlapping [of] people [beneficiaries], [but]….the community was saying that this would not be
fair if [some other beneficiaries] were involved in many different programme components.” Indeed, the
explanation for the limited programme dose was that community leaders would say, “No, those people have
already benefited from x project [in the past], and now, this family must get assistance.” 124
OVERARCHING QUESTION: The extent to which the programme’s intended results were achieved at the
output level.
Sub Question
To what extent were the programme interventions taken up by target programme beneficiaries?
D.2.3 UPTAKE OF PROGRAMME ACTIVITIES
There was an overall positive response to interventions as well as repeated demands for
scaling up and or continuing all activities. While it is recognized that Community-based
Livelihood Training was only implemented in Samangan, and Unconditional Cash Grants
FINDING 8
were only distributed in Herat, the Mini Media Clubs, Safe Spaces, Community-based Life
Skills Training were implemented equally to all provinces, but their uptake was remarkably
different between provinces.
The extent to which the Community Dialogues and Reflect Circle components were taken up by the community is
described at length in the Impact section. In this section, however, the uptake of the Community Based Livelihood
Training, Unconditional Cash Grants, Mini Media Club, Safe Space, and Community-based Life Skills Training is
presented in this section.
124 IP Log005.
59
D.2.3.1 Community Based Livelihood Training
One IP noted that the training “was the best activity of the project…..we were thinking of continuing this [activity],
because [of] the feedback from the community.” In other words, the community reception to the premise of this
programme component was so strong, the IP perceived that linking programme activities (or livelihood activities)
to the reduction of early marriage was a straightforward experience. One important strategy used was a clear
targeting approach, which focused on including the most vulnerable in the community. “We give 20 chickens to
those who did not have household heads and were poor….[A beneficiary’s] son was killed at war….[only] one or
two kids left in that family…we would give them chickens, so that they sell the eggs, each egg for 10 Afghan, 10
eggs will become 100 Afghan…..she [the mother] could [then] purchase pen and notebooks for her
schoolgirl….Creating this motivation was very good for them, especially in the chicken farms and tailoring. We
have worked a lot on creating this mindset.125 IPs also reported connecting the beneficiaries with markets.
Moreover, the data from interviews indicates that the adolescent girls who were exposed to “tailoring” training
continue to engage in this activity, and the parents from two families reported being pleased with their daughter’s
involvement in such activities.126
D.2.3.2 Unconditional Cash Grants
As noted earlier, there were plans to distribute non-conditional cash grants in both Ghor and Herat, but due to
community sensitization resulting in misinformation and security concerns, the programming in Ghor was not
implemented. Eligible households in Herat were identified through a listing exercise carried out in late 2019, and
then again verified in 2020, and included households with adolescent girls aged 10-15 in villages within four
districts of Herat Province (e.g., Enjil, Herat, Karrukh, and Zendajan). The value of the one-off cash grant of
19,500 Afghan (around US$ 255) was determined based on the average cost of education costs, namely
scholastic materials, uniforms, and general school-related expenses. UNICEF staff note that it was important to
devise a clear communication and dissemination strategy to support the cash grant component of the project.
Staff interviews also indicate that WASSA, organized various sessions with the communities with potential
beneficiaries as well as persons who were not likely to benefit from the cash grant. The Communications Strategy–
Cash Strategy Modality Document guided how WASSA undertook this important activity. There was great effort
not to create false expectations, and so during these sessions, communities were made aware of all aspects of
the cash transfer programme beforehand, discussing the objective of the unconditional, unrestricted cash grant,
and providing a full description of the eligibility criteria (having one adolescent girl aged 10-15 in the household).
While the criteria of residing within a three kilometers radius from a functional ALCs was another criterion, there
is limited evidence that indicates that this criterion was effectively executed and verified. There were no double
cash transfers, which means that if there was more than one girl in an eligible family, the family only received one
grant. As evidence of uptake, the PDM database results showed that 100 per cent of recipients reported
spending funds on education, although some mentioned spending funds on other items. Additional PDM
results indicate that most grant recipients felt safe at the cash distribution venue (100%), were treated with respect
(100%), and found the mechanism used to pay the money (direct cash through My Money) satisfactory (100%).
D.2.3.3 Mini Media Club
The data shows that the Mini Media Clubs in the government schools also had good uptake, and all children
benefitted from the services. The IP in Nangahar and Herat noted that the children share the messages discussed
at the club with their families when they go back home. This activity also provides additional support specifically
around early marriage. One school stakeholder noted that there was a need for additional funds to support the
scale up of this programme component, as it should be in every school. As part of programme sustainability, the
mini-media clubs have been handed over to Provincial Education Directorate in each province.

D.2.3.4 Safe Spaces
The data from the IPs in Samangan and Nangahar suggests that the Safe Figure 7: Shop selling female

functioned more like venues for Reflect Circles or awareness raising
meetings, as the communities in these provinces are more traditional. The
uptake for Safe Space in Herat, however, was overwhelming. The Safe
Space included a Counsellor who actively engaged adolescent girls
individually and in groups. The IP admitted that there were community
reservations, as psychosocial services initially, as these services were for
“crazy people”. The interest in this programme component appeared to also
have a ripple effect. The IP explained that three adolescent rights holders
met at the Safe Space, and now they use WhatsApp the communicate with
each other independent of the Safe Space. Hence, whenever one girl is “The environment is very different
experiencing a difficult time as it relates to early marriage-related issues, for a woman to go and ask a man
shop keeper to give her such
the other two girls independently support each other (without an intervention
hygienic products.” ECW
from the counsellor). The constraints preventing the full implementation of
this component include: (1) the lack of funds for transportation; (2) the
demand for psychosocial services is higher than what can be supplied; and (3) an absence of an appropriate
referral system, which prevents girls from easily seeing a physician, when needed.
D.2.3.5 Community-based Life Skills Training
With the exception of Samangan, the data collected from Herat and Nangahar had limited information about the
extent to which rights holders were interested in this programme component. However, this programme
component contributed to an unexpected positive outcome. Through the Life Skills Training, programme
participants “realized… what are the hygiene products for women.” Three women opened as small shop which
sells hygiene products and offers consultations to women with questions.127
In this section, the KEQ addressed was “To what extent were the programme interventions taken up by target
programme beneficiaries?” This evaluation has found that programme participants responded positively to the
Community-based Livelihood Training, Unconditional Cash Grants, Mini Media Clubs, Community Based Life
Skills Training, and Safe Spaces (in Herat). Given this evidence, there is, therefore, an opportunity for scalability,
albeit in a sustainable manner. This issue is further explored in the sustainability section.

D.2.4 FACTORS LIMITING EFFECTIVE PROGRAMME DELIVERY
The three main factors limiting effective programme delivery are: (1) partner capacity

insecurity.
127 AWLI-ECW-Samangan FGD data.
61
While established procedures and practices guided the implementation processes, it was noted that there are
three main constraints that prevented the effective delivery of programme activities. This section presents these
challenges.
D.2.4.1 Partner Capacity Limitations
Randomized Control Trials (RCT), a programme component dedicated to mapping and documenting the benefits
of that the Unconditional Cash Grant would have on targeted families, was incorporated into the programme
design solely for the purpose of conducting an impact evaluation.128 However, the responsible consultants
experienced significant challenges, and subsequently, there were delays when producing the baseline
assessment.129 The data from reports and KIIs with IPs and UNICEF confirm that the consultants were indeed
positioned to initiate programme activities, but the delays from the baseline assessment precluded the IPs from
working for almost one year.130 The details regarding the specific challenges and mistakes that led to delays and,
therefore, a limited baseline are not clear despite the evaluator’s intentional investigation in this area. As already
mentioned in the limitations section of this report, there are incomplete process details about implementation
during AWLI’s early phase (before and during 2018), and these information gaps have, in turn, limited reporting.
As a lesson learned, however, it is important to understand the underlying requirements for carrying out such a
narrowly defined data collection and analysis method. Likely topics to review thoroughly would include: (i) how to
develop good study questions; (ii) the data requirements; (iii) methodologies which are not conducive to certain
contexts like Afghanistan; and (iv) the competencies that the consultants or IPs must not only have to collect the
information, but also to refrain from creating false expectations within affected populations.131 UNICEF evaluators
also ought to have an open dialogue to programme managers the risks and benefits of using a certain method.
D.2.4.2 Government Policy on Livelihood Training
Originally, the Community-based Livelihood Training was intended to be implemented in all five provinces, but it
was only executed in one, Samangan. The Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs, and Martyrs and Disabled requires
livelihood programmes to have a six-month curriculum, but AWLI’s curriculum was only for three months. The
data from interviews with the IPs in Samangan noted that “government needs to have a clear idea of the concept.”
As noted above, there was a strong interest and demand for this programme component. However, qualitative
data from interviews with ActionAid, the IPs in each province, and UNICEF indicates that in spite of multiple rounds
of meetings and lengthy discussions with the government stakeholders, this activity was eventually dropped in
other provinces. Hence, based on the evidence, government stakeholders were not able to provide an exception
despite lengthy discussions. This programme shift was also partially due to COVID-19 movement restrictions and
limitations in the number of people who could gather at one time.132.
D.2.4.3 Insecurity
There are two types of delays linked to insecurity which influenced programme implementation, and ultimately,
the degree to which targets were met. For example, longer-term fighting created persistent security concerns,
whereby UNICEF had to close the outpost in the province of Farah on 31st December 2018.133 These areas were
simply inaccessible. In Ghor in 2020, UNICEF could not distribute Unconditional Cash Grants due to IP capacity
gaps and insecurity, and this directly led to UNICEF’s inability to meet that specific target. Similarly, monitoring
128 It should be known that there was a separate programme monitoring framework to monitor programme activities.
129 The responsible consultants carried out a listing exercise, which is a method used to generate an accurate, representative sample. The data from the listing exercise was
intended to feed into a second exercise, the comparison of baseline and the end line survey data. However, when the consultants experienced multiple challenges during
the baseline phase, the RCT component was eventually dropped.

62
results indicate that the number of Community Dialogue sessions were only partially achieved due to some villages
in Nangahar provinces being inaccessible due to insecurity and armed clashes.
Separately, there was also indiscriminate insecurity which documents confirm took place in all five provinces, and
this insecurity also directly affected programme implementation. For example, the insurgency in Nangarhar
province has been fragmented, and Anti-Government Elements have been active in Samangan province, which
even affected the conduct of this evaluation.134 Herat, a relatively calm province, also experiences such security
issues.
Nonetheless, these delays associated with insecurity, despite all the mitigation strategies, capacity limitations of
the consultants who experienced significant challenges conducting the baseline assessment, the lack of clarity of
the government policy on Livelihood Training, and movement restrictions linked to COVID-19’s all effectively
reduced the programme’s ability to fully meet its targets.
D.2.4.4 Effective management of conflict-related risks
It should be noted that while insecurity is a central theme mentioned throughout the qualitative database,
irrespective of the organization or programme staffing level, reports indicate that UNICEF used a mitigation
strategy during 2016-2017, wherein it is cited that “AWLI activities were implemented through UNICEF staff based
in Kabul, and communication advisors and district advisors based at provincial and district levels. UNICEF staff
and National Technical Assistants under the leadership of the respective UNICEF Chiefs of Zonal Offices also
facilitated the project implementation and monitored activities regularly.”135 Another example of conflict-related
risk management was at the provincial level. Data from FGDs with IPs indicates that the active Anti-Government
Elements adversely affected their ability to work in targeted communities. However, a content analysis from FGDs
with IPs showed that one strategy commonly used was to work with the facilitators who were residing in the
communities with active Anti-Government Elements, as they would communicate with the IPs when it was safe to
return. “In the last quarter of 2020, there was a big fight in one of our key districts and we had no access….They
called us back after the fighting subsided.”136

OVERARCHING QUESTION: The extent to which the programmme’s outputs were delivered in a timely and
cost-efficient manner.
Sub Questions
Were the programme outputs achieved according to the work plan and timeline?
Were the programme outputs achieved according to the budget and cost-efficiently?
What were the major factors influencing the efficient delivery of outputs?
In examining the budget allocations, with the exception of Community Dialogues, the distribution of Unconditional
Cash Grants in Ghor, programme outputs were achieved according to planned expenditures. However, this
section elaborates the key factors which impeded the efficient delivery of outputs, examining closely the: (1)
causes for delays in work plans and timeline; (2) issues related to monitoring; (3) cost-efficiency.
Management Structure of the Programme
The programme was headed by a UNICEF Youth and Adolescent Development Specialist. Through a Programme
Cooperation Agreement (PCA) with ActionAid, a Consortium Team Leader coordinated AWLI’s programme
activities which were implemented by three different non-governmental organizations, namely WASSA, OHW,

ECW in the five provinces. Within each NGO, funding partially or fully covered the engagement of a Gender
Advisor, Project Manager, Project Coordinator, District Officer, Community Officers (or facilitators), and a
Community Space Officer.138 A nominal contribution was provided to participants in Reflect Circles and other
community volunteers. For the Unconditional Cash Grant, an independent bank service, the Afghan Besim Mobile
Money Company (ABMMC), was used to provide cash directly to families.
Several challenges prevented the timely delivery of AWLI’s outputs, namely: (1) multiple
FINDING 10 changes in key leadership positions within UNICEF Afghanistan; (2) change in management;
(3) delays created by IPs; (4) the Pandemic; and (5) uncoordinated monitoring systems.
D.3.1 CAUSES FOR DELAYS IN WORK PLANS AND TIMELINE
D.3.1.1 Multiple changes in key leadership positions in ACO
Qualitative interviews and documents revealed there were multiple staff changes in the ACO, which inadvertently
affected programme management. For example, a review of donor reports and interviews with Senior Managers
indicates that there were three different country representatives, over five years, and three different AWLI
programme managers during the same period. While some of this change in staffing may be considered part of
UNICEF’s emergency duty station staff rotation policies and procedures,139 this reality tends to create delays in
the overall workplan. For future programmes, this dimension ought to be considered when designing and
planning programmes. In Afghanistan, even the programmes which focus on changing attitudes and
behaviors through IPs (based in the provinces) require close monitoring and supervision, especially if the
existing monitoring systems do not produce reliable and accurate monitoring data (to be discussed
below). It is also recognized that there are frequent rotations of IRoA officials, in Kabul especially, which may
compound the effects of UNICEF’s staff changes. Under these circumstances, however, these events may be
considered an opportunity to re-engage more actively with government.
D.3.1.2 Change in Management
Donor Reports also show that over the five years, AWLI’s Manager temporarily reported to two different
supervisors, namely the Education Section Chief and the Deputy Representative’s Office, although stakeholder
interviews indicate that the Child Protection staff assigned to carry out some of AWLI’s training and related follow
up activities reported to a Child Protection Manager. The benefit of having the AWLI manager report to the Deputy
Representative as a supervisor was that this person could recognize the holistic design of the programme and
ensure that the other sections would contribute to AWLI, thereby making programme management more efficient.
This means that the management lens was adolescent-centered and not solely focused on education or
protection. However, the challenge was when there was an office restructuring, and the AWLI Manager had to
report to the education section, under Girls’ Education Unit. Under these circumstances, inefficiencies increased,
as AWLI no longer benefited from a supervisor with a wider view of adolescent programming within the ACO.
Moreover, AWLI had to compete with the other priorities (girls’ enrollment in ALCs) for which that new supervisor
was responsible. These circumstances of selective monitoring and follow-up (part of programme management)
would inherently weaken the efficiencies that were already created. In essence, as reports and data from KIIs
indicate that change management occurred two times between 2015 and 2020, the multi-sectoral programme
was positioned in different sections within the Country Office’s programme portfolio.140 To maintain
efficiencies, AWLI should have been positioned under the supervision of a staff member who was not
likely to change (or leave).

140 Data from KII’s and document review show that initially, AWLI’s management started under the supervision of the Deputy Representative, and then it was shifted to the
Child Protection section around 2016 to 2017. In 2018, another change management occurred, repositioning AWLI in the Girls’ Education Unit.
64
D.3.1.3 Capacity Limitations
As noted earlier, partner capacity limitations also affected the delivery of the baseline data collection, which in turn
delayed the implementation of the programme. This delay prolonged the overall timeline and workplan.
D.3.1.4 The Pandemic
There are notable gaps in coverage for Community Dialogues, Unconditional Cash Grant, the Community-based
Livelihood Training, and the Community-based Life Skills Training was reduced to a limited scale (reduced
targets). An array of contextual challenges explains these gaps. Due to COVID-19, community-based activities
were suspended during March to June 2020, and IPs continued to conduct community-based activities, albeit with
fewer participants. Hence, this evidences why targets could not be met.
It was this circumstance which led to the proposal for reprogramming and the addition of the fourth objective,
focusing on the distribution of supplies. Another compounding factor was the cold climate, and so schools in Farah
and Ghor typically close (from March to September). While it is recognized that UNICEF is an organization
with strong capacity, and so a contingency, or back up plan would have helped to better navigate the
challenges linked to the Pandemic.
D.3.2 UNCOORDINATED MONITORING SYSTEMS
AWLI’s monitoring architecture consists of a database of beneficiaries exposed to various programme
interventions. This is a detailed excel sheet which includes the beneficiary names, contact information, gender,
language spoken, and location. Age, date of participant registration into the programme, and education levels
were not consistent variables in the file. This reservoir of information was used to produce quarter progress reports
generated by AAA (from WASSA, OHW and ECW), which, in turn, fed into donor reports and the RAM. In addition,
for the Unconditional Cash Grants, there was a PDM spreadsheet which included survey responses from 230
recipients (out of 472). There was no variable for the adolescent’s age in this spreadsheet.
To examine programme monitoring, the evaluation drew from the donor reports and other available UNICEF
documents (i.e., Annual Reports and budgets). However, when calculating the number of beneficiaries
independently, the Team Leader found that the numbers were not consistent with those presented in the donor
reports. While all programme components had gender disaggregated data, the available data was not
consistently separated by age.141 This data gap is critical to the strategic management of a programme that
focuses on adolescents, as the development outcomes between an 11 year old compared to a 17 year old are
very different.
Furthermore, the data from donor reports showed that the target for direct beneficiaries had been incorrectly
presented in the previous progress reports and was corrected based on the targets mentioned in the original donor
agreement. When the Team Leader calculated the number of beneficiaries reached throughout the programme’s
timeline, it appeared that there was slow, progressive participation from targeted adolescents from the beginning
of the 2018, finishing with a significant growth in 2020. When triangulating this finding with data from KIIs with
UNICEF and IPs, inconsistencies were evident. It is important for all programmes to have a system which
produces reliable and accurate monitoring data. While this situation could have been remedied with a
recommendation for stronger cooperation in data sharing between UNICEF and IPs, this recommendation has
already been made by a 2020 evaluation.142
141 Given that age was not a consistent variable in both the beneficiary or the PDM database, this observation is logical.

65
D.3.3 COST-EFFICIENCY
In response to the question about whether the programme outputs were achieved according to the budget, it has
been explained in effectiveness section that the outputs for two activities were only partially met (i.e., Community
Dialogues and Unconditional Cash Grants were suspended in Ghor). The margin for the target number of
Community Dialogues (4,463 out of a planned target of 5,000) is relatively small. Indeed, it was mentioned that
some villages in Ghor and Nangahar provinces were inaccessible due to insecurity. However, the partial
achievement of Unconditional Cash Grant distributions created a surplus in the budget. Initially, the overall target
for Unconditional Cash Grants was 3,000 beneficiaries, and this target was later reduced to 950 beneficiaries.
Ultimately only 472 households in Herat received a grant.
As explained earlier, when the Pandemic restricted movement and prevented participants from gathering into
groups, UNICEF sought solutions by reprogramming and adding the fourth objective focused on the distribution
of supplies. This was an adaptive and cost-efficient management approach. The procurement of recreation and
hygiene kits and handwashing stations was successful, as this component not only expended the surplus of funds,
but it also exceeded the planned target. Recall that the target was to support 50,000 adolescent girls in five
provinces, but it affected over 97,000 adolescent girls.
In summary, there were frequent rotations in UNICEF senior management (as well as the IRoA partners) from
2015 to 2020. The combination of AWLI’s inconsistent position within the programme portfolio, an unreliable
monitoring system, and the effects of the pandemic challenged the efficient use of available resources. However,
the surplus of funds was expended cost-efficiently by investing in the fourth objective focused on the procurement
and distribution of supplies.

OVERARCHING QUESTION: The extent to which the AWLI interventions can be scaled up, and the capacity
of Government partners to assume the responsibility of carrying these initiatives forward.
Sub Question
What strategies and interventions of the programme are most likely to be scaled up or sustained after the
implementation of the programme?
This section presents the process used for the official transitioning of AWLI activities to national partners, followed
by: (1) the key interventions not likely to be sustained; (2) the activities that beneficiaries indicated in; (3) and
factors facilitating and impeding scale-up.
The outputs from AWLI (Safe Spaces and Mini Media Clubs) have been handed over to
national partners, but certain activities are not likely to be sustained due to the pandemic and
limited community reception, especially in Nangahar and Samangan. Given the requests for
FINDING 11
the continuation of Community Dialogues Reflect Circles and high demand for Safe Space
services in Herat, however, targeted funding could facilitate their future continuation and scale
up.
D.4.1 PROCESS USED FOR OFFICIAL HANDOVER
Documents and data from KIIs indicate that in the beginning, the AWLI programme leveraged the use of provincial
level steering committees to secure an active participation of relevant Government departments from the: (1)
provincial Education Directorate (PED); (2) Department of Women’s Affairs (DoWA); (3) Department of Labour
and Social Affairs (DoLSA); and (4) Department of Youth Affairs (DoYA). Given this involvement, the data from
143 The extent to which the AWLI interventions can be scaled up, and the capacity of Government partners to assume the responsibility of carrying these initiatives forward.
66
FGDs with IPs also indicates that AWLI’s programme components have transitioned to the appropriate national
and provincial partners of PED (for the Mini-Media Clubs) and DoWA directorates and departments (for the Safe
Spaces).
D.4.2 INTERVENTIONS NOT LIKELY TO BE SUSTAINED
Data from FGDs IPs indicates that only a small number of the Mini Media Clubs in Samangan and one Safe Space
in Herat continue to function since the official handover. As for the Community Dialogues and Reflect Circles,
only a limited number of references within FGDs with IPs suggests that communities continue to meet
independently since the programme ended in December of 2020, albeit irregularly.144
While the Mini Media Clubs are embedded in government schools and are therefore under the management of
the PED, this activity is not likely to be sustained due to the cessation of instruction as a result of the Pandemic.
Similarly, the Safe Spaces in Nangahar and Samangan are not likely to be sustained in spite of their
management by DoWA, as they functioned like venues for other programme activities. While the Community-
based Livelihood Training had strong uptake in Samagan, the fact that there were challenges linked to
interpretations of government policy on Livelihood Training in general leads the evaluation to conclude that this
activity is also not likely to be sustainable. Finally, given the difficulties with Unconditional Cash Grants in Ghor,
it would be necessary for a comprehensive risk assessment in order to continue this intervention. Indeed, data
from the FGD with WASSA indicated that there were difficulties in spite of careful planning, namely: (1) organizing
multiple sessions to engage with communities with potential beneficiaries; (2) taking multiple steps not to create
false expectations; and (3) providing a full description of the eligibility criteria (having one adolescent girl aged 10-
15 in the household). IP capacity is therefore an integral to scale up. Nonetheless, given that this evaluation
has found a positive response to the Community Dialogues, Reflect Circles, and Safe Spaces (in Herat
only), there is an opportunity for scaling up these interventions in a sustainable manner.145
OVERARCHING QUESTION: The extent to which the AWLI interventions can be scaled up, and the capacity
of Government partners to assume the responsibility of carrying these initiatives forward.
Sub Questions
Have beneficiaries indicated any interest in seeing the programme scaled?
What would facilitate or impede the scale-up of the AWLI intervention?
D.4.3 BENEFICIARY INTEREST IN SCALED UP ACTIVITIES
AWLI has a complex design which is intensive, drawing on a great deal of intersectoral coordination. Though IP
and participant interviews indicate that Community Dialogue and Reflect Circle sessions are not likely to be
retained without additional finding, a content analysis shows that there are male and female champions based
within the community whose values are aligned with the AWLI’s objectives (priorities). This is especially in Herat
and Samangan. Moreover, an earlier section evidenced that programme participants requested that the
Community Dialogues and Reflect Circles continue. In the Impact section, it will be evidenced that there is an
opportunity for the Reflect Circles and Community Dialogues to be scaled up, so long as there is nominal
compensation to female and male volunteers (aged 18 to 22). The rational for focusing on young female and
male volunteers is elaborated in the impact section.
144 FDG ECW, FGD OHW, and FGD WASSA.
145 It should be noted that the Community-based Livelihood Training, Community-based Life Skills training, and Unconditional Cash Grants, were also positively received,
but the data is insufficient to recommend further support.
67
D.4.4 FACTORS INFLUENCING SCALE-UP
Government willingness is a critical to sustaining programme activities. As noted earlier, while there was strong
interest and demand for Community-based Livelihood Training, interviewed stakeholders confirm that this activity
was eventually dropped in all provinces except for Samangan, despite numerous meetings with the government.
A content analysis revealed that community interest, enthusiasm, and demand for service(s) are also key drivers
to successful programme delivery. The communities in Herat and Samangan provinces demonstrated their
interest in Community Dialogues, Reflect Circles. As evidenced, the Safe Space in Herat had a demand for
psychosocial services which exceeded what could be supplied.
As evidenced above, IP capacity is major factor which would impede scale up. For example, data from KIIs and
FGDs confirm that IPs had strong capacity to craft messages and communicate the harmful effects of early
marriage and terminating girl’s education. Conversely, the competencies of the other IP responsible for the
baseline data were lacking, as they could not manage community expectations regarding the Unconditional Cash
Grants. As noted above, the IP in Herat, WASSA, also confirmed the challenges of managing community
expectations.
Finally, pursuant to E/ICEF/2019/P/L.2146, the ACO’s Country Programme of Cooperation (CPC) will be ending in
2021, which also influences the scale-up of the AWLI intervention. Given this circumstance, the ACO has a limited
window in which to act before the new CPC begins.
It should be noted that prior to scaling up or continuing interventions, it is necessary to examine future needs,
including but not limited to: (1) what would entail the expanded coverage; (2) what would the contributions from
the government partners’ limited infrastructure and capacity to adopt the initiative; (3) whether the models for
Community Dialogues, Reflect Circles, and Safe Spaces should be further tested, perhaps adding other
components to the existing models; and (4) potential weaknesses and threats that might have negative (or
unplanned) impact as a result of scaling up of these activities.
D.5 Coherence147
OVERARCHING QUESTION: The extent to which other interventions with similar objectives complement or
contradict the programme and vice versa.
Sub Questions
How compatible was the AWLI programme with other interventions aimed at:
 achieving girl’s empowerment?
 increasing school attendance?
 reducing child marriage?
Include internationally-led, nationally-led, and local grassroots interventions.
This section presents an overview of how compatible AWLI is with global and national programmes focusing on
promoting girl’s education and reducing child/early marriage, within and outside of UNICEF. It should be noted
that this section does not consider interventions which aim to strengthen girl’s empowerment, because this is a
conceptual area that goes beyond the scope of AWLI’s specific interventions.
Though there is one global programme to end child marriage, evidence about grassroots or
FINDING 12 national initiatives designed to directly reduce child marriage was limited. However, there
are many national programmes aimed to encourage education for girls. While there are not

very many contradictions in these education programmes, the synergies specifically within
UNICEF-administered programmes are not explicit.
D.5.1 AWLI’S COMPATIBILITY WITH OTHER PROGRAMMES
A review of initiatives designed to reduce child marriage in Afghanistan yielded very limited information. Globally,
however, AWLI‘s structure is somewhat consistent with the preventative measures used by the Global
Programme to End Child Marriage. Administered by UNICEF and United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA),
this four-year programme, worth over USD 127 million dollars, is executed in Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia,
Ghana, India, Mozambique, Nepal, Niger, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Yemen, and Zambia.148 Within Afghanistan, in
Badghis and Banyam provinces, the Improving Adolescents’ Lives in Afghanistan (IALA) programme focuses on
empowering adolescents by enhancing their knowledge, improving their access to information and supporting
their rights to healthier and safer lifestyles. It has three key objectives: (1)reducing child marriage; (2) lowering the
incidence of teenage pregnancy; and (3) enhancing female educational outcomes through increased secondary
school (re)enrolment.149
Similarly, data from a stakeholder interview and documents from the Aga Khan Foundation (AKF Afghanistan)
confirm the existence of several education programmes aimed at increasing girls school attendance.150 Currently,
the focus is on community development in governance, civil society, market development, natural resource
management, infrastructure, health and education. Working under the government’s qualification framework,
AKF’s education programmes concentrate on school-based education from kindergarten through twelfth grade.
In addition, the Girls’ Education Support Programme (GESP) provides support for AKF’s existing education
programmes. The programme started with the coordination of the District Education Department where AKF
identified remote schools where girl’s enrolment was low and needed GESP’s support. The main goal of this
programme was to increase girls’ access to school and create an encouraging environment to keep them in school,
both in terms of more supportive teaching practices and the commitment of their communities and the school
system to further their education. These programmes are designed to:
 Decrease dropout rates (through children’s rights to education awareness);
 Increase graduation rates by promoting girl’s enrolment;
 Increase attendance at and success in the Kankor exam. AKF conducted Kankor preparation courses which
provided supplementary support for students to help them familiarize themselves with the Kankor syllabus and
exam-writing skills.
 Increase the number of female teachers by transferring teachers from urban to remote areas; and
 Better equip and resource schools and classrooms through physical infrastructure.151
Finally, one of UNICEF’s education programmes, the Girls’ Access to Teacher Education (GATE) programme,
specifically increases access to education for girls by supplying female teachers, which is compatible with AWLI.
The multi-purpose adolescent groups (MAGs), an entry point to work with girls on protection-related issues, are
also compatible with AWLI.152

D.5.2 SYNERGIES, LINKAGES, CONTRADICTIONS & DUPLICATIONS
Many of the programmes from the AGF and UNICEF have similar designs and outcomes linked to girl’s
empowerment and education, but few are dedicated to the reduction of early marriage. Indeed, data from KIIs
with IRoA, IPs, and UNICEF confirm that AWLI’s premise of raising awareness about the harmful effects of early
marriage through a multi-sectoral approach is unique.153 Moreover, based on the qualitative data, there do not
appear to be any contradictions. In fact, AWLI has linkages and synergies with ongoing UNICEF programmes
in other sectors (i.e., education, gender, and WASH). Several interviewed staff members cited specific examples
of programmatic linkages. AWLI’s activities were linked with those associated with the GATE, and “this was good
result.” The WASH programme, targeting schools and teachers, focuses on menstruation health among
adolescent girls. As menstruation can prompt action for an early marriage, the WASH programme staff inspired
teachers to raise awareness about the harmful effects of early marriage. Finally, the staff member responsible
for the provision of technical assistance in gender noted that “it only makes sense to talk about maternal health
issues with adolescents” when conveying messages about the harmful effects of child marriage and pregnancy.
In the effectiveness section, it has been evidenced that the maternal health is a major concern among programme
participants in the sampled provinces, and so those messages are very effective.154
Since AKF and UNICEF’s programmes are located in different geographical areas, there is little duplication in the
areas of girl’s education and empowerment. However, the Adolescent Portfolio Evaluation noted duplications
within UNICEF’s programmes, and this could be remedied with a ToC for adolescent programming. According to
the Adolescents in Afghanistan: A Portfolio Evaluation with a Gender Lens (2015–2019) Evaluation, this insightful
gap has already been observed, and their recommendation was to “generate a full-fledged Theory of Change for
adolescent work in Afghanistan, which should be a collective effort with inputs from all different ACO sectors to
ensure the appropriate synergetic work across the board.”155
D.6 Impact
OVERARCHING QUESTION: The extent to which the project has increased secondary school enrolment of
out of school adolescent girls and changed social behaviours and attitudes towards child marriage.
Sub Questions
What difference has the project made in changing perceptions of the target groups on child marriage?
How successful has the combination of social mobilization activities and cash transfers been on increasing
secondary enrolment rates of adolescent girls and changing social behaviour towards child marriage vis-à-vis
social mobilization interventions alone?
How has raising awareness on the harmful effects of child marriage contributed to adolescent girls being able
to attend school and subsequently enhanced their chances of delaying marriage?
D.6.1 EVALUATION QUESTIONS NOT FULLY ADDRESSED
It should be noted, however, that the KEQ, “How successful has the combination of social mobilization
activities and cash transfers been on increasing secondary enrolment rates of adolescent girls and
changing social behaviour towards child marriage vis-à-vis social mobilization interventions alone?”
cannot be comprehensively addressed. The interviewed families with adolescent girls who received
Unconditional Cash Grants did not participate in social mobilization activities. Therefore, the implication is that

the lack of data did not permit a two-group comparison of (i) those who had only participated in SBC; with (ii) those
who had received a grant and participated in SBC activities.
Moreover, the KEQ, “How has raising awareness on the harmful effects of child marriage contributed to
adolescent girls being able to attend school and subsequently enhanced their chances of delaying
marriage?” was also not fully addressed due to a lack of evidence that connects the number of delayed
marriages with relative increases in the number of adolescent girls attending secondary school. Nonetheless, a
finding in this section partially addresses this KEQ, as it describes how religious leaders take action and support
the promotion of education for many girls, but they may be less action-oriented when it comes to holding
community members to account in refraining from early marriage.
This section describes the: (1) differences that AWLI has made in beneficiaries’ lives; (2) the conditions under
which girl’s education has been continued; (3) where early marriages have been delayed/ended; (4) if beneficiaries
used child/women’s rights reasoning to raise awareness about the harmful effects of discontinuing education and
early marriages; (5) whether AWLI influenced girls to make life choices; and (6) intended/unintended effects of
AWLI on community/household tensions.
While only a small number of participants expressed that after experiencing the programme,
their perspectives had changed, there are many examples from rights holder young males
and females and duty bearer parents, wherein their raised awareness through interpersonal

communications [reportedly] led them to taking some form of action. However, adolescents
(ages 11-17) and community and religious leaders appear to be less action-oriented for
different reasons.

does not confirm that there was necessarily an attitude change from the past compared to the present.
Specifically, from the qualitative data, only a small number of participants expressed that after experiencing the
programme, their perspectives had changed. Four examples of observations wherein the respondent reported a
change in mindset (see figure below). The above observations, from Community Leaders, an older father and
mother, and a young person, highlight how practices from the past have changed in the community and from
within themselves.
D.6.1.2 Examples from four stakeholder groups
In response to the question about “What difference has the project made in changing perceptions child marriage?”,
the qualitative data confirms that some stakeholders have experienced or/and observed changed attitudes within
themselves or and their communities. The interview data from rights holder young males and females includes a
considerable number of examples where they have spoken up and taken advantage of opportunities to convince
others in their families or communities to delay a boy’s and girl’s marriage or encourage the continuation of their
education.156
In recalling the specific steps within the ToC, IF the rights holder [who make be at risk of child marriage] receives
opportunities through the provision of information and capacity development activities (e.g., life skills training,
conflict resolution skills, messages about continuing education), THEN an action takes place. There are two
actions expected to follow, namely (i) she is expected to express herself (or speak up) and; (ii) exercise having

choices regarding marriage and sexual and reproductive health. It appears that these two actions (self-
expression and making choices) do not follow in sequence.
D.6.1.2.1 Examples from young rights holders (aged from 18 to 24)
The qualitative data from young rights holders, duty bearer parents, and community and religious leaders indicates
that once messages were accepted, these rights holders exercised their rights and took action within their own
families by encouraging and motivating others to change their practices. The gear figure below is intended to
highlight how the community stakeholders are interconnected. Each stakeholder group’s data is color coded to
help clarify to convey the perspective of each stakeholder. Figure 9 shows the data for rights holder young males
and females (ages 18+).

“There was one of our relatives who wanted to get her daughter married underage
and the girl did not even agree about it. We told them that they should ask the girl if
she is not happy about it then she should not marry. When we told them, they

We talked with my cousin. My cousin was taken from school by her father

religious education are included in their lessons. Now they have re-included
her in grade 9. 2-5-AD-F6.
Numerous examples of these actions include someone who has been exposed to the programme approaching
another person within their family or community circle (directly or indirectly). For example, “we went to her father
and told him”, “I went to them to stop them..but they didn’t listen to me, so I told my father about it.”; “I told my
brother to convince him”; “She was in the 10th grade, then he expelled her from school, my brother called my
father from Iran and told him that my sister could continue her studies”; “and then I went to his mother. I told
her mother that I had gone to a seminar today on violence against women who talked about early marriages”; and
“Mullah X explain[ed] to us….that a sister and daughter should not be married early….the child should not be

D.6.1.2.2 Examples from adolescent rights holders (aged from 11 to 17)
The above quotes are from young males and females, and it is evident that these individuals are proactive and
outspoken. The quotes from adolescent girls (below), however, appear to be more soft-spoken and less action-
oriented with,
Figure 10: Qualitative data-adolescents.

“[Female cousin] was very young and the boy was an old man. There were a
lot of problems in [her] life, there were no mothers-in-law or fathers-in-law,
but there would be a lot of quarrels with her husband…..She would tell her
uncles (and my father was also one of her uncles)…She said, ‘Look, I can't

because I am young”. From then on, I realized that when I grow up
enough, I can do these things.” 3-8-AD-F3 (age 13)
“The one who is educated has a higher social class and the one who has not,

Additional full quotations are located below.

and told them not to do this [to me], this is wrong.” 1-3-AD-F7 (age 15) 3-7-AD-F1 (age 16)
Briefly, the older males and females interviewed (aged between 18 to 24) are more action-oriented, intervening
within the family dynamics of others-either indirectly or directly, whereas the younger adolescents (aged between
11 to 17) are comparably less likely to follow through with action. One explanation for the constrained self-
74
expression is that younger participants may be still in the process of forming an opinion and may have not reached
a point of exercising a choice regarding marriage or sexual and reproductive health (or even convincing someone
else to change their practices). The perspectives of younger participants appear, however, to be forming. For
example, the above participant’s disclosure about “From then on, I realized that when I grow up enough, I can do
these things,” suggests that there is a process of forming an opinion taking place (or the initial phases of
verbalizing her own opinion) but may not have reached a point of deciding to act.
D.6.1.2.3 Examples from duty bearer parents
When testing the logic for the ToC for parent duty bearers, the reasoning for the conceptual framework also holds
true. That is, IF the duty bearer parents engage in, and in turn promote a supportive environment, through SBC
activities (which include (i) raising awareness and (ii) stimulating dialogue about the negative consequences of
early marriage and ending education), THEN the parents may demonstrate positive attitudes and favorable
behaviours regarding gender equality, which includes exercising their authority, delaying early marriages, or and
supporting the pursuit of secondary (or higher) education.

As indicated earlier, the content analysis of the qualitative data set has several examples, wherein once messages
were accepted, duty bearer parents also took decisions within their own families and communities by helping
others to change their behaviour. One respondent notes, “The first thing I did was I implement it [the programme]
on myself. My cousin [was] supposed to be married to me. She was younger than me. Then I didn't accept it…”157
Several other examples include cases where “they wanted to make a girl marry in her early age, the girl was a
student in her seventh or eighth grade of school…Then we went to her father and told him to let his girl study
and that it’s a bad habit or forcing girls”; “when someone wants to get married, the boy and girl both are expected
to know their rights and responsibilities”; As a teacher….we always talk about the harms of early marriages
and we try to save our society from this disaster….and this is everyone’s responsibility”158; and “Now people are

responsibility to delay marriages and promote education for boys and girls.160

After assessing the ToC for community and religious leaders, it appears that there are mixed results. As noted
earlier, the awareness raising messages take on multiple forms, namely health, mental health, the important
investment of education, and religion. Naturally, the content analysis from community and religious leaders
emphasize the links among early marriage and stopping education with religious messages, or what is considered
acceptable in the Quran. There appears to be goodwill in showing support to the project, as mullahs and
community leaders help to transmit messages during meetings, and as fathers, they take a stance and allow their
own daughters to go to school.161
Figure 12: : Qualitative data-community and religious leaders.
“One day the focus of the program was about early marriages. Then, I came
back to the mosque I told people about it….After three days, I was invited
to an engagement ceremony….I asked that what is going on? …They said
that we engaged him with that person’s sister.
I told them that she is too young and underage. This girl doesn’t have a
father, she is under guardianship, and she doesn’t have a right to select a
solicitor. ….. they should let her become mature enough ….Both families
were good people so they decided that they will wait for three years to do the
marriage. 1-2-RL1 56 year old male
“A father who wanted to marry his daughter informed us as Qaari Sahib
[someone who has memorized Quran] and religious leader. We went with
the head of the council, village head, and relatives, and we canceled the
girl's marriage.” 2-5-RL1 54 year old male
“People had awareness specially in forced and underage marriages, which
have faced problems in many places and have caused conflicts between the
region and relatives. People were also informed on education. 1-3-CL1 36
year old male
However, there is limited evidence that the AWLI’s awareness raising components about the harmful
effects of child marriage have, indeed, contributed to the delay of marriages.162 That is, the messages
appear to be effective, but behaviour change is limited, particularly when it comes to the community and religious
leaders taking advantage of their power to hold others in the community to account for (specifically) early marriage.
There is comparably a larger amount of evidence that the programme has helped many stakeholders within the
community and family to take action and support the promotion of education for many girls.
To summarize, the KEQ was “What difference has the programme made in changing perceptions about child
marriage?”. When validating the ToC, there are countless examples in the qualitative data where young rights
holder males and females and duty bearer parents have spoken up and taken the following action: (i) informed
others of the harmful effects of early marriage and discontinuing girls’ education; (ii) intervened in a planned
marriage with and without success; (iii) convinced a family member to let a girl continue her education. This
evidence confirms that some stakeholders have experienced or/and observed changed attitudes within

themselves or and their communities. As this stakeholder group is action-oriented, they would make strong
candidates to participate in the Reflect Circles, in the event that this intervention were to be scaled up.
There is only a partial fulfillment of the intermediate outcomes in the ToC, however, because the data from
adolescents and Religious and Community Leaders does not explicitly show a difference attitudes or behaviour.
Compared to the young rights holder males and females and duty bearer parents, adolescents (between 11-17)
are comparably less action oriented. They are not intervening within the family dynamics of others-either
indirectly or directly. One explanation is that adolescents may be still in the process of developing an opinion and
may have not reached a point of exercising a choice regarding marriage or sexual and reproductive health.
It is the behaviour of the Community and Religious Leaders which allows one to conclude that the ToC’s
Intermediate Objectives are only partial met. Indeed, there are examples where the Community Leaders and
Religious Leaders take action and support the promotion of education for many girls. However, there are only a
few examples where these stakeholders take action by using their power to hold others in the community to
account for (specifically) early marriage. Given this conclusion, AWLI’s awareness raising components
about the harmful effects of child marriage have and discontinuing education are, indeed, effective, but
the evidence does not support that the programme contributed to the delay of marriages.163

Sub Question
Have they delayed marriage by raising awareness on the rights of adolescent girls to education, or for other
reasons?
While older males and females (aged between 18 to 24) and duty bearer parents were action-
oriented , demonstrating a sense of responsibility to delay marriages and promote education,
the extent to which they use women’s rights or child rights reasoning is uncertain. However,
FINDING 14
Community and Religious Leaders were more likely to be aware of the women and child rights
terminology, yet they were less likely to take action by using their powers to hold others in the
community to account.
As already mentioned, older males and females (aged between 18 to 24) are more action-oriented, directly
speaking up and intervening within their own family dynamics or that of others, and so several examples (noted
above) show how early marriages were either prevented or delayed. The extent to which they use women’s rights
or child rights reasoning is uncertain, however. There were very few examples where older males and females
drew attention to injustices by using rights-based terminology. Similarly, examples presented above show that
duty bearer parents also demonstrate a sense of responsibility to delay marriages and promote education for boys
and girls. There were no examples of the use of rights-based language within this stakeholder group, however.
Surprisingly, the Community and Religious Leaders were aware of the terminology of women and children having
rights, but, as illustrated above, there are some examples where they take action and support the promotion of
education for girls. There are only a few examples, however, where these stakeholders take action by using their
power to hold others in the community to account to delay or stop an early marriage.

Has the project made a difference in adolescent girls’ lives by increasing their ability to make life choices?
D.6.2 INCREASED ABILITY TO MAKE LIFE CHIOCES
In referring back to the ToC, it does not appear that AWLI has made a major difference in adolescent girls’ lives
as it relates to increasing their ability to make life choices. The Intermediate Outcomes for adolescents may have
been too ambitious. As noted in the data, the adolescents (aged between 11 to 17) are at the age and
developmental stage of their lives, where they are only beginning to have or/and express an opinion. The data
shows, for example, that younger participants are in the process of forming their own opinions. It is also likely
that one main ToC assumption was not met, which is that individuals are sufficiently supported by peers, family,
and community to engage meaningfully. If this holds true, some of these adolescents may have their opinions,
but they may not yet have had the opportunity or reached a point where they can exercise a choice regarding: (1)
their sexual and reproductive health; (2) early marriage; and (3) the continuation of their education.
It is important to recall that when QARA faced a major challenge in the Samangan Province, where there was
insecurity in all three sampled districts, QARA conducted telephone interviews (in place of face-to-face interviews)
in two districts which were inaccessible (e.g., Roi-do-ab and Dara-i-soof-i-bala), but the district of Feroz Nakhcher
replaced Dara-i-soof-i-payan. Even with these efforts, however, the data was not sufficient to validate the ToC
and link programme results between: (1) Community-based Livelihood Training (and the ensuing entrepreneurial
activity) and (2) a rights holder’s ability to make lifestyle choices.
Different programme components have made a difference in the lives of adolescent females
(namely Unconditional Cash Grants and Community-based Livelihood Training), but because
FINDING 15
the programme participants are so young, it is uncertain if the programme helped rights
holders to make “life choices”.
When validating ToC, after the rights holders have accepted

problems that were creating tension in the home.164 As the average age of the recipients (adolescent girls)
was age 12, it is evident that the funds were not spent exclusively on the child, but the funds were also invested
in the household. Fifty-six percent reported that the grant significantly improved their living conditions.
Ultimately, the cash grant mechanism is a short-term remedy to support girl’s education, but the extent to which
the girls’ voices are heard, especially young ones, and are able to take decisions is not confirmed. For
example, the PDM results showed that 83 per cent reported that the parents decided how the money would be
spent. It is also not clear if the cash support facilitates the child’s negotiation with their parents and their
elders.
The data from one interview recounts the story about how the funds were used to support a family with five
children. Although the mother was grateful for the funding, she admitted “I am illiterate….My husband is an old
man, he can't work.” Therefore, when the children ask for money to go to school, she noted They go to school
and say, "Mother, give me ten afghanis…I look at their faces and cry.” Hence, while the grant is intended to
support the adolescent girl in making life choices (related to her education), the grant is allowing the parents, the
families to make those choices on her behalf. Ultimately, this grant enables “buying time. Sometimes the two
years’ time makes the difference for the adolescent…. The family can do something that they may not have been
planning [to do] but then it can come in and help them make do with a certain situation.“165
In conclusion, this section presents the results after validating the ToC after having received an Unconditional
Cash Grant. After the rights holder’s family received the grant, the evidence shows that the funds were spent on
education-related items. However, the rights holder’s ability to fulfill the intermediate outcomes of exercising
choices regarding her education and family’s livelihood are not met. In this case, the ToC did not well represent
the outcome that can be expected from an Unconditional Cash Grant. The likelihood of whether the rights holder
is any closer to making such decisions may also be limited, simply because the adolescent was very young and
still developing her opinions. Basically, in the short-run, the Unconditional Cash Grant helps to reduce the
cost/income barrier to a girl’s education, but it does not necessarily directly address issues of self-confidence,
skills, or power of the adolescents to make decisions.

What were the effects, intended or unintended, that the programme had on sources of tension and sources of

The unintended factors, influencing programme effectiveness include the severe reduction of

was a victim of early marriage. However, these circumstances, which reduce and create
tensions, were unforeseen and therefore could not be monitored or mitigated.
In response to the KEQ “What were the effects, intended or unintended, that the programme had on sources of
tension and sources of cohesion in the 20 districts where it worked, and how were these monitored over time?”,
a content analysis indicates that in Samagan, AWLI reduced community tensions with the severe reduction of
the dowery in Samangan. One participant explains that “Back then, a groom was compelled to pay for everything
164 1-2-AD-F8-GR; 1-2-AD-F1-GR; 1-1-AD-F1-GR; and 1-3-AD-F1-GR.
165 [Log 014]
79
which accounted for around 100,000 [Afghan] (roughly USD 1,291) or more. But now it has become very simple.”
If a young person wanted to get married, he had to travel out of the country and work for at least five or six years
in order to save the money and to get married. Through the AWLI project, however, it was established that the
bride price could not exceed 300,000 Afghan (roughly USD 3,870).166 This example, where in AWLI effectively
helped to better negotiate the dowery, was unique and only took place in Samangan.
At the family level, two critical circumstances, or situations, increased tensions, thereby obstructing the
effectiveness of AWLI’s programme components. That is, the programme is not likely to show positive results
under these specific conditions. A theme emerged indicating that “when [a] father was an addict”, the likelihood
of that daughter being married off or taken out of school is highly likely. This means that, when the family is
experiencing a crisis of drug addiction or a debt, the early marriage is unlikely to be delayed. A few examples
were raised about “cases” in the community where a father who was a drug addict “wed his daughter to a very old
aged man, and took six hundred thousand rupees.”167 A similar situation occurred when the father had a debt.
A respondent recounted a story about how he tried to intervene with a man who was attempting to “give his
daughter away to a 35-year-old man. The respondent noted that the many told him “if you want to stop this [early
marriage] from happening then give me 20,000 Afghan, because I’m in debt and I [have]….to pay my debt …..”
He told the respondent that “this poverty and humiliation is the cause that I’m giving my girl who is only in her 6th
grade to a man who is almost 35 years old…. I [don’t have] the ability to pay my debt and I have to give my girl to
him.” Unlike the other cases, this respondent’s actions did not delay the marriage, because he did not have the
money to pay off that person’s debt, although the action was that he “told him many times, but he told us about
his poverty and distress and said that [he couldn’t do anything.” 168
Another compounding variable is when a daughter who weds at a very young age and does not continue school,
it seems that her position in the family and society becomes very vulnerable.169 That woman becomes a duty
bearer mother who is isolated with a strong likelihood of making poor decision, especially if she lives in poverty.
Indeed, she may be an active participant in perpetuating the cycle of early marriage. That is, when young
illiterate rights holder daughters fallen prey of the harmful effects of early marriage become vulnerable duty bearer
mothers, they are likely to be the ones perpetrate the situation by marrying off their daughters at an early age.170
Such a finding has implications for targeting participants in future gender equality programmes. Young illiterate
mothers fallen prey of the harmful effects of early marriage also become perpetrators by marrying off their
daughters at an early age, thereby continuing the vicious (generational) cycle.
D.6.4 MONITORING OF SOURCES OF TENSION/COHESION
From the evidence available, there was no indication that there was programme monitoring of the above-
mentioned factors that could cause community tensions. As AWLI reduced community tensions in Samangan
and exacerbated tensions, unintentionally, within the family, it does not appear that IPs were monitoring such
occurrences during implementation. Moreover, there is no evidence suggesting that the programme exacerbated
gender inequalities and or rights violations.
In sum, the data shows that AWLI’s unintended effects were a severe reduction of the dowery in Samangan, and
this should be heralded as a positive finding. Moreover, a content analysis shows that, at the family level, tensions
may flare when the patriarch is addicted to drugs and when the matriarch was a victim of early marriage. As
these negative circumstances were unforeseen, they were not monitored or mitigated.

E. CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, AWLI, with a budget of USD 6,949,735.23, was a three-year programme but was executed over
five years. The programme focused on redressing gender inequalities, changing harmful gender norms and
practices (perceptions and terminating education and early marriage), supporting girls and disadvantaged people
from diverse population groups (illiterate women, OoS girls, poor families, and hard to reach communities), and
removing structural barriers (by supporting Community -based Livelihood Training and increasing market access
for entrepreneurial activities). By partnering with AAA, WASSA, OHW, and ECW, the ACO effectively leveraged
their influence, innovations, and expertise to realize children’s rights at scale. Through this programme, UNICEF
has successfully supported Afghanistan’s progress in raising awareness about child and women’s rights. In using
the theory-driven and utilization focused evaluation approaches, part of evaluating AWLI’s adolescent
programming model is to validate the intermediate outcomes within the ToC, examining: (i) the programme theory;
(3) its effects at the individual, community, and institutional levels; and (3) underlying assumptions. More specific
conclusions are presented below.
E.1 Relevance
This programme was highly relevant for Afghanistan, given that adolescents suffer a great deal from violence and
abuse, and the insecure environment perpetuates harmful cultural and traditional practices. Both girls and boys,
especially those who are OoS and whose livelihoods are not prioritized within their families, are even more
vulnerable in Afghanistan’s conflict context. The rural and hard to reach communities where AWLI was
implemented have the custom of collecting a dowry, or “bride price”, which is a form of family financial survival,
and AWLI was developed to address early marriage in these provinces. While this programme’s design came
from an evidence-based assessment of national priorities at the provincial levels, regional research trends, and a
thorough alignment with both national strategies and UNICEF’s Strategic & Action Plans, the strength of this
programme was that it used a multi-sectoral approach. Many programmes with a gender inequality goal frequently
adopt implementation strategies that isolate girls and women, whereas AWLI’s design acknowledged the social,
economic, political, cultural, and religious drivers of child marriage. However, the findings illustrate that AWLI
could have been more inclusive, focusing on girls and boys, as the inclusion of men and boys tends to result in
greater programme sustainability with longer lasting behavior change.
E.2 Effectiveness
There was a total of seven interventions in five provinces and 20 districts.171 The AWLI programme delivered
almost all of its planned outputs. While the number of adolescents that the programme reached exceeded its
target, the number of girls directly experiencing the programme was only 82 percent (or 164,207 out of 200,000)
of its target. Apart from Community Dialogues and Unconditional Cash Grants, all of the activities met their
targets.
Stakeholders reported that a strong feature of the programme was the premise of solving one’s own problems
within the community, which may have contributed to the unanimous request for the programme to continue. The
positive perspectives about AWLI do not imply that there were no challenges. Indeed, there were many factors
which impeded the delivery of outputs. IPs initially experienced verbal and physical resistance from communities,
because AWLI was a nontraditional programme and talking about early marriage and the promotion of girl’s
education was, and continues to be, very sensitive. In examining the a few of the different strategies used by the
IPs, it has been evidenced that these NGOs overcame initial adverse circumstances (tensions within the
community). The IPs responsive programming was effective with five community engagement innovations. The
use of clear messages, negative and positive, helped to overcome the problem of confusing messages that
communities had heard from the past. The strategy of acknowledging the power of the messenger resulted in
171 They included: (1) Community Dialogues; (2) Reflect Circles; (3) Safe Spaces and Formal and Informal Networks; (4) Mini Media Clubs; (5) Community-based Life Skills
Training; (6) Unconditional-Cash Grants; and (7) Community-based Livelihood Training.
81
partnerships with mullahs, and other religious leaders, and community leaders, which in turn translated into
community / peer acceptance. IPs also employed knowledgeable staff, leveraged female community champions,
and required that a literate person took part in the Reflect Circles, so that they could follow up on the results from
the Problems and Solutions Tree.
While the Mini Media Clubs, Safe Spaces, Community-based Life Skills Training were implemented equally in all
provinces, the Community-based Livelihood Training was only implemented in Samangan, and the Unconditional
Cash Grants were only distributed in Herat. The target programme beneficiaries in the three sampled provinces
responded differently to programme components. For example, in Samangan, the adolescent girls who were
exposed to “tailoring” through the Community-based Livelihood Training continue to engage in this activity. All
recipients of an Unconditional Cash Grant reported spending funds on education, although some mentioned
spending funds on other items. The Mini Media Clubs also had good uptake, as IP service providers in Nangahar
and Herat noted that the children share the messages discussed at the club with their families when they go back
home. The use of Safe Space facilities varied. For example, in Samangan and Nangahar, the communities in
these provinces are more traditional, and so the Safe Spaces, functioned more like venues for Reflect Circles or
awareness raising meetings. The uptake for the Safe Space in Herat, however, was remarkable. Through the
Community-based Life Skills Training, programme participants were exposed to hygiene practices, and, unlike
the other provinces, three women in Samangan opened as small shop which sells hygiene products and offers
consultations to women.
Overall, there were several factors limiting the effective delivery of programme services, and they are: (1) partner
capacity limitations; (2) government policies on Community -based Livelihood Training; and (3) insecurity.
E.3 Efficiency
To the extent possible, the ACO managed to ensure an efficient implementation of AWLI. Notwithstanding the
delays created by an IP and the Pandemic, results were achieved in a cost-efficient manner with little waste and
duplication. As noted in the limitations section, the ACO is categorized as a Non-Family Duty Station, which means
that due to security reasons, family members are not authorized to travel the office. Staff are allowed Rest and
Recuperation (R&R) travel to support a work-life balance, and so staff typically work for short periods of time (no
more than three years). Not surprisingly, findings indicate that there were three different country representatives
over five years and three different AWLI programme managers during the same period. Change in management
also implied supervision from multiple supervisors. All such dimensions ought to be considered when
designing and planning programmes in Afghanistan.
Moreover, the consultants responsible for the baseline experienced significant challenges, and subsequently,
precluded the IPs from working for almost one year, thereby prolonging the overall workplan. While UNICEF has
used a mix of strategies to implement AWLI, one of the most cost-efficient ones was during the Pandemic. The
Pandemic restricted movement and prevented participants from gathering into groups, and UNICEF sought
solutions by reprogramming and adding the fourth objective focused on the distribution of supplies. Findings show
that the procurement of recreation and hygiene kits and handwashing stations was successful, as this component
not only expended the preexisting surplus of funds, but it also exceeded the planned target. Finally, the findings
illustrate that AWLI’s monitoring systems in place were imperfect, creating confusion about the number of
programme participants reached, and the ages of adolescents specifically. A system which produces reliable
and accurate monitoring data is critical to strong programme management.
E.4 Sustainability
Data indicates that only a small number of programme activities continue to function since the official handover of
AWLI to provincial partners. However, there is interest in scaling up activities, as there are male and female
champions based within the community whose values are aligned with the AWLI’s objectives. Key factors
influencing scale up include: (1) government willingness; (2) community interest; and (3) IP capacity. Activities
82
recommended for scale up are Community Dialogues, Reflect Circles, and the Safe Space facility in Herat only.
Samangan and Herat provinces ought to be prioritized, because the communities in Nangahar province were still
very conservative. Given that the CPC will be ending in 2021, the ACO has a limited window in which to scale
up activities in the recommended provinces.
E.5 Coherence
AWLI is consistent with the Global Programme to End Child Marriage and does not duplicate national initiatives
promoting girl’s education. National initiatives designed to directly reduce child marriage in Afghanistan are
limited. It does not appear that AWLI has any contradictions, and in fact findings indicate linkages and synergies
with ongoing UNICEF programmes in other sectors (i.e., education, gender, and WASH). Since AKF and
UNICEF’s programmes are located in different geographical areas, there is little duplication in the areas of girl’s
education and empowerment. However, the Adolescent Portfolio Evaluation observed duplications within
UNICEF’s programmes, which could be remedied with a ToC for adolescent programming. This insightful
recommendation has already been included in that report. 172
E.6 Impact
Findings show that through the AWLI programme, UNICEF Afghanistan helped to improve the well-being and
education of adolescent girls, especially through the promotion of positive gender norms across the life cycle,
including the reduction of harmful practices (early marriage for adolescent girls aged 12 and older), effective
parenting (investment in girls’ education through Unconditional Cash Grant), and the promotion of girl’s education
into secondary education level.
The process which should take place for a rights holder to believe that he or she could take action when
responding to the messages about delaying marriage and extending education is critical to understanding the
adolescent model. The logic is that interpersonal communications and interpersonal relations were expected to
happen at all levels, and AWLI’s contributions would, in turn, lead to or influence attitude, traditional beliefs, and,
ultimately behaviour change.
More specifically, IF rights holders discuss and reflect on messages (delivered through trusted channels), THEN
they will be encouraged or/and motivated to adopt the new attitudes and practices and change their behaviour.
This finding assumes that the rights holders and duty bearers have had the opportunity to voice their views about
ending child marriage and promoting education for adolescent girls.
This evaluation’s findings also showed that older rights holders (males and females) have indeed taken action,
whereas younger rights holders still appear to be forming their opinions. The observed positive change of older
males and females, by taking action and calling attention to the violence against children and women, represents
a key prerequisite for a reducing early marriage and promoting girl’s education. After the rights holder’s family
received the grant, the evidence shows that the funds were spent on education-related items. However, findings
show that the rights holder’s ability to exercise choices regarding her education and family’s livelihood are not
met.
The evaluation findings have also given a glimpse into the Afghan family and community dynamics, as the impact
section have shed light on who within the family or community makes decisions about if, when, and who a girl
should marry. For example, the community level, this evaluation revealed that community and religious leaders,
who exert influence over decisions about early marriages and girl’s education, do not always use their powers to
hold community member to account despite having knowledge about child and women’s rights. Moreover, it has

83
been evidenced that an Unconditional Cash Grant helps in purchasing education-related items, but this may not
translate into an increased ability to make life choices for the adolescent rights holder.
Finally, the circumstances are now distinct that a positive unintended effect was a severe reduction of the dowery
in Samangan, yet at the family level, there may be mounting pressures when there is drug addiction or when the
matriarch was a victim of early marriage, as she may perpetuate the cycle.
F. LESSONS LEARNED & RECOMMENDATIONS
F.1 Lessons Learned
As part of fulfilling the ToR, this section includes notable lessons learned, summarizing the key take-aways
regarding AWLI’s programme implementation.

Multi-sectoral programmes help in advancing gender equality, as multiple groups (including men) become
attracted to and participated in AWLI.

Highly skilled and motivated IPs work through initial community resistance by galvanizing male and female
community champions.

Working with men (fathers and uncles) and boys (brothers and nephews) is critical, as they are also part of
social norms and harmful practices that limit women’s ability to make decisions about education, health,
livelihood resources.

The context is an important factor when developing programmes to reduce early marriage, promote girl’s
education, and support women’s empowerment. As seen the Safe Space facility in Herat could not keep up
with the demand, whereas in Samangan and Nangahar, the Safe Space was not taken up in the same fashion.

Understanding the underlying requirements for carrying out RCTs helps to minimize costly errors in the end.

It is important for UNICEF programme staff to understand the underlying requirements for carrying out different
data collection and analysis methods. Likely topics to review would include: (i) how to develop good study
questions; (ii) the data requirements; (iii) methodologies which are not conducive to certain contexts like
Afghanistan; and (iv) the competencies that the consultants or IPs must not only have to collect the
information, but also to refrain from creating false expectations within affected populations.

UNICEF evaluators ought to have a comfortable, professional session in which they may clearly communicate
to programme managers the risks and benefits of using a certain method.

Given the suspension of the Unconditional Cash Grant component in Ghor, it is paramount that upcoming
programmes have a comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation strategy.

F.2 Recommendations
In accordance with the ToR, the recommendations are presented in the order of programme design, implementation, and scale up of similar
programmes in Afghanistan. However, it should be noted that the last recommendation is time sensitive. These recommendations were developed
with UNICEF and its partners through two-rounds of debriefing stakeholder presentations.

As noted from stakeholders, there was a clear concern about promoting
continued education for both males and females. Hence, when creating
messages to promote girl’s education, also consider similar messages for
boys.

Background
Afghanistan has one of the world’s youngest and fastest growing populations, with approximately 63 percent of
the population (27.5 million Afghans) below 25 years of age and 46 percent (11.7 million children) under 15 years of
age.173 Over 25 per cent of the population are at the most important juncture of their lives, adolescence: the
transition from childhood into adulthood.
Of the nearly 29 million people in Afghanistan, adolescents (10-19-year olds) account for approximately 25 percent
of the population.174 While adolescence is a time of both opportunity and vulnerability for girls and boys,
adolescent girls are a particularly vulnerable population in Afghanistan, especially to child marriage. Moreover, poor
access to proper healthcare, basic facts for life information and life skills, nutrition, education, livelihood
opportunities as well as vulnerability to sexual abuse and other forms of violence, have long-term effects on girls’
and boys’ health and development and the wellbeing of their future children and communities.175
Child marriage is a human rights violation and is a key impediment to girls being able to reach their full potential.
Harmful cultural practices such as exchange of brides, bride price, engagement before birth, and marriage as a
method of solving community disputes contribute to child marriage. 176 Married adolescent girls suffer separation
from family and friends, decreased opportunities for education, lack of freedom to interact with peers, poor health

outcomes, and lack of livelihood opportunities. Child marriage also results in bonded labour, sexual exploitation and
intimate partner violence against adolescent brides, including sexual violence.
Girls married young are less likely to be able to give informed consent, go to school, and have access to
reproductive and sexual health care, and face restrictions of movement. It is estimated that 4 out of 10 girls are
married before 18 years of age in Afghanistan, with figures varying between those in urban and rural areas (DHS
2015). In Afghanistan, child marriage is mainly a result of harmful traditional practices, socio economic factors and
a lack of appreciation for the value of education. These determinants vary from province to province and between
rural and urban areas.
Although UNICEF advocates for marriage only from the age of 18 years, in Afghanistan, tribal social rules are still
the norm and are predominantly applied in many parts of the country. Unfortunately, this has enabled an
environment where underage marriage of children is still the norm, especially for adolescent girls. In respect to the
legal age of marriage, Afghanistan has two parallel legal systems: Article 70 of the Civil Law of the Islamic Republic
of Afghanistan denotes the legal marriage for girls as sixteen and for boys as eighteen, while under the system of
Sharia law, the age of marriage for girls is defined as the age upon which a girl reaches maturity. As a result, this
can be different ages for different girls, many of whom are adolescents. Another compounding factor to the
challenge of ending child marriage in Afghanistan is that marriage is generally not recorded under the civil
registration system, making it very difficult for any legal recourse.
Furthermore, the development and humanitarian environment for adolescent boys and girls is exacerbated by the
difficulties of living in a conflict- and emergency-affected country. Afghanistan is a complex environment, where
natural hazards and conflict negatively impact adolescents’ rights, disproportionately affecting poor communities
and eroding development gains. The dire situation for children in Afghanistan is further reflected in the Human
Development Index of 0.46, the lowest in the region, and 169th out of 182 countries globally. It is estimated that 46
per cent of women aged 15 to 49 years were first married or in union by 18 and that 15% of them were married by
age 15177.

The AWLI Programme
The Afghan Women’s Initiative in Support of Adolescent Girls (AWLI) programme was initiated in 2016 as a 5-year
intervention to enable adolescent girls to fully enjoy their childhood and adolescence free from the risk of marriage.
By engaging key actors, including adolescents and young people, the programme sought to enable adolescent girls
to experience healthier, safer, and more empowered life transitions, including on decisions about their health,
lifestyles, marriage and childbearing.
In specific terms, the programme aimed to:
1. Change perceptions on the acceptability of early and forced marriage (EFM) and mobilize communities
to delay marriage by raising awareness of adolescent girls’ rights, the laws in place to protect them, the
negative consequences of EFM, and the importance of educating girls;
2. Empower adolescent girls to make informed life choices through education, vocational and life skills
training, and peer support networks; and
3. Map and document the status of adolescent girls in Afghanistan.
The programme covered 5 provinces, namely Nangarhar, Samangan, Ghor, Herat and Farah - provinces with high
rates of child marriage practices. Four districts were prioritised in each province, for a total focus of 20 districts in 5
provinces.

Direct target groups:
 200,000 adolescent girls. Adolescent girls from 20 out of the 66 districts in five provinces were to have
opportunities to participate in training and orientation sessions and organize themselves into youth and
adolescents’ associations/clubs for various activities under the project.
 200 members of community level Shura from the 20 districts - 80,000 to 100,000 elders, parents,
community leaders and religious leaders from the 5 provinces.
 1,000 households, each with at least one out of school (OoS) adolescent girl, to receive cash grants in a
total of 8 districts in Ghor and Herat provinces.
Indirect target groups:
 875,000 adolescents in the remaining 46 districts of the five provinces and 200,000 adolescent boys in the
20 ‘project districts’ of the five provinces to benefit from information shared through public fora, media
including TV, radio, mobile technology, social media , traditional methods of information sharing, including
television spots, street theatre, youth and student forums etc. 91
 The total population of about 1.3 million including adults in the five provinces will benefit from awareness
a) Training of facilitators from among key stakeholders - including religious leaders, Maliks, teachers, youth leaders
and adolescents - on facilitation skills, community dialogue, and appreciative inquiry as well as on key issues, such
as the harmful impacts of Child Marriage and the provisions of the CRC, sharia/Islamic laws, the Afghan
constitution and laws, as well as other relevant frameworks related to ending Child Marriage;
b) Workshops and focus group discussions facilitated at the district and community level by those trained in a)
above, to determine the specific barriers and bottlenecks for preventing and ending Child Marriage and addressing
the needs of married girls in each community. This would in turn lead to consensus and collective agreement on the
strategic approach and messaging for community dialogues and orientation sessions as well as for local media.
The goal of these activities was to promote new norms around the marriage of adolescent girls and identify
mechanisms to support families in delaying marriage. Issues requiring attention at the level of provincial governor’s
office and various ministries were to be identified and form part of the key messages for policy advocacy;
c) Community dialogues at village and district level focused on the harmful effects of Child Marriage, carried out
quarterly by a group of facilitators with adolescent girls (and boys), families, Maliks, religious leaders, teachers and
youth leaders. These dialogues were intended to result in timebound action plans with clear roles and
responsibilities to be reviewed in subsequent community dialogue sessions three months later, with further
elaboration of new activities on issues aimed at preventing and ending child labour in the community;
d) Communication and information sessions both through the community dialogues at the village level and through
a wide range of public channels, including television spots, plays, leaflets, pictorial storybooks, etc.
II. Empower adolescent girls to make informed life choices through education, vocational and life skills
training, and peer support networks
This objective was to be achieved in synergy with some of the other programmes and projects already being
implemented by the provincial departments of Education and Public Health with UNICEF assistance. The specific
intervention that was already being implemented and would have a bearing on this objective was the education of
adolescents and out of schoolgirls through Accelerated Learning Centres (ALCs) and primary schools.
The interventions under this objective were aimed at empowering girls with the knowledge and skills to understand
themselves, their surroundings, their allies in postponing marriage and thus reduce child marriage. It was also
aimed at addressing the needs and challenges faced by adolescent girls who were already married. Cash grants
were to be given to adolescent girls and families to help girls attend and complete secondary school, or to complete
primary education for those who had not yet done so. However, in villages without schools, most girls have never
received any formal education. To address this problem, with assistance from bilateral donors including USAID,
UNICEF provided support to the Ministry of Education to open ALCs in priority provinces aimed at providing
education from grades 1 to 6 within three years. In addition, support was provided for meetings and networks of
adolescent girls to help them gain knowledge and skills; build their agency, confidence, and self-esteem; and
increase their capacity to access services and seek support to postpone marriage or to cope with its
consequences.
The specific planned interventions under this objective, complementary to the existing efforts detailed above,
included:
92
The key strategies for the AWLI programme included:
Community engagement and mobilization
This was a key strategy to achieve the result of empowerment of adolescents. It involved engagement and
mobilization of key stakeholders such as religious and other influential leaders (for example Maliks), parents and
the community at large. Community discussions were held to raise awareness on harmful traditional practices and
develop action plans to prevent and address them at community level including plans to ensure that all school-age
children are in formal schools/ accelerated learning centres, there are no marriages before age 18, adolescents are
supported to access services for their protection and empowerment, and so on.
Building on existing structures
The programme implementation was done through existing mechanisms such as Accelerated Learnings Centres
(ALCs), School Management Shuras (SMSs), Child Protection Action Network (CPAN) which is a forum mandated
by the Ministry of Labour Social Affairs, Martyrs and Disabled (MOLSAMD) to respond to reported cases of child
abuse, Community Development Committees (CDCs) etc. as much as possible. The partner CSO/s mapped the
existing structures in the programme implementation areas and identified the most appropriate channels for
delivery of programme interventions (which may vary depending on context and capacity).
Strong coordination with government agencies and other partners
Since the programme intended to capitalize on existing structures, regular coordination meetings at national,
provincial and district levels were to be held for integrated programme implementation. It was critical to liaise with
Ministry of Education (MoE), Provincial Education Directorates (PEDs) and District Education Departments (DEDs)
along with government agencies related to child protection, health and nutrition in this process.
AWLI Programme Monitoring and Evaluation
The task of monitoring implementation of the AWLI programme was assumed by ActionAid International, the
programme implementing partner consortium lead. ActionAid developed a monitoring framework that specified the
key indicators to be tracked, data collection methods and frequency of data collection. The evaluation consultants
were assigned the responsibility of analyzing the monitoring data and submitting periodic reports to submit
monitoring reports to UNICEF.
Additionally, the evaluation consultants conducted a baseline assessment to establish benchmarks that would be
utilized as a basis for generating rigorous evidence on the performance of the programme at the endline stage. The
evaluation was initially intended to include both an impact evaluation (using Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)
approach) of the cash transfer intervention in Ghor and Herat provinces and a summative evaluation of the social
mobilization activities in all 5 programme provinces, but due to the inability to obtain a large enough sample of valid
beneficiary households at the baseline stage, the RCT component was dropped and the endline evaluation will only
cover the summative component.
93
Summative Evaluation Purpose
The purpose of the summative evaluation is to contribute to evidence-based and risk-informed programming on
increasing access of out-of-school (OoS) adolescent girls to secondary education and changing societal
perceptions on child marriage practices and girls’ empowerment in Afghanistan.
The main audience for the evaluation will be the Government of Afghanistan, the U.S. Department of State –
Secretary’s Office of Global Women’s Issues (S/GWI), UNICEF, programme implementing partners, programme
recipient groups and other stakeholders. By rigorously measuring and demonstrating the results of the AWLI
project, UNICEF would like to gather evidence to facilitate learning based on the results of the programme, provide
accountability to key stakeholders, and inform the design and implementation of future projects/programmes
targeted at adolescents.
In regard to learning, the evaluation results are expected to deliver evidence on the relationship between financial
incentives, education, and perceptions on child marriage/girls’ empowerment. Considering limited evidence on the
relationship between school attendance and changing perceptions on child marriage globally, these results are also
expected to add value to the global movements to ending child marriage and increasing education of adolescent
girls. Lessons learned and recommendations from the evaluation will also be used in developing the programme
approach for other provinces and advocacy in support of Out of School (OoS) adolescent girls in Afghanistan.
Summative Evaluation Objectives
The evaluation’s objectives are to:
 Measure the relevance, effectiveness, cohesion, efficiency, sustainability and impact of the AWLI programme in
regard to increasing school enrolment of adolescent girls and stimulating social behaviour change related to
perceptions of child marriage and girls’ empowerment.
 Identify gaps in the programme results chain/ToC, lessons learned, and provide recommendations on how to
design, implement and scale up similar programmes in the rest of Afghanistan.
Evaluation scope
The summative evaluation will cover both the social mobilization component of the programme in all 20 districts in
the 5 provinces, plus the cash grant intervention in Herat. The cash grant intervention was initially meant to be
implemented in both Ghor and Herat but was dropped in Ghor due to adverse implementation conditions. The
evaluation will attempt to assess the extent to which the combination of both cash grants and social mobilization
activities increased school enrolment among out of school adolescent girls in comparison to social mobilization
activities alone.
The evaluation methodology should be based on mixed methods, participatory, gender, equity and human rights-
based approaches. The evaluation will take an integrated approach by assessing the experiences of adolescent
girls facing different types of discrimination and exclusion related to economic, ethnic, religious, physical and
94
intellectual impairments. It is imperative for the evaluation to identify opportunities to contribute to ensuring that
future programme interventions will address equity, gender and human rights related issues.
Sampling Frame
The sampling frame for this study will be based on actual programme reach with regard to the target groups
outlined earlier. The table below indicates the actual reach of the programme based on these benchmarks.

Evaluation Questions
96
The chosen evaluation criteria for the summative evaluation are relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact and
sustainability. The key evaluation questions listed below aren’t exhaustive and will be refined further during the
inception phase in collaboration with the evaluation team.
Relevance: Assessment of alignment of the AWLI interventions to the local context as well as national strategies
and policies of Afghanistan and UNICEF, especially among the most deprived sections of the population, including
validating existing adolescent programming ToC:
To what extent does the programme design and implementation fit the local context, including the conflict context,
and what measures were taken to adapt to changes in the context?
Is the programme aligned with the national strategies and policies of Afghanistan and the UNICEF Global Strategic
Plan 2018-2021?
To what extent does the programme address and meet the needs of adolescent girls and their families, especially
those that are OoS?
Effectiveness: The extent to which the programmes intended results were achieved at the output level:
To what extent did UNICEF deliver on its intended outputs?
What were the major factors influencing the successful delivery of outputs?
To what extent were the programme interventions taken up by target programme beneficiaries?
Which factors impeded programme delivery and take-up and how could these have been overcome?
Did the programme effectively manage conflict-related risks?
Efficiency: The extent to which the programme’s outputs were delivered in a timely and cost-efficient manner:
Were the programme outputs achieved according to the work plan and timeline?
Were the programme outputs achieved according to the budget and cost-efficiently?
What were the major factors influencing the efficient delivery of outputs?
Sustainability: the extent to which the AWLI interventions can be scaled up, and the capacity of Government
partners to assume the responsibility of carrying these initiatives forward:
What strategies and interventions of the programme are most likely to be scaled up or sustained after the
implementation of the programme?
What would facilitate or impede the scale-up of the AWLI intervention?
Have beneficiaries indicated any interest in seeing the programme scaled?
Coherence: The extent to which other interventions with similar objectives complement or contradict the
programme and vice versa.
How compatible was the AWLI programme with other interventions aimed at:
97
achieving girl’s empowerment?
increasing school attendance?
reducing child marriage?
Please include internationally-led, nationally-led, and local grassroots interventions. What synergies, linkages,
contradictions, duplications, exist?
Impact: The extent to which the project has increased secondary school enrolment of out of school adolescent girls
and changed social behaviours and attitudes towards child marriage:
 What difference has the project made in changing perceptions of the target groups on child marriage?
Have they delayed marriage by raising awareness on the rights of adolescent girls to education, or for
other reasons?
 Has the project made a difference in adolescent girls’ lives by increasing their ability to make life
choices?
 How successful has the combination of social mobilization activities and cash transfers been on
increasing secondary enrolment rates of adolescent girls and changing social behaviour towards child
marriage vis-à-vis social mobilization interventions alone?
 What were the effects, intended or unintended, that the programme had on sources of tension and
sources of cohesion in the 20 districts where it worked, and how were these monitored over time?
Methodology
The utilization of a mixed methods approach, making use of both quantitative and qualitative data through a variety
of methods such as household surveys, key informant interviews, and participatory methods, as well as routine
monitoring and baseline data are recommended for this assignment. Triangulation of data sources and collection
methods is important for verifying evidence along the programme results chain.
A rigorous evaluation design appropriate to the objectives of this evaluation and well suited to providing valid
answers to the key evaluation questions should be proposed. Non-experimental quantitative techniques should be
considered for the cash grant component of the programme, while qualitative methods will be a better option for the
social mobilization component. Some considerations in this regard would include the theory of change (ToC)
approach as a way of understanding how the programme planned to achieve change by mapping out links between
processes and results at the outcome and impact levels. Evidence should be looked at in relation to key
assumptions about how change would happen and in relation to other key influencers on change, including factors
external to the programme.
In order to provide evidence of causality, given the existence of other interventions operating in the same time and
space, approaches associated with contribution analysis may also be considered given the methodological
challenges inherent in proving attribution. This would involve adding a further stage to the theory of change
methodology, allowing existing evidence to be substantiated or challenged, and eliminating other possible causes
for the results achieved.
98
Evaluability and Limitations
The project interventions should be evaluable based on comparisons with data on key programme indicators
generated through the baseline assessment. Access to respondents and data collection sites will depend on
challenges pertaining to security and accessibility, keeping in mind Do No Harm principles and the restrictions
imposed by the Covid-19 pandemic. Other equally important issues that should be considered in preparation for
data collection include sensitive ethnic, religious, cultural and tribal norms of the target populations. The evaluation
team will be responsible for verification of the baseline, end-line and monitoring data, as well as developing risk
mitigation measures prior to commencing the field work activities.
A tentative Theory of Change (ToC) encompassing the whole portfolio of adolescent-focused programming has
been developed through a related exercise, therefore the evaluation team will endeavour to underpin the evaluation
within this framework and further develop it where gaps exist.
Evaluation Management
The evaluation will be managed by the Research & Evaluation Specialist under the supervision of the Chief of
Social Policy, Evaluation & Research (SPEAR) Section, and under the overall oversight and guidance of the
Representative of the UNICEF Afghanistan Country Office. The SPEAR Section will lead the evaluation process,
put in place a quality assurance system, provide administrative and substantive backstopping support, and ensure
appropriate liaison with the focal points for the evaluation both within UNICEF and with external stakeholders. It will
also ensure that the evaluation is conducted in accordance with the Code of Conduct for Evaluation in the UN
System, as approved by the members of the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) standards.
To assure quality, an Evaluation Reference Group (ERG) will be constituted and include 6-8 UNICEF staff
members, representatives from the Government and donors who will review evaluation deliverables and provide
comments regularly on the evaluation’s scope, methodology, findings, conclusions and recommendations.
Profiles of the Evaluators: An international consultant will be chosen to partner with UNICEF in conducting this
evaluation. The individual will have extensive experience relevant to the evaluation of adolescent programmes and
will, in collaboration with a national data collection partner firm, ensure the quality of the evaluation process,
outputs, methodology, and timely delivery of all products.
Ethical Review
Evaluation methods and data collection tools involving children and sensitive topics must be approved by an
external Institutional review Board (IRB) in Afghanistan. The evaluation team with the support of UNICEF ACO
SPEAR Section will submit the final version of the inception report and data collection tools to an external IRB for
approval before commencing fieldwork.
99
Evaluators are required to identify and consider any potential ethical issues and must disclose in writing any past
experiences or relationships, including of their families and friends, to the object of the evaluation. Evaluators must
exercise independent judgement and resist undue influence from any party, including:
1. Be partial and produce a comprehensive presentation strengths and weaknesses of the policy, programme
and take due account of the view of stakeholders based on unbiased findings;
2. Illustrate evidence on verified findings and lessons learned;
3. Exercise honesty, integrity and respect for dignity and diversity;
4. Produce evaluation reports based on fair representation of knowledge, vulnerable groups, gender and
ethnic groups.
Evaluators are required to receive consent from participants before involving them in the data collection process
and respect their right to provide information in confidence. Evaluators must inform participants about the scope
and limits of confidentiality and ensure that all information provided remains confidential. It is mandatory to prepare
risk management plans to minimalize potential harm to participants before starting the fieldwork.
Dissemination and advocacy of evaluation findings

G.4 ANNEX 4: Communities & Individuals Selection Criteria
The selection criteria for the three provinces was:
1) Regional representation. One province in all three regions was selected. There was one province
located in the North (i.e., Samangan) and one in the East (i.e., Nangahar). However, there were
three provinces located in the Western Region (i.e., Herat, Farah, Ghor). Herat was prioritized,
however, as it was the only province with the unconditional grant component;
2) Population density: The province’s population is an important element which directly influences the
extent to which community engagement and social and behaviour change (SBC) interventions are
effective. The two selected provinces in the East and North are primarily rural. Therefore, Herat was
selected, because compared to the other two provinces in the Western Region (Farah and Ghor), it
has the highest population density;178 and
3) All provinces must be safe for the data collection teams.
The major sampling characteristics used to identify the three districts within Herat, Nangahar, and
Samangan were:
1) Natural Disasters: Presence of critical risk factors which reflect exceptional hardships such as the
prevalence of natural disasters (e.g., drought and floods) which would exacerbate poverty conditions.
This would, in turn, put pressures on families to resort to engaging in negative coping mechanisms,
such as early marriage;
2) Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs): Communities which have IDPs provide a different context in
which the programme works;
3) Favourable (or Lack of) Economic Conditions: This situation would influence the extent to which
families may support themselves. For example, in Samangan province’s district of Roi-do-ab, there is
the coalmine industry which could help to alleviate poverty conditions;
4) Peri-Urban versus Isolated Areas: Communities residing in these two different areas would
influence the extent to which families are aware of the perils of early marriage as well as the degree
to which they resort to early marriage.
5) Security situation. All communities to be visited must be safe for travel for the data collection
teams; and
6) Respondents in each selected province and district are not only familiar with the programme activities
but may have experienced more than one component of the programme.
The process of sampling at the sub-district levels included the following steps:
1) QARA, with the assistance of the IP, conducted a review of all of the available “villages” or
communities where the programme was implemented;
2) The team sampled individuals from all three out of four available communities to ensure
representativeness, while meeting the sampling criteria of individuals having participated in at least
two different programme activities. After it was discovered that not too many programme participants
had experienced at least two programme activities, the team began to focus on those who had been
exposed to the community-based livelihoods training, mini media club, been a recipient of an
unconditional cash grant, and visited the safe spaces.
3) In Herat, many participants invited for an interview met the team at the community center, but in
Samangan, the team went house to house. In Nangahar, the team undertook a combination of both
methods to interview programme participants.
178 Ghor is very rural, as it is the 27th most urbanized province in Afghanistan. Similarly, Farah, ranking as the 18th most urbanized province, has few urban dwellers.
In contrast, Herat, ranks as the second most populated province in Afghanistan behind Kabul Province. Source: National Statistics and Information Authority,

Explanation where and how the above codes were applied. Subcodes (or child codes) are second-order tags assigned after a primary code to
detail or enrich the entry. The method is appropriate for virtually all qualitative studies, but particularly for ethnographies and content analyses,
studies with multiple participants and sites, and studies with a wide variety of data forms. Sub-coding is also appropriate when general code
entries will later require more extensive indexing, categorizing, and subcategorizing into hierarchies or taxonomies, or for nuanced qualitative data
analysis. (page 13)

Q2: EFFECTIVENESS
Q 2.1 To what extent did UNICEF deliver on its intended outputs? This coding method uses gerunds (“-ing” words) exclusively to connote
observable and conceptual action in the data. Processes also imply
actions intertwined with the dynamics of time, such as things that emerge,
change, occur in particular sequences, or become strategically
implemented. Process coding is appropriate for virtually all qualitative
studies, but particularly for grounded theory research that extracts
participant action/interaction and consequences. 180The following child

Q6 IMPACT
Q6 The extent to which the project has increased secondary school Coding will cover affective methods that tap into the more subjective
enrolment of out of school adolescent girls and changed social experiences we encounter with our participants: (1) Emotion, (2) Values,
behaviours and attitudes towards child marriage. and (3) action coding coding.(Ibid., page 7)
Emotion Coding: Perhaps obviously, this method labels the emotions
recalled and/or experienced by the participant or inferred by the
researcher about the participant. Emotion coding is particularly
appropriate for studies that explore intrapersonal and interpersonal
participant experiences and actions. It also provides insight into the
participants’ perspectives, worldviews, and life conditions. Note that a
141
EVALUATION CRITIA AND KEY EVALUATION QUESTIONS AND
QUALITATIVE CODING USED TO ANSWER QUESTIONS
SUBQUESTIONS
participant himself or herself may sometimes label the emotion, and thus,
it should be In Vivo coded in quotation marks.
Value Coding: is the application of three different types of related codes
onto qualitative data that reflect a participant’s values, attitudes, and
beliefs, representing his or her perspectives or worldview. A value (V:) is
the importance we attribute to ourselves, another person, thing, or idea.
An attitude (A:) is the way we think and feel about oneself, another
person, thing, or idea. A belief (B:) is part of a system that includes values
and attitudes, plus personal knowledge, experiences, opinions,
prejudices, morals, and other interpretive perceptions of the social world.
Values coding is appropriate for studies that explore cultural values,
identity, intrapersonal and interpersonal participant experiences and
actions in case studies, appreciative inquiry, oral history, and critical
ethnography.
Action Coding: is the application of an activity or action that the
participant describes once he or she had learned their new skill(s) from
the programme.
Q 6.1 What difference has the project made in changing perceptions of ACTION_EARLY MARRIAGE
the target groups on child marriage? Have they delayed marriage by ACTION _EARLY MARRIAGE
raising awareness on the rights of adolescent girls to education, or for
other reasons?
Q 6.2 Has the project made a difference in adolescent girls’ lives by ACTION_EARLY MARRIAGE
increasing their ability to make life choices? ACTION _EARLY MARRIAGE
Q 6.3 How successful has the combination of social mobilization Not able to answer
activities and cash transfers been on increasing secondary enrolment
rates of adolescent girls and changing social behaviour towards child
marriage vis-à-vis social mobilization interventions alone?
Q 6.4 How has raising awareness on the harmful effects of child ACTION_EARLY MARRIAGE
marriage contributed to adolescent girls being able to attend school ACTION _EARLY MARRIAGE
and subsequently enhanced their chances of delaying marriage?
Q 6.5 What were the effects, intended or unintended, that the Sub-codes: examples of continuing schooling and delaying marriage
programme had on sources of tension and sources of cohesion in the [tensions reduced in house] and [tensions reduced in community]
20 districts where it worked, and how were these monitored over time?
N.B 1. While the evaluation may not be able to comprehensively This method extracts attributions or causal beliefs from participant data
answer this overarching Q6, due to limited data, nuanced self- about not just how but why particular outcomes came about. The analyst
reported insights about perceived changes (in the family and the searches for combinations of antecedent and mediating variables that

community) will be gathered through the use of qualitative lead toward certain pathways and attempts to map a three-part process
methods. Specifically, the KIIs will generate specific examples of as a CODE 1 > CODE 2 > CODE 3 sequence. Causation coding is
how the programme has changed perceptions about early appropriate for discerning motives, belief systems, worldviews,
marriage and the importance of continuing girl’s education.182 processes, recent histories, interrelationships, and the complexity of
influences and effects on human actions and phenomena.
This method may serve grounded theorists in searches for causes,
conditions, contexts, and consequences. It is also appropriate for
evaluating the efficacy of a particular program or as preparatory work
before diagramming or modeling a process through visual means such as
decision modeling and causation networks. (Ibid, page 12)
N.B 2. There is a lack of evidence that can prove that the number
of marriages have been delayed or reduced [Q6.4] and that there
have been relative increases in the number of adolescent girls
attending secondary school [Q6.3].
182 These examples will not be representative of the entire programme. Also note that adolescents are not as articulate compared to adults, and so their “stories” may not be very detailed. Finally, given the sensitivity of the
topic, some interviewees may not be willing to discuss private matters; Many do not even discuss such issues with their parents or guardians much less with a researcher who is not known to them. As noted in the limitations
section, given the need for informed consent, some interviewee responses may not be very explicit or elaborate.

G.12 ANNEX 12: Description of Ethical Safeguards
QARA was commissioned to provide data collection support for AWLI Summative Evaluation across three
provinces, Herat, Nangarhar and Samangan.
This annex outlines how the data collection process was completed, including references to (i) respect
for dignity and diversity, (ii) fair representation [accuracy], (iii) compliance with codes for vulnerable
groups, although this was not necessary), and (iv) confidentiality, and (v) avoidance of harm.
The right to self-determination or ensuring that evaluation participants may proactively contribute to the
evaluation, was not fulfilled due to limited time.183
(1) PREPARING FOR DATA COLLECTION
Field Researchers Training
Data collection training happened in three phases. The first training was carried out by the Team Leader virtually
to the QARA core research team. In two virtual sessions the Team Leader trained the core research team on
the overall scope of the AWLI program and the main objective of the summative evaluation. The second training
was led by the QARA core research team with all the team members to make sure they have fully grasped the
purpose of the evaluation and are comfortable with the evaluation tools. The third training was a refresher
training that happened at the provinces before the start of the data collection.
Training Core Research Team
Team Leader delivered two training sessions using a remote platform. The first session included the introduction
of the AWLI program. In this session ,the QARA core research team was introduced to the Team Lead, Dr.
Nichols and vice versa. Through this virtual training, the Team Lead provided an overview of AWLI program
design, theory of change, program activities, and ethical procedures for data collection, storage, and
transmission.
The second session included a discussion on qualitative research methods and AWLI research instruments.
This training, also led by the Team Leader on 4th April 2021, included the core research team, field team,
translators and transcribers. The training was started with overview of the qualitative research methods,
purposeful sampling method, and various strategies and practices of conducting qualitative field interviews. The
process of conducting the interview included setting up the interview, where the interviewer explains the
purpose of the interview, obtaining consent form and moving on with assuring confidentiality. And most
importantly making sure the interviewer feels comfortable throughout the interview. The training ended with
questions and answers on the research instruments and feedback was given on the mock interviews.
Training Field Researchers
This training was for field researchers via zoom call. The training content included an overview of AWLI program
activities and research instruments in local languages Dari and Pashto. The core team made sure field
researchers fully understand the ethical procedures, confidentiality, anonymity, and informed consent. The team
also focused on the different strategies used in the field to conduct a qualitative interview. The process of
conducting the interview was explained at greater length. For example, in order to make the interviewee feel
comfortable to share her experiences without any concern, the interviewer should follow a structured process

public health (p. 321–350). American Psychological Association. https://doi.org/10.1037/10388-016
147
that includes setting up the interview, being polite and silent when the participant tells her story and keep on
debriefing whenever required. The training ended with questions and answers about the AWLI program
activities, research instruments, and techniques for conducting the interview in the field.
Field Refresher Training
The core research team arranged a refresher training in each province prior to the start of the field work. Our
previous experience suggests that having a refresher training increases the quality of the data collection and
reduces technical errors.
The refresher training covered the overall program activities, the purpose and the implementation process. But
the focus is more on ensuring researchers are comfortable with the instruments and can create a friendlier
environment in which the interviewees feel comfortable to share their stories and talk about sensitive issues.
The core team emphasized the importance of obtaining consent from the research participants and
confidentiality of the data. Voluntary participation of beneficiaries was reiterated to the researchers and specific
instructions were provided to the researchers. The session was concluded with a few mock interviews.
(2) DATA COLLECTION
Selection of Research Participants
The Team Leader provided QARA with the sample framework that outlined the number of KIIs and FGDs in the
sample districts. In addition to the breakdown of participants at the district level, and the requirement for KIIs
was that participants were supposed to have been engaged with in at least two different activities.
In support of face validity, QARA was accompanied by the IP staff to identify the beneficiaries.
Ethical Considerations
QARA followed strict ethical procedures during field work. Each researcher had been through multiple rounds
of ethics training during their work at QARA. Confidentiality of the data, anonymity, and voluntary participation
of the research participants and how to handle sensitive information are part of the training content. And before
each field work, the researchers were provided with a refresher training on the importance of ethical procedures.
Voice recorded interviews were transferred via OneDrive password protected drives. The confidentiality of the
voices was explained with the transcribers’ team before sharing the audios to them. All the audio recorded
interviews to be deleted after the transcriptions are quality checked.

Audio files of interviews were shared by the field team with QARA HQ via our online platform, and our quality
control team began working immediately upon receipt of the first files, in order to expedite the process to the
greatest extent possible. Transcription team lead supervisor reviewed the audio interviews for any missing,
inconsistent, or irrelevant information, incorrectly articulated questions, topics avoided by the respondents, and
other potential problems. This QC review provided the supervisor with an opportunity to remove from the study
interviews that were judged to be potentially inaccurate. The supervisor shared their observations with the field
teams as a QA measure to improve the quality of collection when possible.
Transcription: After the audio interviews were certified to be accurate by the QC, they were shared with the
transcription team. Transcribed interviews were reviewed by the supervisor, who checked them for any missing
or inaccurate information, or inconsistencies with the audio files. Additionally, the QC paid special attention to
vernacular used by the respondents in rural areas that required clarification. Once approved, transcriptions
were passed on to the translation team. For instance, we had to bring a native Herati on board to transcribe the
interviews in Herat to make sure that transcription does not omit anything because of the differences in the
dialect.
148
Field researchers are part of the quality assurance team who have validated the transcribed interviews. The
translation team did not start translation unless the content of the audio is validated by the researchers who
have completed the interview. Upon their arrival back to the office from fieldwork, the researchers reviewed the
transcribed material to make sure data is accurately transcribed. This process took several days but it is an
added layer to ensure quality control and content accuracy.
Translation: After the transcribed interviews were verified by the researchers, the translation team began their
work. All translation team members have extensive experience translating research interviews. The team took
context and cultural nuance into account, both of which are essential to producing quality work. We often
randomly select 10 percent of the translated interviews and match the English content with the transcription.
However, on this assignment we have checked every single file with the original scripts and in some cases with
the audio file. We focused a lot on the quality of the translated files since the Team Leader will be using the
translated files for the further analysis. We purposefully included the translators in all of the team members
training that was led by the Team Leader, and so they were familiarized with terminology and the vernacular of
this project.
(3) QUALITY ASSURANCE MECHANISMS TO ENHANCE DATA CREDIBILITY
QARA developed a Field Quality Assurance Plan to closely monitor AWLI data collection process step by step,
including researcher training, data gathering, data transfer, transcriptions, translations, and post-fieldwork
debriefing.
Training to Gather High Quality Data
Since the researchers are key instruments in qualitative research, the first step of assuring quality was to train
researchers to equip them with resources needed to successfully carry out the field work. To assess their skills
of conducting good interviews, field researchers were required to role play in the mock interviews. Moreover,
the researchers are trained on how to handle incidents that interrupt the normal interview process and how to
ensure a smooth continuation of an interview if interviewees lost interest.
Data Transfer, Transcription, and Translation
Transfer of the data to HQ from the field was seamless, using password protected files. Finally, during the
transcription of interviews, QARA ensured that the data file reflected a 100 percent match in content compared
to the audio files. This ensured that the transcriptions were verbatim. A similar practice was applied to the
translation process.
Post-Fieldwork Debriefing
Upon the completion of fieldwork, all team leads and team members able to travel to Kabul returned to QARA
headquarters for debriefing. In accordance with best practices developed over years of conducting evaluations,
the team shared stories and observations from the field, to provide contextual insight into the main challenges.
This post-fieldwork debriefing session proved to be one of the most important steps in the research process.
An understanding emerged regarding why interviewees in different communities may have responded
differently to the same questions, and why certain respondents adopted a particularly positive or critical tone.

G.14 ANNEX 14: Descriptions of Programme Processes
The following activities (and their frequency) were undertaken by the Implementing Partner (IP).
1. Community Dialogues: Frequency: Quarterly & monthly meetings (1.5 hours)
2. Reflect Circles; Frequency: Monthly meetings (1.5 hours)
3. Safe Spaces: Frequency: Ongoing
4. Community-based Life Skills Training: Frequency: Monthly
5. Mini Media Clubs: Frequency: Ongoing during the school year
6. Unconditional Cash Grant: Frequency: One-off occurrence
7. Livelihood Activities: Frequency: Ongoing only in Samangan
Prior to implementation, the IP’s first activity undertaken was a focus group discussion (FGDs) held in each
district, where the programme objectives were introduced through community engagement activities. It was
during this time that the IP selected the villages which were most receptive to the AWLI’s programme
objectives. Each activity is briefly described below.
1. Community Dialogues
These activities took place every three months, and messages focused on education, literacy, child and early
marriage, gender equality, and child rights. These messages were developed based on guidelines in Dari
Language, which perceived as clear and useful.
2. Reflect Circles
During this activity, the community was able to discuss the problems of that community. The topics covered
were early marriage and promoting girls’ education. Ten males and 10 females were “recruited” to take part in
this activity. Their selection was based on the following criterion: These individuals:
 Were influential in the village;
 Literate;
 Could connect easily with others, through interpersonal communication; and
 Could share their views without hesitation (outspoken).
In the case of WASSA, the facilitators reported the need to develop an “entry exam” to confirm whether the
person selected for this role had the basic level of literacy.
The Reflect Circle was facilitated by two persons (facilitators), and the exercise focused on discussing
problems of that village; A Problem Tree and Solutions Tree would emerge from this exercise. These issues
were then carried forward to the district level all the way up to the provincial level (if pursued). There was a
female and male Shurah (council), which is an informal network, who would carry these issues forward.
The other NGOs within the consortium reported a slightly different outreach, but the modality is practically the
same. For example, there were only 10-12 people participating in this activity. Moreover, stakeholder
interview data indicates that topics were raised, discussed, followed by how to resolve this issue (e.g., early
marriage, limited access to education, limited decision making in community). There is limited evidence about
how issues were carried further to the sub-district and even to the provincial level.
3. Mini Media clubs
This is an activity open to all the students attending the formal school. Typically, students exchange their
views, test their voices with the microphones, and develop confidence to speak in public. The facilitator
transmits the following messages:
 How to manage conflicts in the home, and at the club, and they could share and discuss how to
resolve issues; and
153
 If there are fights with mom and sister in laws, resulting in the inability to concentrate in school and or
mental health issues, then they should seek help from the facilitator.
4. Safe Spaces
Stakeholder interviews indicate that at these locations, there are laptops and mobile phones provided for the
girls to use when they come and visit. These facilities were open during the day. Inside these facilities, a
Social Counsellor conducts sessions with girls in the morning and afternoons. In Herat, morning sessions
were in a group with roughly 10-20 adolescent girls, and discussions focused on depression, anger issues,
pregnancy, and early marriage. Sessions followed a question-and-answer format. In the afternoons, the
Social Counsellor engages with adolescents on a one-on-one basis in sessions that range between 10 to 30
minutes. The issues discussed are:
 Sexual and reproductive health
 Child marriage
 Abuse
 Gender-based violence and victims of early marriage
 Psychosomatic [psychological] issues
5. Community-based Life Skills Training
This activity was for only for females. This activity focused on life skills, namely (1) conflict resolution; (2) how
to spend money on basic needs; and (3) sanitation and hygiene. Training took place in the same communities
as where the Community Dialogues and Reflect Circles took place.
6. Unconditional Cash Grants
There were 472 households with adolescent girls (10-15 years old) which received an unconditional cash
grant of 19,500 AFN (USD 255) to support adolescent girl’s education. These households came from four
districts – Herat, Injil, Zinda Jan and Karukh where the AWLI project is being implemented. Prior to the cash
disbursement, the IP in Herat, WASSA, had organized various sessions with the communities including local
government representatives, and clearly communicated that the cash transfer was specifically for education
purposes, targeting families with adolescent girls only. The financial service provider (FSP) Afghan Besim
Mobile Money Company (ABMMC) was contracted to distribute cash directly to the beneficiaries, based on
payment lists provided by WASSA and approved by UNICEF. The Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM)
sampled 230 out of 472 families.
7. Community-based Livelihood Training
This activity cancelled in all provinces except for Samangan. The government’s (Ministry of Labour)
requirement was for six months, and the curriculum was only for four months. There were over multiple
vocational activities designed to lead to occupations planned. Some included:
 Tailoring;
 Hand Embroidery;
 Dairy Processing;
 Food Processing; and
 Gardening (Strawberries) from Cultivation to Processing.
In addition to the seven programme components, there was a fourth objective of providing key supplies to
adolescent girls affected by COVID-19. Therefore, the provision of supplementary hygiene materials and
recreation kits to adolescent girls and boys in both formal schools and CBEs was intended to prepare
adolescent girls to return to schools/Community Based Education (CBEs). Below are the contents of these
kits.
