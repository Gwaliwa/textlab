EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
Violence against children (VAC) has taken on a new dimension through the various types of online abuse.
Covid-19 restrictions and developments such as online teaching highlighted the balance between internet
access and protection of children. The Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children was launched
by the UN Secretary-General in 2016 with the purpose of accelerating the end to violence against children.
There are over 360 partners globally, including civil society organizations, governments, foundations,
corporations, academic institutions, faith communities, and UN agencies. The End Violence Fund has
invested $32 million in 37 projects for preventing and eliminating online child sexual exploitation and abuse.
African country partners include South Africa, Namibia, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Madagascar,
and Ghana.
The UNICEF Global Partnership programme in South Africa aims to reduce high levels of VAC in the
country and strengthen child protection from online violence through the safe use of the internet. The
initiative began in May 2018 when UNICEF implemented the programme in partnership with key
government departments including the Department of Social Development (DSD) and Department of Basic
Education (DBE). The programme sought to:
• understand the extent of the problem and the gaps in policy and implementation;
• undertake a consultative, participatory and cross-sectoral process to build commitment and ownership
in addressing the issue;
• identify appropriate prevention and response actions that could be integrated into relevant legislation,
policy, and capacity-building efforts for service providers; and,
• engage with industry to implement online safety standards and complement this with practical, tested
interventions to build knowledge and skills of children, caregivers, teachers and communities on online
safety.
As this programme was essentially a system programme it did not exclusively work with children (rights-
holders) as the ultimate beneficiaries but focused on capacitating the duty-bearers (those who interact with
children, provide services to them, develop legislation, and enforce the law). The four main pillars or
subsystems of the programme included:
1) Children, families, and communities protect children from online violence and help access services
when needed
2) Children benefit from key services that help children stay safe online and respond to the needs of
child survivors
3) Information and Communication Technology (ICT) industry implements standards and measures
to prevent and address online violence
4) National authorities and civil society have increased their knowledge of online safety and their
commitment to addressing it
EVALUATION OBJECTIVES
This is a summative evaluation of the Global End Violence Fund Programme of the United Nations
Children’s Fund (UNICEF) in South Africa. The purpose of this evaluation is to assess the aspects of
relevance, coherence, efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability and understand progress toward outputs
and outcomes (see Annex I). Considering these criteria, and describing progress towards output and
outcome results, only provides a limited picture of the true value of the programme in system transformation.
Therefore, the evaluation also focused on providing a description and assessment of the system structure
9
and dynamics and guides on how to leverage points and processes in the system where children can be
engaged more effectively. The impact on the ultimate target beneficiaries (children) was not expected at
this time and so the programme focused on system transformation and programme structure rather than
longer-term results. As a result, children were not included as respondents. The South African and global
UNICEF Child Protection units, the Evaluation Reference Group (see Annex II), and the Global Partnership
to End Violence will use the findings primarily for reflective purposes (see Annex III).
Evaluation methodology
A conceptual model of the system structure and programme interventions using a theory of change was
constructed and used to guide the tracking of results. Integrating traditional evaluation standards
(relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability, and reporting on progress) with system
evaluation criteria (including system structure, boundaries, dynamic, interrelatedness, and leverage points)
ensured that the evaluation could capture and report on both dimensions.
The study is a summative, external evaluation. It is descriptive and based on mostly qualitative data. The
evaluation methods included desk reviews (of programme documents and wider literature), KII, online
surveys, and secondary data. All ethical principles were applied both during engagements with respondents
(held remotely due to Covid-19 precautions) and the data management.
The biggest challenge was the gap in programme monitoring data and recommendations regarding the
development and implementation of a formal monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system are made. An
additional challenge included the need for repeat invitations for some parties. Although it was not necessary
or feasible to include children as participants in this evaluation, this will be critical in the future to ensure
their engagement when the system is functional and reaching children.
Key conclusions on findings
The main systemic conclusion of the evaluation is that the foundation for the system to function was
established, including system-wide awareness of COS and the generation of essential knowledge and
training materials. The overall commitment of the stakeholders was raised (except for SAPS, justice, and
the ICT industry) and the shift from awareness to practical skills and behaviour change is not yet evident.
Progress towards output and outcome results
The output results generally exceeded the targets for the programme, although the reported reach of more
than 1.2 million children needs clarification and disaggregation to reflect on the groups reached and the
most effective methods used. Peer-to-peer dialogue, the most effective strategy, needs more definition and
rollout. Training of Trainers for interventions with parents and caregivers, as well as the incorporation of
modules in existing parenting programmes, all took place. Training of religious leaders raised awareness
but the influence on the broader communities requires the inclusion of other community groups.
The most significant contribution was the generation of knowledge for the system through the Disruptive
Harm research study. The training materials developed (social service workers, educators, SAPS) were of
high quality, though the training of educators was limited to two districts in the Eastern Cape. The method
to reach social service workers through accredited online modules for CPD was effective. SAPS and justice
officials still need to be trained and the guidance of other service providers, such as community-based
workers, mental and health care workers, and NPA, among others, to children is recommended.
Commitment on a national level was high for some government departments (including DSD, DBE, and
FPB) while others would need stronger relationship-building activities and awareness of the implications of
thinking and working systemically. Civil society, a stakeholder group with a huge potential contribution, was
not optimally included. Some national child rights NGOs participated in training events but their
contributions in advocacy, service provision and implementation of programme activities were not evident.
10
The outcomes have not been realised at this stage of the programme as the intended results hinge on
further strengthening of the system. Repeat measures, such as a follow-up Disrupting Harm study and the
evaluation of the next phase, will provide information on targets reached for outcomes in the future.
DAC criteria and equity
The results of the DAC criteria varied between programme components and within the different pillars of
the programme. Relevance and effectiveness were generally rated high and coherence and sustainability
low.
Relevance
The UNICEF programme was relevant to the time, needs, and situation in South Africa and contributed to
global efforts. Some components need more directed effort (ICT and service provision) while additional
government departments and civil society need to be included. The programme was relevant to the reform
needed in legislation and will expand once the knowledge it generates is disseminated more widely. The
Disrupting Harm study made a significant contribution locally and internationally.
Coherence
The programme’s knowledge generation contributed significantly to global efforts, such as the Global
Partnership to End Violence alliance’s We Protect programme and the SDG targets 5.2, 8.7, and 16.2.
However, coherence within the system was low and there was limited collaboration between
subcomponents and within the components of the programme.
Effectiveness
The effectiveness of the programme was linked to knowledge generation. System-wide awareness of COS
was achieved and although more effort will be needed to roll out the training to other stakeholders not yet
included in the programme activities, the high-quality materials developed thus far will enable this. Children
need to be engaged in innovative methods other than the wider media advocacy used so far, including
peer-to-peer dialogue using existing leverage points such as the learners’ representative council structures
at schools. The effectiveness of the system will be improved through a dedicated and inclusive steering
mechanism with representation from all stakeholder groups. Including children will highlight the uniqueness
of the COS system and its challenges and reveal innovative and relevant solutions.
Efficiency
The programme had two no-cost extensions to complete some activities affected by the Covid-19
pandemic. The extensions did not influence the quality of programme delivery or the allocation of budget
items. The optimal use of partner and consultant skills and structures (including existing processes) enabled
a cost-effective programme.
Sustainability
The sustainability of the programme results was generally low. Some activities did not take place and the
replacement interventions did not achieve the desired effect. In this regard, the ICT industry’s commitment
is critically needed. The practicability of the knowledge generated is high, but without dissemination of the
information to all stakeholder groups, it will lose its effect. Despite this, the sustainability of the system itself
was high. This was mostly due to the structural integrity of the system as it was based on existing networks
and procedures (mainly based on government structures).
Equity and gender responsiveness
The programme did not address gender or equity directly. Strengthening the system focused on the
assumption that all children with access to the internet were equally at risk and that structures should be in
place to provide blanket protection. Targeted interventions for groups identified as more vulnerable need
to be included in the next phase of the programme. Children’s voices must be included on a continuous
basis. Power discrepancies between stakeholder groups were evident with larger government departments
being more likely to drive the process. UNICEF was able to harness these strengths but, going forward, an
11
approach of inclusiveness and participation of all stakeholder groups (including a wider range of
government departments) will be needed.
System changes
The essential knowledge generated ensured a solid system foundation. The unique character of the COS
system, including the range of victims involved, perpetrators who are children, the technical skills of children
that frequently surpass those of adult caregivers, and the mixture of physical and online violence, makes
treatment and prevention distinct from general CP issues. Furthermore, solutions such as simply avoiding
the threat are not applicable. This was highlighted by the Covid-19 pandemic’s implications on education
and learning. The COS system needs to be recognized as unique.
There was limited interaction between stakeholders and even within sub-systems. It is important to consider
the dynamic nature of the system where a balance needs to be maintained in controlling and regulating the
access of predators whilst ensuring internet access to all children and providing protection and treatment
to those affected by online vulnerability and violations. There is a need for the inclusion of other components
as well as stakeholder groups within a component (for example, diversification of training to community
members). Understanding the dynamic nature of the interaction between the system's components and the
system-wide implications of change within subsystems is critical to its strength.
The most important consideration is the use of touchpoints in the system where stakeholder groups can be
engaged. Leverage points in the system where the interventions can be more effective need to be identified
and used. These include RCL systems in schools, the involvement of CBOs that work with children, and
online games and applications.
Good practices and lessons learned
There were four good practices in the system that should be highlighted:
1) The recognition that system transformation is needed and that this should be addressed
systemically
2) Building a solid foundation of knowledge about the system on which to base interventions
3) Incorporating the key subsystems
4) Identifying peer-to-peer dialogue as an effective method to engage children
The lessons learned include programme implementation using a system approach and delineating the
boundaries of the Child Online Safety system within the Child Rights strategy. There are elements not
included in the Child Protection system and a solution should be sought outside those traditionally used for
violence against children.
Recommendations
Recommendation 1:
UNICEF South Africa COS programme staff should strategically reflect on the systemic nature and
boundaries of the COS system, how it influences the second phase of the programme, and how the various
programme interventions and stakeholders fit into the broader COS system. UNICEF CP staff can then
influence the higher-level understanding and implementation of systems-thinking in key government
departments such as DSD and DBE.
(Priority: high; Timeframe: immediate; Responsibility: UNICEF CP)
12
Recommendation 2:
UNICEF South Africa COS programme staff should ensure that the important stakeholders targeted in the
original programme proposal and who were not reached are included in the second phase of the
programme (ICT industry, CS, DCDT, SAPS, and DOJ). UNICEF South Africa can likewise play an
important advocacy role in advocating for the inclusion of additional stakeholders (DHA and DOH) and
enhancing relationships between subsystems and stakeholders.
(Priority: high and critical; Timeframe: immediate; Responsibility UNICEF CP)
Recommendation 3:
UNICEF South Africa CP technical advisors should play a coordinating role in identifying touch points
(spaces where children and community members can be engaged) and leverage points in the system that
offer the greatest impact and then communicate this to the implementing partners as a high priority.
(Priority: high; Timeframe: short-term; Responsibility: UNICEF CP manager and those providing technical
support to partners)
Recommendation 4:
The role-players in the COS system and the programme as managed by UNICEF South Africa should move
from awareness activities to more specific interventions. This includes expanding the depth of work with
children beyond just reach, and including and strengthening other system structures and components.
UNICEF South Africa is uniquely situated to influence the strategic move to more targeted interventions.
(Priority: high; Timeframe: short term; Responsibility: UNICEF COS programme and all other implementing
partners)
Recommendation 5:
UNICEF South Africa COS staff and its research partners should investigate and identify the most
vulnerable and marginalized groups in each sub-system, address power issues that threaten COS and
prevent optimal intervention, and measure changes for these groups.
(Priority: high; Timeframe: long-term; Responsibility: UNICEF CP and MEL; research partners, SAPS, DoJ,
NPA)
Recommendation 6:
UNICEF South Africa MEL should urgently develop a functional and dynamic M&E system for the UNICEF
COS programme (phase 2). The system should allow reflection on progress towards targets and capture
and reflect on system transformation.
(Priority: critical; Timeframe: immediate; Responsibility: UNICEF CP and MEL)
Recommendation 7:
UNICEF South Africa and DSD should urgently prioritize the sharing of research, such as the Disrupting
Harm and Kids Online studies, as well as the knowledge generated, and lessons learned during the material
development efforts.
(Priority: urgent for other activities to follow; Timeframe: immediate; Responsibility: UNICEF CP, DSD,
research, and development partners
13
Recommendation 8:
UNICEF South Africa should influence the collaborative process to develop a South African Model National
Response with whole system participation, including child representation.
(Priority: high; Timeframe: immediate; Responsibility: UNICEF CP and all stakeholder groups, not
dominated by any single entity or government department)
Recommendation 9:
UNICEF South Africa should ensure that future programme evaluations include children’s voices and
strategically plan for a subsequent Disrupting Harm study.
(Priority: medium; Timeframe: long-term; Responsibility: UNICEF South Africa MEL, research consultants)

1. INTRODUCTION
This evaluation report describes the system transformation of the UNICEF, Global Partnership funded
programme to strengthen the online safety of children in South Africa (May 2018 to December 2021). The
report is based on UNICEF Global Evaluation Reports Oversight System (GEROS) quality assurance
standards. It was submitted to UNICEF South Africa on the 14th of April 2022 and presented to the Evidence
Reference Group (ERG) on the 4th of May 2022 with feedback incorporated to finalize the report. See
Annex I for the Terms of Reference and Annex II for the ERG composition.
The objective of the report is to: describe the background of the evaluation; explain the scope, purpose,
and methodology; report on the findings, conclusions and lessons learned; and propose recommendations.
The key activities included:
• Preparation for data collection and undertaking of data collection from identified targeted stakeholders,
including the processing of the collected data.
• Providing a technical and analytical overview of all relevant documentation received so that
programmatic data and documents for output analysis can be compared to funding obligations.
• Analysis of activities, frequencies, and trends during the life cycle of the Strengthening Children’s Online
Safety Programme.
• Stakeholder interviews for triangulation of programme data and evidence as part of the qualitative
component of this external evaluation.
• Drafting the preliminary and final reports according to UNICEF's quality assurance guidelines.
• Developing and delivering a presentation of the draft results to stakeholders for feedback and input.
The main issues that arose during the review phase included:
• A Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system and database that could integrate the information from the
different subsystems was not available for review, making a traditional results-focused evaluation
difficult. As this programme worked towards system transformation, analyses of results were supported
by system transformation analysis to ensure that valuable changes occurring in the system but not
captured in the traditional logframes were made visible. It was decided during the inception phase that
less focus would be placed on the assessment of results (outputs and outcomes) and the impact on
children would be excluded as this was not reasonably achievable within the programme’s lifetime. The
focus thus remained on system transformation and identifying gaps and leverage points in the system
to be addressed.
• The data collection phase occurred during the financial year-end for most government departments
and organisations (31 March). This impacted availability of key collaborators but, other than delays in
data collection, this did not affect the data quality. The challenge was alleviated through repeat
invitations and the commitment of the key stakeholders to contribute to the evaluation.
The report is structured to include the background and context, the UNICEF programme, evaluation
scope, conceptual framework for evaluation and theory of change, methodology, results, conclusions
(with good practices, lessons learned), and final recommendations. The results include discussions of the
traditional criteria followed by the system changes.

2. BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
This section presents the evaluation within the broader global and national context and, more widely, the
violence against children (VAC) narrative. This is specific to the situation of VAC in South Africa and its
linkages to the online safety of children.
2.1 Child welfare and safety globally
Child welfare is a high priority globally, with the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) adopted by
the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in 1989. Target 16.2 of the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) calls on all countries to “end abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against,
and torture of, children” by 2030. Other SDGs include Target 5.2 (the elimination of all forms of violence
against women and girls) and Target 8.7 (eradicate child labour and human trafficking).
The World Health Organization (WHO) leads the development of an evidence-based technical package
called INSPIRE: Seven strategies for ending violence against children. The seven strategies, that also form
part of the UNICEF Online child protection programme, are: implementation and enforcement of
laws; norms and values change; safe environments; parental and caregiver support; income and
economic strengthening; response services provision; and education and life skills.
The Economist Intelligence Unit (2020) conducted the Out of the Shadows benchmarking study covering
60 countries (including South Africa) to evaluate stakeholder responses to sexual violence against children.
The index includes four main aspects (environment, legal framework, government commitment, and the
capacity and engagement of industry, social society, and media). The index found that: sexual abuse occurs
within all contexts (rich and poor countries and settings alike); data and measurement are seriously lacking
globally; and country action is mostly related to legal frameworks while performance varies greatly on
government commitment and capacity.
2.2 Violence against children in South Africa, policies, and
interventions
South Africa has high levels of violence against children (Meinck et al., 2016). The South African child
homicide rate is 5.5 homicides per 100 000 children, twice the global average (Mathews, et al., 2013). Artz
and co-workers (2016) reported that 34.4% of children experience physical abuse (compared to 23% global
average) and 19.8% experience sexual abuse (compared to the global average of 18% for girls and 8% for
boys). One in eight South African children report neglect (WHO, 2014). Mathews and Martin (2016) found
that 85% of unnatural infant deaths were caused by abandonment. Older male children were
disproportionately dying due to interpersonal violence with other males. The cost of VAC is extremely high
considering its social, economic, mental, and physical health consequences. Save the Children reported
the cost as R238 billion in 2015 (Fang, 2016; Hsiao, et al., 2018). Despite the cost, funding for interventions
remains low and, similarly, implementation is lacking despite strong legislation and policies.
The legislation and policies include (South African Government, 2021): The Domestic Violence Act, 1998;
The National Council Against Gender Based Violence (NCAGBV); The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences
and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007 (Act No. 32 of 2007)—also referred to as the Sexual
Offences and Related Matters Act; The Children’s Act, 2005 and the Children’s Amendment Act, 2007; The
Women Empowerment and Gender Equality Bill; The National Action Plan; and the Prevention and
Combating of Trafficking in Persons. However, there is still no integrated service or holistic approach.
16
Some of the actions taken by the South African government (South African Government, 2021) include the
toll-free Gender-based Violence Command Centre; the establishment of 11 Sexual Offences Courts;
shelters for victims of gender-based violence and Thuthuzela care centres (TCCs)—one-stop centres that
enable rape victims to lodge a case with the police and receive counselling and medical care; Victim-
Friendly Rooms (VFRs); and a My Safety Plan to assist victims of domestic violence in escaping violent
attacks.
2.3 Online violence
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child includes the rights to expression, privacy,
information, play, and protection from harm. Internet access can enhance or restrict children’s opportunities.
Key insights from the Global Kids Online report (UNICEF, 2019) are:
• Children’s internet access: Home is the most common place for children of all age groups to access
the internet, especially the youngest. Children mostly use a mobile phone to access the internet and
they spend more time online during weekends. In some countries, children’s access to the internet is
equal, whereas in others, boys and older children enjoy better access.
• Parental mediation and support: Younger children receive more support and greater restrictions.
Parents in middle-income countries (including South Africa) support children’s internet use significantly
less than parents in high-income countries, which leads to more diverse internet activities.
• Online activities: More access to, and experience of, the online environment led to new and diverse
activities. Children in less affluent countries are far less likely to watch videos and play games online.
Restricting some online activities may have the unintended consequence of also reducing engagement
in other activities.
• Digital skills: Children’s engagement in online ‘entertainment’ activities is associated with positive
digital skills development. Restricting children’s internet use harms their information-seeking and
privacy skills. Supportive, non-restrictive approaches by parents to children’s online activities are likely
to be most effective in the development of positive digital skills.
• Children’s reporting of online risks: Fewer than one-third of children were upset by exposure to
something online in the past year, mostly related to hate speech, sexual content, being treated in a
hurtful way online, or meeting someone after being introduced online. Watching videos, playing games,
or interacting socially online do not leave children upset unless exposed to certain content or conduct
(e.g., sexual content or harassment). The number of online activities in which children engage, the
digital skills they develop, and the online risks increase as children get older. An enabling approach by
parents to children’s online activities slightly improves their development of digital skills and slightly
reduces their exposure to online risks.
We Protect Global Alliance (2019) describes four lenses that create the sphere of harm. These include
technology, offenders, victims, and socio-economic factors (see Figure 1).

3. UNICEF: STRENGTHENING CHILDREN’S
ONLINE SAFETY IN SOUTH AFRICA
The Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children was launched by the UN Secretary-General in
2016 to end all forms of violence against children by 2030. There are over 360 partners globally, including
civil society organizations, governments, foundations, corporations, academic institutions, faith
communities, and UN agencies. The End Violence Fund has invested $32 million in 37 projects for
preventing and eliminating online child sexual exploitation and abuse. African countries included in this
funding are South Africa, Namibia, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Madagascar, and Ghana.
The UNICEF Global Partnership programme in South Africa sought to strengthen children’s safe use
of the internet and protect them from online violence. In May 2018, UNICEF, in partnership with key
government departments, including the Departments of Social Development (DSD) and Basic Education
(DBE), implemented the child online protection initiative under the Global End Violence programme. It
sought to clarify the extent of the problem and the gaps in policy and implementation attached to it, as well
as:
• Undertake a consultative, participatory and cross-sectoral process to build commitment and ownership
to address the issue;.
• Identify appropriate prevention and response actions to be integrated into relevant legislation, policy,
and capacity-building efforts for service providers.
• Engage with industry to implement online safety standards and complement this with practical, tested
interventions to build the knowledge and skills of children, caregivers, teachers, and communities.
Other key stakeholders, such as the Department of Communications and Digital Technology (DCDT,
previously called Telecommunications and Postal Services), Police (SAPS) and Justice (DOJ), the National
Prosecution Authority (NPA), and key civil society organizations (CSO) were anticipated to join the action.
The aim was for all phases of the programme to be designed within the broader framework of the Model
National Response (MNR) and INSPIRE Package and integrated within the broader strategies to promote
internet access within South Africa whilst protecting children from all forms of violence, abuse, and
exploitation. The approach sought to effectively link evidence, influence policy development and services
for children, develop the knowledge and skills of children and caregivers, and outline industry standards
concerning online safety. These measures were planned to be embedded within broader efforts related to
the protection of children.
Specific deliverables were selected to form a comprehensive package to pilot the project's various
components in an integrated manner. These included strengthening services, increasing the knowledge
and skills of children, caregivers and communities, and implementing industry standards. The programme
was budgeted at US$999,615 and targeted four primary stakeholder levels:
• The individual, family and community
• The services sector
• Industry (Information and Communication Technology [ICT])
• Systems
The four levels represented four pillars, or subcomponents, of the programme, targeting teams that could
strengthen the online safety of children (Figure 2 illustrates the four pillars intended in the programme
proposal). The programme did not focus on connections between the components and treated these as
sub-programmes.
19
Figure 2: Subcomponents of the programme
As this programme was essentially a system programme it did not focus on children as the ultimate
beneficiaries (rights-holders) but instead concentrated interventions on capacitating the duty-bearers (those
who interact with children, provide services to them, develop legislation, and enforce the law). There was
no targeting of specific groups based on age or gender amongst the stakeholders and beneficiaries. No
demographic data was available for any of the beneficiary groups (parents, community members, and,
ultimately, children) at the individual level. Training for community members was restricted to religious
leaders regardless of age or gender. Service providers, specifically educators, were targeted
geographically and training was offered to all social service workers and Child and Youth Care Workers
(CYCW). The educators who undertook training came from two districts in the Eastern Cape province
chosen for their convenience due to the Covid-19 restrictions. The Department of Social Development
(DSD) offered online training to all registered social service workers. No police or justice officials were
trained nor were any ICT industry members included in the programme. Most of the intended partners and
stakeholders were national government officials and organizational personnel without specification for age
or gender and no demographic data was recorded for any of these groups.
The intended outcomes for the respective subcomponents are listed below:
1) Children, families, and communities protect children from online violence and help access
services when needed. Strengthen the knowledge and skills of children, families, and
communities to enable children to use the internet safely and access services if they become a
victim of online violence.
2) Children benefit from key services that help them stay safe online and respond to the needs
of child survivors. Evidence would be used to integrate child online safety knowledge and skills
into the existing capacity-building efforts of key service providers.
3) Information and Communication Technology (ICT) industry implements standards and measures
to prevent and address online violence. Advocacy would be conducted with ICT actors, such as
Vodacom, MTN, and Telkom for endorsement and implementation of the Guidelines for Industry
on Child Online Protection.
20
4) National authorities and civil society have increased knowledge and commitment to
addressing online safety. The proficiency and commitment of national authorities and civil society
in addressing children's online safety would be strengthened.
The stakeholder map (Figure 3) attempts to illustrate the different levels of influence and interest for each
of the stakeholder groups. Groups that were initially included in the programme proposal but not included
in the programme activities are indicated with dashed lines.

Geographical aspects
The programme focused on South Africa nationally. Online training for children included platforms such as
Facebook, TikTok, and Twitter. Parents were reached through a module added to the Sinovuyo parenting
programme as well as programmes by DSD. Targeting took place nationally through online and televised
webinars (SABC and ETV). The training of educators focused on two districts in the Eastern Cape Province
as a starting point, with 100 educators from each trained in Mthatha and East London. There were no further
specific targets or proportional representation based on socio-economic status or geographical location,
although in-person training of service providers favoured rural areas (as mentioned regarding the training
of educators).
Timeline of programme implementation
The programme started on 23 February 2018 and envisaged to end on 26 February 2021. Two no-cost
extensions were granted due to the effect of Covid-19 restrictions on programme activities. The first
extension was to 31 August 2021, with the second stretching to 31 December 2021.
3.1 Programme assumptions
The programme assumptions (based on programme documents, literature on the topic, and implicit to the
justification of the programme) included:
• The project stems from evidence that online violence is strongly correlated to other forms of (offline)
violence and applicable responses must be incorporated.
• Increased knowledge and understanding of the gaps in information and interventions will guide the
programme and national structures (government and civil society) to change the systemic environment
(through policies, guidelines, and national mechanisms).
• There is goodwill from key gatekeepers and commitment from all partners, including the ICT industry.
The programme funding proposal listed assumptions related to implementation risks. These included:
• Despite support from key government Departments, including DSD, coordination between government
departments and actors from civil society and academia remain a challenge to combat VAC.
• Violence against children is high on the SA Government’s agenda but is a relatively politicized topic.
• Through the Kids Online Study, understanding and commitment to addressing the issue has been
established within some departments but others are less engaged. Additionally, champions within
particular departments may be redeployed at some point of the programme.
• There is a need for timely integration of this issue within ongoing legislative and policy reforms and a
risk that the evidence from the national representative evaluation will not be ready to guide these efforts.
• The online safety risk and high visibility of incidents of child sexual exploitation in media may create an
overly restrictive approach to children’s online usage among the public, parents, and service providers.
• The project must carefully balance promoting safe online use by children while mitigating the
aforementioned risks.
The Covid-19 pandemic impacted programme implementation (delayed and cancelled activities) and the
evaluation (limiting face-to-face interactions with stakeholders). The pandemic demonstrated implications
24
for online violence as it compelled children to learn online and through home-schooling (End Violence,
2021). It highlighted the benefit of internet access and accelerated the implementation of protective
measures by some partners, such as DBE.
25
4. EVALUATION OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE
4.1 Aim, purpose, and objectives
This is a summative evaluation of the Global End Violence Fund Programme of the United Nations
Children’s Fund (UNICEF) in South Africa. The programme aimed to strengthen the online system by
ensuring children are safe online and able to access support should they fall victim to online abuse. The
Evaluation provides observations on the efficacy of the programme to empower front-line workers and
service providers, including educators and social service providers such as Child and Youth Care Workers
(CYCW), communities, families, and children themselves.
The purpose of this summative evaluation is to assess relevance, coherence, efficiency, effectiveness, and
sustainability. The specific objectives of the evaluation, as per the terms of reference (See Annex I), were
the following:
1) Assess the outcomes and outputs of the programme implementation in line with the set objectives.
2) Critically analyse the effectiveness and efficiency of the programme outcomes and outputs.
3) Provide lessons learned and recommendations aimed at informing programme improvement in
addition to assessing the ultimate value of the program to participants and stakeholders.
4) Provide lessons learned and best practices to share with the Global Partnership and other
countries.
5) Gauge the extent to which the objectives in safeguarding children online have been achieved in
consideration of child rights and gender equity.
The evaluation will also assist to:
• Inform programme users of the relevance of the programme in awareness and knowledge building.
• Document lessons learned and share instruments derived from the Partnership investment.
• Serve as a baseline to develop the Model National Response (MNR) for South Africa (SA).
4.1.1 Audience and use of evaluation findings
The primary audience for this evaluation is the stakeholders of all the subsystems that form part of the
broader child online safety (COS) strategy, including government departments, civil society, research and
development partners, and service providers. The South African and global UNICEF Child Protection units
and the Global Partnership to End Violence will use the findings to review. Factors such as awareness,
availability, and the use of monitoring data will be used to inform programme staff. The report will also guide
the redirection of activities, the importance of finalizing incomplete activities, and the need to include
stakeholders who were left out of this phase of the online child safety activities.
The Evaluation Reference Group (ERG) will be responsible for the dissemination and application of the
evaluation findings. The ERG will supply recommendations to relevant partners, including government
departments, civil society, business, and academic institutions. This includes recommendations for the
development of the Model National Response (MNR) for the online protection of all children across the six
pillars of the MNR. Within the context of the Global Partnership, the evaluation would serve to document
the work South Africa has done in the online protection space. The constitution of the ERG in Annex II, and
the intended users and stakeholders of the evaluation, are presented in Annex III.
26
4.2 Scope of the evaluation
The scope of this evaluation covered national programme activities in South Africa. The activities under
evaluation were implemented in May 2018 and scheduled to conclude in August 2021. However, the global
pandemic saw the programme activities concluded during the inception phase of the evaluation (31
December 2021). The evaluation centred on programme activities and an analysis of their relevance,
coherence, effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability. As per the project plan (described in Section 3 and
Table 1), the main activities of the programme consisted of:
• Developing a tool for communication and dialogue.
• Drafting messages to raise awareness of online protection for caregivers and children.
• Developing a training toolkit for online protection.
• Undertaking training of various sets of duty-bearers in online protection.
• Undertaking a national assessment to gauge the extent of child rights violations.
The evaluation scope did not include measurements or verification of the programme's impact in
strengthening the child online safety system and it was unlikely to have impacted children during this phase
of the programme. The evaluation also excluded children as respondents since the goal was system
transformation. Additional data within the research reports provided insights into the needs of children and
the challenges they experience. The evaluation did not assess training events (including knowledge
transferred) since this role fell to the monitoring system for immediate feedback to the programme and the
aim was system transformation rather than knowledge levels. The evaluation attempted to determine the
application in training service providers (educators, social service workers, and religious leaders) and its
practical value in strengthening the system.
The systemic nature of the intervention is important, and a systems approach was used to assess
transformation within the system and its sub-components. This did not change the scope of the evaluation
but provided a separate conceptual model to evaluate the programme (Annex I: Terms of Reference - ToR).
For more information on the Evaluability Assessment see the Inception Report. The evaluating consultant
was tasked with the following responsibilities:
• Retroactively reconstruct a programme theory of change (ToC).
• Conduct an assessment at the initial phase of the evaluation to inform refinements to the preliminary
evaluation questions and evaluation design.
• Review proposal documents, project agreements, reports, surveys, training tools, and materials
produced under this partnership structure as per the initially agreed result framework.
• Assess and analyse the quality and content of all documents and tools produced because of the
aforementioned investment.
• Keep all instruments and records of relevance to UNICEF and DSD on a central database.
• Evaluate the programme results.
• Document partnerships developed throughout the project.
• Prepare the interview tools to assess the satisfaction of partners as part of the qualitative component
of this evaluation and conduct interviews with stakeholders involved in the project.
• Present initial findings and results to UNICEF and members of the Evaluation Reference Group.
• Provide a draft inception and evaluation report with preliminary recommendations to the Evaluation
Reference Group for validation.
• Compile the final inception, draft, and evaluation reports based on periodic feedback from stakeholders.
27
4.3 Assumptions of the evaluation
Of the assumptions made during the evaluability assessment and inception phase, the most critical was
that the programme worked towards system transformation as this was the focus of the programme. The
implication was that children would ultimately be served by the transformed system. However, children
need to be included in the next evaluation to assess how system transformation affected them.
No causality was attributed. The theory of change was constructed, and iterative adaptations were made
as data revealed system changes.
Regarding data collection, the following assumptions were made:
• Documents would be available for review – correct assumption.
• Respondents were available - commitment was initially lower than expected but additional effort was
made by the evaluator and the programme staff, which resulted in adequate responses and data
saturation.
• Timely access to the documents and the data – correct assumption.
• Adequate data to perform basic descriptive statistics – calculations of reported data were not
possible as no M&E system and database was designed or used for the programme. This was in part
due to the nature of the programme working with different subsystems and not being able to provide a
clear formula for the calculation of these numbers. This gap is addressed in the findings and
recommendations.
• Data would be available from different subsystems to reflect all perspectives of the system -
some subsystems were in a more advanced transformational stage than others. Others were not
actively part of the programme (e.g., the ICT industry) and their views could not be included in the
evaluation. Data saturation from the contributions was reached and triangulation ensured the
trustworthiness of the data related to completed activities.
28
5. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK AND THEORY
OF CHANGE
5.1 Theoretical basis of evaluation
The evaluation used systems thinking since the programme's aim was the transformation of the whole
system as it ultimately engages with children and ensures their online safety (Van den Berg, Magro, &
Adrien, 2021). It was important to understand the system structure and the changes over time in relation to
the programme. The bio-ecological system model views the child within distinct subsystems (Figure 4).
Whilst the evaluation did not focus on children specifically, it continuously and intentionally considered all
systems affecting a child’s development (Bronfenbrenner & Morris 2006; Madeline 2017; Psychology Notes
HQ. 2019). Subsystems in this model included the individual; microsystem (family and community);
mesosystem (service level); macrosystem (national authorities and civil society), and other contextual
and environmental factors. This approach allowed a human rights and equity focus gender-sensitive
(EFGS) lens to be used as the scope of the evaluation included power relations and their implications for
the transformation of the system.
Figure 4: Theoretical framework
5.1.1 Working conceptual framework for evaluation
The conceptual framework allowed the evaluation to merge the perspectives of different groups and
subsystems, allowing a deeper understanding of the whole system's structure, the changes within the
system, and its parts (inter-dependence). The conceptual framework highlighted the different role players
in the system working on protective measures for internet use, mitigating actions, and reporting options for
those who fall victims to online violence. The child remains the ultimate target beneficiary of the system
transformation focus.
29
5.2 Programme Theory of Change
The logframe described the programme theory (see Annex IV), which is traditionally defined more linearly
even if the programme is complex. The representation in Figure 5 shows the four pillars (blue) of the
programme with the main stakeholders (light blue) being affected. The outputs of interventions (light green)
lead to shorter- and longer-term outcomes (orange) and the ultimate expected impact (yellow) on child
safety and treatment offered to victims of abuse and online violence. There are limited interrelations
between the interventions and outcomes of the four sub-components of the programme.
Figure 5: Theory of Change – traditional linear
However, the programme's aim was to bring about and strengthen the system and its subsystems, a
complex structure with many interrelationships between the four subsystems targeted in the programme.
Figure 6 represents an alternative ToC with the same programme but focused on the interactions between
subsystems or pillars. The intended system transformation is then a consequence of changes in one system
affecting changes in other sub-systems and dynamic interactions between its components. Not only are
there subsystems within Child Online Safety (COS), but the COS system forms part of other larger
formations, such as child protection (CP) and internet provision systems amongst many others. The
interaction between all these systems and sub-systems is critical to strengthening the COS system and
30
goes beyond interventions to a specific stakeholder group. The child is not only a recipient of the programme
intervention but sits at the centre as the ultimate beneficiary, of the many systems.
Figure 6: Theory of Change – adapted to illustrate system
31
6. METHODOLOGY
The evaluation was a summative external evaluation. It was explanatory based on mostly qualitative data
from key informant interviews (KII) with some data from surveys. The evaluation questions and methods
are human rights-based (including child rights) and gender transformative and consider equity of various
groups.
The evaluation was conducted in accordance with United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) Norms and
Standards for evaluations and the inception and evaluation reports were developed in line with the UNICEF
Global Evaluation Reports Oversight System (GEROS) quality assurance standards.
The methods described systems changes and transformation and aimed to understand the progress,
achievements, and shortcomings of the implemented programme on the respective subsystems and the
system as a whole. Although no causality was attributed, descriptions of the system transformation ensured
realistic recommendations, lessons learned, and good practices.
6.1 Evaluation criteria and questions
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance
Committee (DAC) criteria of relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability guided the
evaluation. Additional questions focused on descriptions of the system and any transformation achieved.
Less emphasis was placed on investigating progress towards targets set for output and outcome results,
and impact measurement was not included in the study (due to the early transformational stage of the
system).
The main questions for each of the criteria are listed below. The full evaluation matrix, including the sub-
questions, indicators, data sources, and methods are available in Annex V. The questions were refined at
various stages of the preparation phase, including the evaluability assessment and iterative feedback from
the Evaluation Reference Group (ERG).
• Relevance:
• To what extent did the programme intervention's objectives and design respond to beneficiaries and
partner institution's needs, policies, and priorities, and will it continue if circumstances change?
• Were the objectives and design of the interventions sensitive to the economic, environmental, child
rights, gender, equity, social, political economy, and capacity conditions in which they took place?
• Coherence:
• To what extent were the programme's interventions aligned with national priorities and policies on
safeguarding children online?
• What would improve coherence and coalescence with relevant national norms, standards, priorities,
and policies, including child rights, equity, and gender equality?
• Effectiveness:
• To what extent were the programme's interventions achieved based on its objectives and results,
including any differential effects across groups whilst factoring in gender and national equity
considerations?
• What were the significant factors influencing the achievement or non-achievement of the objectives,
programme outputs, and outcomes?
32
• Were there any significant differential results by gender and subgroups, and what were the causes?
• Efficiency:
• To what extent did the intervention deliver the planned results in a cost-effective and timely manner?
Were resources used strategically, and was value achieved against the final investment?
• What were the main factors that supported or impeded the delivery of programme results?
• Were the chosen strategies the most cost-effective and efficient? Were there alternatives that could
have worked better, and, if so, what were they?
• Sustainability:
• To what extent were the net benefits of the programme's interventions likely to continue based on
the institutional capacities and instruments developed via the programme?
• Which factors could improve the programme's sustainability if it were to be expanded or replicated
to sustain net benefits over time?
• System description and transformation
• To what extent did the intervention produce or, is expected to produce, significant positive or
negative, intended, or unintended results?
• Were there secondary, or potential, consequences of the programme's interventions?
• To what extent would changes in systems, behaviours, or norms be attained?
6.2 Data collection methods
The data collection included a broad range of stakeholders and data sources and utilised the following
methods:
6.2.1 Desk review
Document reviews took place at various stages of the evaluation. They helped frame the approach during
the inception phase and were used to extract evidence for various evaluation questions during the validation
phase. The desk review involved an examination of programme documents and reports, materials and
documents developed during the evaluation, and government policies and legislation. The literature review
included research studies internal to the programme (e.g., Disrupting Harm and National Kid's Online) as
well as external documents and research reports. See Annex VI for the list of documents reviewed.
6.2.2 Primary and secondary data from other sources
The programme proposal document (30 Sept 2017) described the plan to be developed and recommended
that a Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system and tools would be produced for the programme. The tools
and data sets were not realised so no data was available for verification. Progress towards targets as
reported to donors could not be verified and calculations were not formalized to allow independent analysis.
No monitoring tools (including pre-and-post-test data for individual training and social mobilization
interventions) were developed or available to the evaluator, and neither were media monitoring and tracking
data or minutes of meetings.
33
There was an expectation by the evaluator that secondary data would be available from partners (including
civil society), government departments, and other sector stakeholders. Very little data and information on
online safety exists nationally, however.
6.2.3 Key informant interviews
In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with key informants. These covered programme
implementers and partners through to individuals and groups with viewpoints of the system and subsystems
who could comment on system transformation. Annex VII reports on the key informants interviewed, the
motivation for inclusion, and reasons for non-participation. 15 key interviews took place with the following
groups:
• UNICEF staff: country office (CO), specifically Child Protection (CP).
• Government departments: DSD, DBE, Films and Publication Board (FPB), and the Law Reform
Commission (LRC)
• Research partners: Bureau for Market Research (BMR) at University of South Africa (UNISA)
• Materials development partner
• Programme implementing partners: Media Monitoring Africa and Agape Youth Movement.
• Civil society: Teddy Bear Clinic and Save the Children South Africa.
None of the following groups were interviewed as they were not included or affected by the programme
activities:
• Government stakeholders: The Department of Communication and Digital Technology (DCDT),
Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of Home Affairs (DHA), and South African Police Service
(SAPS) were not included in the programme activities.
• The Information and Communication Technology (ICT) industry (Google SA, Facebook SA, Vodacom,
MTN, Telkom) was not included in programme interventions.
• Civil society (Childline) did not respond to repeated invitations to participate.
• Government departments such as DSD and DBE have dedicated national mechanisms for child
protection. There is a need for an overarching national instrument dedicated to COS that consists of all
relevant stakeholders, including civil society, the ICT industry, and children and their caregivers.
Modes of data collection
Due to Covid-19 restrictions data collection took place remotely via Zoom, Teams, or voice calls depending
on the interviewee. No in-person engagements took place and all interviews were one-on-one between the
evaluator and the interviewee. Audio was recorded to supplement notes and deleted once the notes were
updated. The notes and audio-recordings were not shared with any internal or external individual or group.
Sampling
Non-probability, purposive sampling was used. The evaluation scope was national and targeted all
subsystems, areas and locations covered by the interventions. Snow-ball sampling ensured other experts
were included to offer additional insights. There was limited disaggregation of data as the informants
included primary programme stakeholders and not large numbers of beneficiaries. The interviews explored
equity and gender issues, particularly how power influenced programme delivery and which beneficiary
were reached.
34
6.2.4 Online surveys
Online surveys were developed and used to engage with participants of training events. The groups
included:
• Service level participants: 200 educators in the Eastern Cape
• Social service workers: 53 of 249 trainees completed the full programme
• Faith-based organizations (FBO): 35 of 45 trainees were contactable
The programme did not instruct caregivers and parents directly. The intervention was Training of Trainers
(ToT) who would then disseminate the guidance to caregivers. The ToT took place but the trainers have
not yet rolled out the training to parents and caregivers, who were therefore not included in the evaluation.
Some groups were not trained as per the programme plan. This generally due to Covid-19 restrictions on
face-to-face meetings but also a lack of commitment from some departments during the time of the
implementation. These groups included the South African Police Service (SAPS) and justice officials.
The focus of these surveys was on the practical application of the training in catalysing behaviour change
amongst the participants and others who work with children. This provided data on progress in system
transformation and implementation of online safety measures directly with children. It was not an
assessment of the training events themselves or a test of knowledge levels.
Recruitment and sampling
Recruitment happened through emails (social service workers and educators) and WhatsApp (FBO) from
contact lists provided by training implementation partners. An invitation and link to the survey was sent to
all contactable trainees without sampling. Repeat invitations and reminders to participate were sent on three
occasions to increase response rates and all responses were anonymous.
Survey Monkey was used for the distribution and administration of the online survey. The link was shared
with all respondents without targeting. An average response rate of 26% was obtained, with a 24% rate
coming from social service workers, 41% for educators, and 17% for FBO. As the survey sought a
description of the respondent's experiences no control group was used. The response rate was acceptable
as data saturation of open-ended, qualitative data was reached and no new insights emerged.
6.3 Tools
A generic set of questions was developed from the evaluation matrix (see Annex VIII). The questions were
linked to codes for main evaluation questions as some questions were relevant to multiple main evaluation
questions (for example questions and probes about coherence also revealed data on system structure).
The questions relevant to each respondent group were extracted, and used to develop a specific tool, either
Key Informant Interview (KII) schedule or an online survey. The generic question matrix and codes were
used to ensure all the relevant questions were included for each respondent group. Annex IX presents the
different tools used during the evaluation, which included:
• KII schedule for UNICEF staff.
• KII schedule for programme partners (service providers and government departments).
• Online survey for service level participants: Educators.
• Online survey for service level participants: Social service workers.
• Online surveys for community: Faith-Based Organisations.
35
6.4 Analytical approaches
6.4.1 Data analysis
The evaluation matrix (Annex V) was used to categorize and guide the document review and extraction of
secondary data from other documents and data sets.
Key informant interviews: A framework was used to code the data according to the main evaluation
questions. Each interview was analysed as a single unit immediately after the interview, using the audio
recording to supplement the notes. An identifier colour code was assigned to each quote to determine the
questions it related to. Multiple identifier codes per quote were possible as the data was arranged with a
systems approach where answers could be relevant to the DAC criteria and the system description (see
Table 3). The analysis was an iterative process with the same interview being coded repeatedly;
immediately after the interview, again when new codes emerged, and finally, once all interviews were
completed. Once the identifiers were compiled, the quotations for each evaluation question were
thematically analysed, keeping them embedded in the interview to ensure the contextual relevance
remained intact. The generic question matrix (Annex VIII) that steered the development of the different tools
was used as a guide for this purpose. Additional information was tagged and used in the report wherever it
was most relevant.
Online surveys: The data from the online surveys were extracted from Survey Monkey to Excel as raw
data. Quantitative data were analysed using frequencies for close-ended questions. Open-ended questions
were manually analysed using thematic and content analyses. The content analysis included coding the
answers using the framework described above in Table 4. Some of the data contributed to other evaluation
questions and stakeholder groups. Respondents often volunteered how they act as parents and caregivers
to their children and this data was included with the parent perspective. The data were analysed per
stakeholder set and the sets were compared only after the coding was complete.

6.4.2 Integration, triangulation, and data saturation
Integration of data sources and information: The aim was to integrate multiple sources (document
review—where verifiable secondary data existed, KII, and online surveys) and types of data to ensure a full
definition of the system, its components, and its transformation. The analytical framework (Table 3) was the
key component to guide the integration, most of which took place during the coding and analysis. Care was
taken to ensure completeness and coverage of all stakeholder group perspectives and evaluation
questions.
Completeness: The coding matrix aided the inclusion of all perspectives, particularly from stakeholders
involved in the programme activities. The evaluator expected to interview 30 persons for the KIIs but only
half this number participated. Annex VII was developed to catalogue participation and list reasons for each
of the non-respondents to ensure all stakeholder groups were represented. This table was an online,
dynamic shared document, updated daily and tracked by the evaluator and UNICEF staff. Repeated
invitations were sent to make certain all stakeholders had an opportunity to participate (at least three
repetitions). UNICEF CP staff assisted with an introductory letter and follow-ups if the evaluator had
difficulty obtaining a commitment from the stakeholder. In some cases, another key informant was
approached to contribute.
Where data was not available from the KII interviews it was sourced from documents and an extensive
South African-based literature search (105 programme documents and research studies, see Annex VI).
The Disrupting Harm study took preference over other studies and represented some perspectives that
were not included in the interviews or surveys, for example, the issues raised by children and information
on the ICT industry.
Triangulation: The main purpose of triangulation was to ensure the perspectives of all stakeholders were
represented. Each evaluation question was answered by more than two stakeholder groups where it was
relevant to them. The different perspectives were integrated as described above. Data discrepancies were
scrutinised to ensure validity and analyse differences in the system. Discrepancies in most instances were
related to different opinions rather than data error.
Data Saturation: The evaluator is confident that all perspectives were included and data saturation was
reached for both the main evaluation questions and the sub-questions. Interviews continued even after
saturation was reached to ensure that all perspectives were included and to clarify where information was
contradictory or expressed different views.
6.4.3 Trustworthiness
Content, construct, and criterion validity were all addressed during the development of the data collection
tools. Reliability was ensured by reviewing tools internally and externally and via pilot testing.
Trustworthiness was ensured by triangulation of methods (KII, online surveys, and document and literature
reviews), and validating secondary data with interviews, data sources, analysis, and interpretation.
Trustworthiness and rigour of qualitative data and analysis used a four-pronged approach that started
during the inception phase and continued to the dissemination stage.
• Credibility (comprehensive, trustworthy, and sensible explanations); through triangulation and member
checking.
• Transferability; by keeping the contextual factors at the forefront.
• Dependability; keeping accurate recordings (and matching audio recordings with written notes).
• Conformability; through triangulation of data sources and member checking.
38
6.5 Ethics and quality assurance processes
6.5.1 Ethics
As an individual consultancy, ethical conduct was the responsibility of the consultant and a reflection of
their attributes, such as integrity and credibility, as evident through her training and experience in
development and programme evaluations and research studies. The consultant is impartial and has no
conflict of interest in the evaluation or the programme. The consultant's core values guide her ethical
conduct and ensure accountability to the management of the programme and the scientific and evaluation
field. Her main principles include respect for all participants and wider stakeholder groups. She believes in
transformation, participation, inclusion, and equity. As a gender specialist, a gender lens and sensitivity to
cultural differences are applied to all studies. The consultant adhered to UNICEF child safeguarding
principles and standards, including UNICEF's values of Care, Respect, Integrity, Trust, and Accountability
(CRITA), and the UNEG ethical guidelines. All ethical principles were applied when engaging with
participants and handling the data, including beneficence, non-maleficence, confidentiality, and privacy.
While participants may not receive direct benefit from this assessment, the information will be used to inform
the design of any subsequent programme phases. The benefits of collecting a variety of information in a
cost and time-effective methodology (as used in this evaluation) outweighed the potential risks. Information
on the indicators added valuable knowledge on the progress towards transforming the system and
achieving COS. There were no intrusive or invasive medical procedures or potential physical harm to any
participant and questions required no sensitive or personal information to be shared.
UNICEF approached the key players, informed them of the evaluation and invited them to participate. The
consultant followed up on this introduction and shared the letter from UNICEF (Annex X) and a detailed
information document about the study, including ethical considerations. Consent was provided in person
before the data collection. The informed consent form is attached in Annex XI. The interviewer explained
the purpose of the evaluation, the process, and specific research ethics, including the confidentiality of all
data and information. The right to decline to participate, withdraw from the evaluation at any time, or refuse
to answer any question was explained to all participants.
All data sheets were kept confidential and secure, hard copies and written notes were locked in an office,
and electronic information was password protected. Absolute anonymity cannot be guaranteed as the
details and affiliation of each interviewee were known. However, no personally traceable information was
shared during the writing of the report or dissemination of the results. Data analysis focused on cumulative
information and the organizational level rather than individuals. Online surveys were anonymous and no
individual tracking was possible.
To ensure transcripts were accurate, audio recordings of the interviews were taken with informed consent.
All recordings were deleted upon completion of the notes.
No formal ethical review was required as no children were interviewed, no sensitive questions were
included, and no invasive methods were used. This was cleared with the ERG during the inception phase.
The ethics checklist used for this purpose is attached as Annex XII.
No children were included in the evaluation as direct respondents but it is critical to ensure future
programmes (that cascade or work on different subsystems) include child voices. In those instances,
appropriate ethical clearance will be needed in both the programme and evaluation designs.
39
6.5.2 Quality assurance
The evaluation followed United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) Norms and Standards. The reports were
developed according to the UNICEF Global Evaluation Reports Oversight System (GEROS) quality
assurance standards. A double quality control mechanism was in place, using internal and external
mechanisms. Internally, it was led by the consultant's critical reflection and review of the rigour and
trustworthiness of the data and processes. Externally, oversight came from the UNICEF Evaluation
Reference Group, whilst UNICEF country and regional reviewed all deliverables. The GEROS formed the
standard for the reports.
6.6 Evaluation management and logistics
6.6.1 Phases of work and time schedule
There were three phases to the evaluation (unchanged from the ToR):
1) Preparatory and Inception phase
2) Drafting, validation, and completion phase
3) Review phase
The activities, deliverables, and time allocated (45 consulting days) are indicated in Annex XIII. The initial
timeline of the evaluation was 20 weeks. The evaluation phase 1 (inception) started on 1 November 2021
and was intended to conclude by 18 March 2022 with the submission of the final report. The timeline was
extended due to the holiday period (businesses closed for the festive season) and the delay in feedback
needed to finalize the inception report. Some evaluation activities, such as literature search and review,
continued. Further delays stemmed from the challenges in recruiting participants due to the financial year-
end. The finalization of the evaluation was dependent on the review, turn-around time of feedback from the
ERG, and the external quality assurance process.
6.6.2 Consultant and responsibilities
The evaluation was conducted by Dr Madri Jansen van Rensburg, the consultant. Dr van Rensburg was
responsible for all aspects of the evaluation, from design, data collection and management, to drafting
reports. The total number of days contracted was 45 days (15 days for inception, 20 days for drafting the
report, and 10 days for finalization). The emerging evaluator (EE) internship was deemed infeasible due to
the short duration of the evaluation (less than 6 months as required for an internship).
Madri is a proud South African national with substantial education in Health, Social and Business sciences
(2 PhD and 2 MSc), decades of local experience (30+ years working on the African continent and in the
Global South), and 98 projects completed as an independent consultant since 2007. She has a distinct
ability to work with complex data sets and interpret and integrate data from diverse sources. She enjoys
working contextually, seeing similarities and contrasts across cultures and countries. Her passion lies in
participatory methods to include groups that are often excluded. Madri grounds all work in solid theory and
is a systems thinker focusing on the interactions between systems and subsystems rather than the
individual (who ultimately benefits). As a gender specialist, she incorporates a gender lens and cultural
sensitivity to studies. She is a past president of the Africa Gender and Development Evaluators Network
(AGDEN). Madri places a high value on quality assurance, ethical behaviour and validity, reliability, and
trustworthiness of data.
40
6.6.3 Management and logistical support
The evaluation was handled remotely and no site visits or face-to-face interactions took place due to the
4th Covid-19 wave in South Africa and transmission preventative measures. The UNICEF Country Office
(CO) was requested to assist with gatekeeping and recruitment of key informants. The programme manager
helped with requests for documents and secondary data. A letter of introduction was developed to this
effect and is attached as Annex X.
The evaluation reference group (ERG) created by UNICEF represented partner organizations (listed in
Annex III). The role of the ERG was to review deliverables (inception report, draft evaluation report, and
final evaluation report) and form the first line in disseminating evaluation findings.
An external company working at the regional office level assessed the quality of the deliverables.
6.7 Challenges, gaps, and limitations
6.7.1 Challenges
Timing of the evaluation study
There were implications for the timing of the evaluation, which resulted in process delays but did not affect
the data quality or reporting.
• The inception phase commenced at the end of the year (holiday season), which impacted the turn-
around time for the review of the inception report and external quality control.
• The fieldwork stage coincided with the financial year-end (March/April), affecting many key informants
(especially government and NGOs). Repeat invitations ensured that all relevant key informants were
interviewed, although it delayed the review phase of the study by two weeks (to ensure informants had
every opportunity to participate).
Participation
Repeat invitations and introductions facilitated by UNICEF alleviated the initial challenge to recruit
participants. Reasons for non-participation included stakeholders failing to identify the programme as being
its own entity with a specific purpose. This is not a negative aspect since the structural system changes did
not need to be attributed to UNICEF to be effective.
It was anticipated that parents and caregivers who underwent training would also participate to give a closer
view of the effect on children. Parents were mentored using a Training of Trainers (ToT) method.
Participants who had taken part had not yet imparted the training and were unable to offer insight into the
ultimate benefit to parents and children. The three groups of trainees (social service workers, educators,
and FBO) provided valuable insights into behaviour change amongst those who underwent training,
although less information was available regarding the direct effect on children. This confirmed the
assumption that the system changes are still too early to affect children’s behaviour.
Unrealised risks
Risks that were anticipated but did not arise due to prevention measures were the following:
• The unavailability or delay of key documents for desk review was avoided by UNICEF preparing all
documents in advance and sharing them at inception.
• Delays for ethical approval were avoided since no ethical approval was required.
41
• The Protection of Private Information Act (POPI): The resistance of respondents and organizations to
disclose information of key informants was nullified through the preparation of respondents and their
inclusion in the programme leading to high levels of commitment.
• Covid-19 restrictions did not influence participation as online and electronic means of engagement were
used.
6.7.2 Gap
The lack of a formal M&E system and database to verify the reported achievements of targets proved a
challenge. This was unforeseen since a logframe was used to report progress to donors. Not only is an
M&E system a necessity, but the development of a formal system, database, and tools (such as media
monitoring and tracking, minutes of meetings, and pre-and-post-testing during training) was included in the
programme funding proposal. It was assumed during the evaluability assessment that these systems and
datasets were in place. In addition to the adverse effect on the programme, the consequences of not having
a formalized M&E system for the evaluation were the following:
• Data and information reported in funding and other reports could not be verified by the evaluation.
• Data sources, such as minutes of meetings and training reports, were not available.
• Financial data was not available to the evaluator and, although aspects such as efficiency could be
deducted, value for money could not be determined.
• Programme staff were overwhelmed by several concurrent evaluations and, although very committed,
the additional task of compiling data for evaluation was limited by their time and resources.
6.7.3 Limitations
The main methodological limitation was the inability to interview children directly. Not including the
voices and opinions of children was a decision made during the inception phase and the behaviour changes
and impact on children could not be fully investigated. This was due to the programme focusing on
strengthening the system and the impact on the ultimate beneficiaries (children) not being attained within
at least three to five years of having all system changes in place. The opinion and insights of children and
parents were included in the research studies (Disrupting Harm and Kids Online) that guided the
development of the programme. Children’s voices remain the central source of information and the
exclusion of direct interaction with them should not be misinterpreted as indifference to their insights on
system transformation progress. This evaluation focused on system structures, such as training of service
providers, with a clear understanding that children will enjoy the ultimate benefits of an improved system
further down the line. The caveat is that it was only applicable to this stage of the system transformation
and that further programme activities and evaluations will need to concentrate directly on changes for
children as reported by children.
Interviewing people remotely presented a potential bias in data collection. People tend to be more open
about their feelings and experiences in face-to-face engagements and more restrained during remote
discussions. This did not arise during the evaluation as interviewees were able to choose the mode of
engagement (telephone, Zoom, or Microsoft Teams meetings). However, in-person engagements would
likely have been hindered by time commitments and would not have yielded different, or more valid and
reliable data. Online surveys had limited responses, but anonymity encouraged honest responses.

7. RESULTS OF PROGRAMME PROGRESS
This part of the report addresses the finding of the standard evaluation questions on progress, relevance,
effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability, and coherence. Answering these questions is important for
accountability and learning. The system changes are described in the next section (Section 8) to provide a
better understanding of the impact of the programme on the system.
The OECD DAC criteria assessed changes for the stakeholders, specifically the criteria of relevance,
coherence, effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability, while the impact is regarded as consequential to
later stages of system transformation (OECD, 2020). See Figure 7.
Figure 7: OECD DAC criteria
7.1 General findings
There were four pillars to the programme. The first section describes the overall findings using the OECD
DAC criteria as an overview. Subsequent sections describe the findings for each criterion.
43
Programme pillars and intended actions
1) Children, families, and communities protect children from online violence and
help access services when needed. Increased knowledge and skills of children,
families, and communities to help children safely use the internet and access services if
they are fall victim to online violence.
2) Children benefit from key services that help them stay safe online and respond to
the needs of survivors. Evidence will be used to integrate knowledge and skills on
children’s online safety into existing capacity building efforts of key service providers.
3) The Information and Communication Technology (ICT) industry implements standards
and measures to prevent and address online violence. Advocacy with ICT actors, such
as Vodacom, MTN, and Telkom, for endorsement and implementation of the Guidelines
for Industry on Child Online Protection.
4) National authorities and civil society (CS) have greater knowledge and
commitment to address online safety. Strengthening the understanding and
obligation of national authorities and civil society to address children’s online safety.
The following dashboard shows the level of success against the different criteria (See Table 4). This is
according to the four pillars (subsystems) that the programme targeted (see Table 1 for the activities and
specific stakeholders targeted, and Table 2 for the planned outputs and outcomes).

7.2 Progress towards results
To what extent were outputs achieved within the timeline relative to
the activities scheduled?
1) To what extent did the progress of the outputs contribute to programme implementation?
2) To what extent was output monitoring contributing to learning about the system?
7.2.1 Outputs
The achievement of output targets for each of the four pillars was based on the 31 December 2022 funding
report. The intended output targets were reached and often exceeded. However, the reported achievements
could not be verified as there was no central database capturing the reach, the sources were from different
subsystems (departments and organizations), and the nature of the spread for online awareness is
complex. The absence of a central, formal M&E system and database affected the programme's ability to
reflect and learn about, and within, the system. Activities were somewhat delayed due to the influence of
Covid-19 regulations and two no-cost extensions were granted till 31 December 2022.

The number of children who were provided with information about the online reporting
mechanism (10 million+) far exceeded the target of 300,000. They were reached through the online
interventions of UNICEF, DBE, GIZ, and the FPB. Reaching large numbers of children through online
channels is feasible, although capturing and verifying absolute numbers is difficult. The formula that was
used to determine the reach was not formalized, but an effort was made to capture data. It was stated as
cumulative numbers of the following1:
1 Personal communication S Moruane 15/03/22
47
• Intervention programmes with caregivers of children.
• Webinar with children included as participants.
• TV channels (SABC, Newzroom Afrika, and ENCA) where the Representative, Deputy Representative,
Chief, and Programme officer shared information about online violence. SABC has a listenership and
viewership of over 20 million people.
• Radio stations in the country catering to various community languages.
• Child Radio Foundation.
• Actual Presentations at child gathering platforms like Child Protection Week, Children’s Parliament,
and National Children’s Day.
• Platforms such as GovChat and U-Report for online sharing.
The number of children who received information about online safety (1.2 million) also exceeded the
target number (300,000). This is smaller than the previous target due to the intensity of this intervention
and the greater volume of information that was shared. The children were reached through multiple
platforms, including televised webinars, Facebook, TikTok, and Twitter. Without collaboration from the
service providers, it is not clear how the reach was captured. Although the numbers could not be verified,
these numbers are reasonable estimates due to the activities and platforms reaching large numbers of
children. Duplication in the counting of children using more than one platform likely occurred.
Parental awareness was achieved by integrating a parent and teen training manual with the online module
of the Sinovuyo parenting programme. Three programmes were completed, surpassing the target of
conducting two. The programmes targeted Training of Trainers but, whilst the rollout of the training to
parents is slowly gaining momentum, it did not reach critical mass at the time of the evaluation. An excellent
toolkit was developed and DSD has incorporated the information into the development of a programme
addressing child sexual exploitation as well as online and offline abuse.
The target for community awareness was set at 15 initiatives and this was achieved. The reported
initiatives included the training of 45 FBO representatives (religious leaders). Additional rollout to more
communities via structures beyond FBO is needed in future.
To achieve the targets set for the individual, family, and community levels, several initiatives were
completed. This included the development of quality materials and tools used by various partners, such as
social mobilization tools, and modules for the training of parents (integrated into the Sinovuyo parenting
programme). Training of communities focused on FBO and religious leaders reported the following:
• The most important learnings involved basic child rights and child protection factors, such as the law
and the Children’s Act. They learned about the risks, dangers, and consequences of social media.
• Those who reported having employed the training did not include any COS issues, but rather broad CP
matters.
• Many of the respondents (30%) said the solution to alleviate COS would be to remove internet access,
while a further 30% would choose to ignore the issue.
• Most respondents (66%) indicated that they shared the information with family and friends, 30% shared
with church members, just one person shared the information with a child, and one other shared with
a community member.
• They suggested the groups who need the information most were parents (50%), teachers (22%), and
community members (22%).
• The most vulnerable groups they identified included those between 8 and 15 years of age and those
with access to social media.
Imparting knowledge to children was limited to creating awareness and using more passive approaches,
such as online platforms. Active strategies, such as dialogues and peer-to-peer discussions, were used by
implementing partners (Media Monitoring Africa and AGAPE Youth Movement) and were more practical for
skills development (rather than just information transfer). More consideration should be given to these
channels in future rather than relying solely on parties in close contact with children, such as parents,
48
community members, educators, and social service workers. Activities that did not materialise included
meetings with corporates to enhance their commitment to COS.

Educator knowledge was addressed by developing materials to be included in school safety training for
educators. The training incorporated 203 educators from two districts in the Eastern Cape. Capturing
lessons learned from these events would improve the rollout of the training to other districts and provinces.
The commitment of the Department of Basic Education is high. Restrictions on in-person schooling due to
Covid-19 were addressed by the DBE as they recognised the opportunity offered by online learning. The
department took stock of the access challenges for all children (especially connectivity of the most
disadvantaged learners) while paying close attention to the online safety of learners. The department
developed structures and processes to ensure learners are aware of risks, such as adapting the School
Safety Framework and the e-safety in schools policy. The materials developed by UNICEF’s programme
contributed to these efforts.
The online survey with educators from the Eastern Cape who took part in training revealed the following:
• The most important topic they learned about was the risks and dangers of social media and
cyberbullying.
• The way they applied the knowledge related to incidence awareness and being able to increase
understanding among learners. One mentioned she could develop a practical strategy for the school
while another mediated an incident of online abuse.
• Their response behaviour changed in that they would ordinarily have disciplined the learner or restricted
their internet access.
• The trainees mostly shared the learning with colleagues, school management teams, and school
governing bodies. Two of them shared the information with children.
• They believed parents, caregivers, educators, and school management were the groups most in need
of the information.
• They disagreed on a specific vulnerable group (age groups ranged from younger than 12 years old to
12-18, 13-17, and 10-18-year-olds). They also raised the topic of girls and perpetrators.
49
• They felt the most important steps were awareness campaigns for children (27%) and sharing
knowledge (15%). They recommended advertisements on social media and television.
• Sharing information should extend beyond life orientation educators and should be monitored. They
stated parents should have access to children’s phones and that the ICT industry should block specific
applications and content.
234 social service professionals were trained, exceeding the target of 200. High-quality teaching
materials were developed and the training was endorsed and available on the DSD online platform. It was
accredited for Continued Professional Development (CPD) points by the professional board and there was
a good uptake by social service workers. The online survey conducted with the trained social service
workers revealed the following:
• The most important outcomes of the training were the awareness of their role in the protection and
support of children and the importance of communication (especially between caregivers and their
children).
• Most of the social service workers reported they disseminated what they had learned to parents and
caregivers (29%). One reported that he specifically addressed the safety of adults themselves. Three
mentioned specific actions they took based on their new understanding.
• The majority (50%) indicated they would have ignored online abuse before the training, 25%
acknowledged they would discipline the perpetrator, and 25% would block internet access.
• The main groups that they distributed the information to were colleagues (37%), parents and caregivers
(16%), family members, friends, and educators (11% each). One shared it with her child and another
one with a non-family child.
• The groups in greatest need of the information, according to the social service workers, were educators
(50%) and parents (22%).
• The most vulnerable group was “all children with internet access”.
• Similar to the educators they felt that more public awareness is needed.
• Suggestions for improving COS covered practicalities, such as improving reporting facilities (including
an online application) and more regular, practical, in-person training. They also suggested holding
discussion and support groups at schools and capacitating NGOs.
Materials to increase awareness amongst the police and justice sectors were developed. Unfortunately,
no training was established at the time of this evaluation due to the Covid-19 restrictions and the uprising
in the KwaZulu Natal (KZN) province in 2021. A handbook was developed and was in the process of
finalization at the time of the evaluation. The lack of training leaves a gap in a crucial subsystem of law and
order and needs more effort to secure commitment from the key role players. Interviewees from the sector
were not willing to participate in the evaluation.

The UNICEF COS programme planned to conduct advocacy with corporate entities, such as Vodacom,
MTN, and Telkom, seeking the endorsement and implementation of the Guidelines for Industry on Child
Online Protection and to follow up on those issued by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).
The consultation did not take place and the guidelines were not endorsed as planned. The only engagement
with the industry was as research participants for the Disrupting Harm study. Although valuable information
was obtained, no relationships or firm commitments were, as yet, developed.
According to the Programme Manager, no direct engagement transpired with the industry at this point of
the programme2. Achievements reported towards mechanisms to safeguard children cannot be directly
attributed to the UNICEF COS Programme. Media Monitoring Africa turned out to be a valuable partner and
it would be beneficial to work with the organisation to improve commitment and outcomes within the ICT
Industry. It is also critical to build effective partnerships with Google SA and Facebook.

The most significant contribution of the UNICEF COS programme was the Disrupting Harm study completed
by UNISA. This research provided a priceless, in-depth understanding of COS issues from the perspectives
of children, parents, and industry to aid the country's efforts. It also contributed internationally as part of the
Global We Protect Alliance and the value of this research should not be underestimated. Unfortunately,
dissemination of the findings and impact on policies could not be realised at the time due to delays in the
launch of the report. The national launch has been held up due to the processes for acceptance and global
launch by UNICEF and other international role players.
The development of a Model National Response (MNR) is dependent on this report. Each subsystem needs
to understand the challenges the specific sector faces in addressing COS. However, every stakeholder
2 Personal communication S Moruane 15/03/22
51
group also needs to understand the overarching issues and specifics for each sector. The document is
therefore critical for contributing to multiple action plans as well as developing a national response.
The programme reported that there is a commitment from South Africa to sign the Global We Protect
Alliance and to develop a Model National Response (MNR). However, this stems from DSD and not from
all stakeholder groups. DSD, DBE, and FPB have taken leading roles but are working in isolation and the
current silence of other partners needs to be addressed. There were also accounts of changes to legislation
to strengthen protection from online violence, harm, and abuse. UNICEF reports that seven reforms were
made covering the National Strategic Plan (NSP), Film and Publications Act, Domestic Violence Act, Sexual
Offence and Related Matters Act, Criminal Procedure Act amendment (led by Justice Department), National
Emergency Response Plan, and Cyber Crime Bill signed by the President in September 2021. This is a
lengthy process and may take some time before the amends are included. The Law Reform Commission
(LRC) completed a study to this effect but the results were not publicly available at this stage and the
process is therefore ongoing. These reforms cannot be attributed to UNICEF’s COS programme or
information gained through the Disrupting Harm study as the report has not yet been launched.
UNICEF referred to an “Interim Steering Committee embracing online safety for both women and children”.
It is unclear whether the interim steering committee applies to VAC and Child Protection (CP) in general or
COS. It is also uncertain if it refers to a government-led structure versus a system structure that includes
all stakeholders. The evaluation found that there is no national coordinated mechanism specifically for COS.
Although COS falls within the mandate and activities of the CP system, it needs a dedicated task team to
coordinate across subsystems as each one uses individual mechanisms (School Safety in DBE and Child
Protection in DSD, for example). COS needs a dedicated steering committee rather than being seen as
merely a subtask of CP.
Although UNICEF stated that the “revised Integrated Programme of Action Addressing Violence Against
Women and Children effectively addresses online violence against children”, this achievement refers to
online access to protection orders rather than COS directly.
7.2.2 Outcomes
To what extent were outcomes achieved relative to the activities
schedule within the timeline?
1) To what extent did the outcomes progress contribute to programme implementation?
2) To what extent did outcomes monitoring contribute to learning about the system?
This evaluation focused on system transformation rather than determining the actualisation of impact and
its longer-term outcomes as these rely on reaching a critical level of system transformation first. However,
a short discussion follows on findings related to the envisaged effects of the programme.
Individual, family, and community
The anticipated outcomes at the individual, family, and community levels are related to the prevention of
abuse and violence (through knowledge), and support by caregivers. The programme outcome target of
improving the knowledge of participants (70%) likely reflects only awareness. Knowledge levels could not
be measured as no pre-and-post-test monitoring tool was developed or used so it remains unclear how the
change in understanding could be estimated. Improving knowledge levels requires more than awareness
activities and should include behaviour change as an ultimate goal.

The results will depend on the realisation of other factors in the system and will need time to take effect and
then be measured. The M&E proposal included pre-post intervention measures that incorporated a follow-
up study by UNISA. This study should be launched when more system changes are evident and able to
affect outcomes.
The main result of activities at the individual level was increased awareness. This was not sufficient to bring
about change in protection from online violations or seeking treatment when violations occurred. Parents
and caregiver training will only be enacted once the ToT gains momentum. Training of communities centred
on religious leaders only so a much wider level of community engagement and training is needed. These
structures should include other networks beyond FBO, such as traditional and local leaders, Community
Based-Organizations (CBO), and informal associations. More relevant interventions, such as peer-to-peer
dialogues and group discussions, are needed to engage children. Children will need more than online
platform awareness and will benefit from further training to develop the skills needed to be vigilant,
protected, and able to seek help.
Service level
The goal of the service level interventions was for children to be better protected and assisted by more
knowledgeable service providers. It can be assumed that the knowledge of trained service providers would
increase but this may not translate into behavioural change and an improvement in the services offered.
Knowledge is only a first step toward behavioural change, and indicators need to be adjusted to reflect this.
Currently, they only assess knowledge levels directly after the training events. Training pre-and-post-test
tools were not developed and therefore no pre-testing was done to compare current or future knowledge
levels. The indicator for capacity development needs revision as it currently reflects outputs.

The online surveys with social service workers and educators provided insight into the integration of
learning for the trainees. The aim of the survey was not to test knowledge but to consider the application of
learning. The results indicated that the training increased awareness but did not have the same impact on
real knowledge transfer or behaviour change. The application of the knowledge remained low as most
participants could not describe events of COS. There were however higher levels of recognition of unsafe
53
situations in a personal capacity. Social service workers and educators related more incidences at home,
or in their private lives than in their professional capacity.
It is important to recognize that the resulting increase in awareness is very important and already
contributes to changes in the system, but more work would be needed before service providers would be
capable of reacting to incidents of online violence. Face-to-face training would offer a better environment
to practically apply knowledge but this was not possible due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Industry level
There were no outcomes or impacts on the ICT industry that can be attributed to the UNICEF COS
programme. Media Monitoring Africa carried out work in the industry, but this is not directly aligned with the
outcome indicators. It is critical to involve the ICT industry in the next phase of the programme. Indicators
would need to relate to changes within the industry, especially in its gatekeeping responsibility, rather than
merely reflecting knowledge levels.

UNICEF programme reports indicated that three key policies were adjusted, though the changes in these

awareness and knowledge levels of government and CS staff) are further described and addressed in the
next section of the report (Section 8).
The commitment of certain government departments and key individuals was exceptional. These include
DSD, DBE, and FPB. Some departments did not participate in this phase of the UNICEF programme but
their commitment will be critical for building and strengthening the COS system. These include DHA, DCDT
DOJ, NPA, and SAPS.
Civil society representatives were not prominent in any engagements, though some indicated they
participated in training events or meetings where UNICEF was present. More effort and strategic
interventions are needed to include CS to a larger extent and leverage their strengths.
54
7.2.3 Impact
The evaluation did not include measurement of any impact as decided during the inception phase (based
on the early stages of system change). Changes to the protection and treatment of children, reporting of
cases by the ICT industry, and investigations and prosecutions could not be achieved within a short
timeframe as this kind of impact depends on substantial system change. However, an attempt is made to
capture some positive and negative influences of the programme on the systems level.

7.3 Relevance
To what extent do the programme intervention objectives and design
respond to the needs, policies, and priorities of beneficiaries and
partner institutions? And how will they continue to do so if
circumstances change?
1) To what extent were different interventions relevant to improving online safety
through system transformation?
2) As a result of system transformation, to what extent were different interventions
relevant to improving children's access to services when needed?
3) Which interventions were the most, or least, relevant and which interventions should
have been included to address whole system change?
The engagements with key informants, online surveys with trainees, and the documents reviewed
(programme, legislation, policies, and literature) reiterated that this programme was both needed and
timely. The Covid-19 pandemic stressed the importance of internet connectivity and an online presence.
The pandemic also prioritized and accelerated activities, such as the DBE's school safety efforts, for
safeguarding children.
The programme's design and its goal to strengthen the system were relevant, and they remain so.
Identifying the four key pillars or subsystems showed the programme's ability to prioritize the most important
groups for ensuring system transformation. In doing so, it focused on more than just the needs of specific
beneficiaries and partners by highlighting the national situation and the need for system transformation to
allow access for children while keeping them safe.
Whilst the interventions were relevant, they were not all executed at the same level. The most critical
intervention was the production of evidence and a description of the online environment. The programme
worked towards making significant contributions to legal reforms through the Disrupting Harm study (done
by the BMR at UNISA). The study not only investigated the situation as expressed by children, parents, and
other role players, but will continue to be instrumental in providing background information for the system
and its multiple subsystems.
The pillar focusing on the ICT industry received less attention and few activities were completed. This critical
subsystem needs more priority in the next phase of the programme as the industry holds responsibility for
regulation. The pertinent aspect of training the law enforcement and prosecution sector also lagged. Other
training materials and activities will provide a foundation to support the rollout to stakeholder groups not yet
reached. Training for SAPS, COJ, and NPA needs to be prioritized.
56
Are the objectives and design of the interventions sensitive to the
economic, environmental, child rights, gender, equity, social, political
economy, and capacity conditions in which they take place?
1) To what extent did the programme design and interventions consider the context of
South Africa (Political, Economic, Social, Technology, Environmental and Legal)?
2) To what extent did the programme design and interventions include equality? Were
the most marginalized included in the programme in a manner that enhanced their
contributions using methods appropriate to their level of understanding and
participation?
3) To what extent did the programme design and interventions include gender?
4) To what extent did the programme design and intervention activities contribute to the
promotion of children's rights?
5) To what extent did the programme take into consideration the capacity of role-
players in South Africa? Were all relevant stakeholders included in the online child
safety system?
This programme is particularly needed in South Africa. The country's progressive legislation includes
The Domestic Violence Act, 1998; The National Council Against Gender-Based Violence (NCAGBV); The
Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007 (Act No. 32 of 2007);
The Children’s Act, 2005 and Children’s Amendment Act, 2007; The Women Empowerment and Gender
Equality Bill; The National Action Plan; and the Prevention and Combating of Trafficking in Persons. These
will need continued reforms to incorporate COS, and the generation of information (Disrupting Harm study)
was a critical step towards this. Political will was addressed during this phase of the study, providing a
foundation for other commitments, structuring a national coordinating mechanism, and developing and
implementing a sophisticated MNR using the research results and knowledge generated.
Technological and economic factors play a large role in internet access. The programme's focus was on
risk identification and prevention but it is also important to consider the right to access. This does not imply
a programme responsibility to provide access, but rather the uniqueness of the COS system should be
considered when implementing generic VAC strategies that might not be relevant. Internet access facilitates
many development rights, as highlighted by the education effort during the Covid-19 pandemic. COS
programmes need to consider the balance of access and protection. The Disrupting Harm study and efforts
by other system stakeholders provided information on this. UNICEF is in an excellent position to share this
knowledge and guide advocacy for access. Children’s rights concerning child protection were addressed
but more work is needed on access. This is not entirely the responsibility of the programme, but the system
and the knowledge generated are factors that could play a critical role when national access for all children
is discussed.
Not all role players were included in this initial phase of the programme, with the focus being the inclusion
of the most critical stakeholders (individuals, government, and service providers). Participation of some
stakeholder groups was intended but not achieved (SAPS, DOJ, DCDT, and ICT industry) and others were
not targeted but should be included in further interventions (DHA, civil society).
7.3.1 Equity and gender responsiveness
Gender, equity, and other power relations were not directly addressed in the programme. There was a lack
of specific actionable points and reporting results (e.g., no disaggregation of data) to address inequalities.
However, this is less critical compared to other evaluations because the programme assumes the same
57
level of vulnerability applies to children online and that access is the determining factor. Both girls and boys
in Low- and Middle-Income Countries are equally affected by the availability of internet access and the cost
of data. This negated the need to identify or target the most vulnerable groups. There was no consensus
amongst respondents to the online survey and KII as to who they consider more vulnerable. For some, it
included specific age group ranges and, for others, it was socioeconomic status. The UNICEF programme
aimed to strengthen the system through strategic stakeholders instead of targeting specific vulnerable
groups. Inequalities, online vulnerabilities, and gender differences will become clearer as the work
progresses, service providers capture data on violations, and more research is conducted.
As mentioned above, the programme focused on the larger system and its place in the CP sphere. In
subsequent stages, the socio-economic aspects of access and how they affect the system will need to be
addressed. There also needs to be deliberate steps to identify and include the most vulnerable groups.
7.4 Coherence
Coherence addresses how well the intervention fits globally, nationally, and within and between other
systems. This links to aspects of system dynamics and transformation. Some questions on coherence are
addressed in the section on system changes (Section 8).
To what extent are the programme's interventions contributing to the
global safeguarding of children online? How is this linked to achieving
SDGs?
1) To what extent did the programme contribute to the global online child protection
system?
This programme is part of the ‘We Protect Programme’ of the Global Partnership to End Violence Alliance.
The programme contributed information through the universal Disrupting Harm research study and is
aligned with the Global Partnership goals. The programme’s global value was high, contributing to both the
alliance and the SDGs, and addressed the following targets:
• Target 16.2 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) calls on all countries to “end abuse,
exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against, and torture of, children” by 2030
• Target 5.2 (the elimination of all forms of violence against women and girls)
• Target 8.7 (eradicate child labour and human trafficking)
What could be done to improve coherence and interlinkages with
relevant national norms, standards, priorities, and policies, including
child rights, equity, and gender equality?
1) To what extent did the programme influence national norms, standards, priorities,
and policies regarding online child safety?
2) To what extent did the programme interventions influence national efforts on gender
equality, equity, and child rights? What can be done to improve the influence?
58
The programme reacted to national priorities and contributed in two ways:
Firstly, through the programme design, it became clear that the issue of online safety of children can only
be addressed systemically. The programme strategy focused on four pillars, or levels, including the
individual (children, caregivers, and community members), service providers (education, social services,
and law enforcement), ICT industry, and national structures (government and civil society). The programme
was instrumental in establishing the structure of the system and, although not all pillars were addressed
equally, it made significant progress in positioning it within other important CP systems, both nationally and
within UNICEF structures. Progress has been made in alleviating silo thinking and enhancing collaboration
between subsystems.
Secondly, through the research and results from the Disrupting Harm study, the programme generated
information essential for all work on COS in South Africa. It also contributed to knowledge and
understanding of different contexts internationally.
Children’s rights to protection were addressed directly as the main target of the programme. Their rights to
access were not addressed but the programme design, structure, and information generation contribute to
this aspect. Gender equality and equity were not addressed directly in the programme, as described in the
previous section (7.4 Relevance).
7.5 Effectiveness
The implementation of the programme activities and results (outputs, outcomes, and impact) visible at this
early stage of system development and transformation was described in detail in Section 7.2. This section
will answer the main overarching questions regarding the ultimate effectiveness of the programme.
To what extent were the programme's interventions achieved
regarding its objectives and results, including any differential effects
across groups, factoring in gender and national equity
considerations?
1) To what extent was individual level capacity improved so that children, families, and
communities protect children from online abuse?
2) To what extent did the programme strengthen key service providers that help keep
children safe online and respond to their needs as survivors of abuse?
3) To what extent is the ICT industry implementing standards and measures that
prevent online violence?
4) To what extent did the national authorities and civil society structures increase
knowledge and commitment to addressing online safety?
5) To what extent was the programme's aim of strengthening the system to ensure
children are safe online and can access services achieved?
6) Were there any differences in effects for different groups?
The best result was the capacity development of service providers (although training of SAPS and DOJ did
not take place), while the ICT industry showed the fewest achievements. Knowledge transfer was mostly
only limited to awareness.
59
At the individual level, achievements were related to the development of materials for training. General
awareness amongst children and, to a lesser extent, parents and caregivers was achieved. Transferring
knowledge was limited to widespread awareness on social media for children. Parent training hadn't taken
place but Training-of-Trainers was completed and the incorporation of modules into the Sinovuyo parenting
programme contributed greatly. Communities were reached through the training of religious leaders
(representatives of FBO). This community group was important but of limited influence and it would be
worthwhile to include other community structures, such as CBOs, and traditional and local leaders, to reach
communities effectively and to scale.
Service providers were trained in the education and social development sectors. The uptake of the training
was good, and the materials developed were of high quality. Application of the knowledge was not yet
evident, but identification and referral of cases had begun taking place. Relationships with SAPS and DOJ
need attention to yield results.
Additionally, the ICT industry was not included directly. This is a gap in the programme and
recommendations include working directly with the industry as well as through an implementing partner
(e.g., Media Monitoring Africa) to enhance this pillar of the system. The industry needs to protect children
and their efforts will have a tremendous impact due to their platforms and the young digital population.
National authorities were mostly committed and involved in the programme, particularly key government
departments such as DSD, DBE and FPB. Other departments whose commitment is needed include DCDT,
DHA, DOJ, SAPS, and NPA. The main challenge was that a system-based approach and thinking were
lacking, resulting in work silos. Awareness of the system approach is needed and UNICEF holds an
important role there. The lack of activity coordination and the duplication of efforts to reach children in
different spaces demonstrates the need for a national coordinating structure dedicated to COS.
Civil society (CS) played a minor role in the programme. Some organizations were represented at training
events by individuals, some reported attending meetings (with UNICEF as a participant and not a facilitator),
and some were involved in training and other interventions (Agape Youth Movement). There were no
minutes of meetings available to the consultant for further investigation into CS involvement.
The most significant gap in the system was the lack of a central and national COS mechanism or steering
committee to lead the system. Various government departments have national instruments in place, but
there is no central coordinating structure dedicated to the online safety of children. A work session should
be held with all subsystems present, data from the Disrupting Harm study shared, a central national steering
mechanism formed (with representation from all subsystems), and the Model National Response developed
as a collective. This will further ensure buy-in from all stakeholders.
The programme was more effective in addressing online safety than providing access. However, in the next
stage of the programme, the structural system changes and intended strengthening of the ICT industry
subsystem will provide the opportunity and mechanism to lead advocacy for access. The information and
pathways created through the programme will provide leverage and enable these efforts.
What were the significant factors influencing the achievement or non-
achievement of the objectives and programme outputs and outcomes?
1) Which factors influenced the achievement of programme objectives, outcomes, and
outputs?
2) Which factors hindered the achievement of programme objectives, outcomes, and
outputs?
60
The results were system-based and some groups were affected differently due to non-participation (either
through programme constraints in execution or their planned inclusion in the next phase). See Sections
7.2.4 and 7.2.5 for lists of those activities and which stakeholders were not yet affected. Recommendations
for ensuring the inclusion of certain groups follow in Section 10.
Some factors that hindered the achievement of results include the following:
• The main obstacles were the Covid-19 restrictions, which negatively affected the timeframe of the
programme, delaying UNICEF activities as well as partner interventions and contributions. Events and
meetings were disrupted and postponed. The change to online meetings affected the participation of
stakeholders due to technical issues and an initial lack of computer proficiency. The pandemic also
impacted health, mental wellness, and productivity. The lack of travel and in-person meetings further
influenced the awareness and understanding of the system development. Having one face-to-face
meeting with all stakeholders might have accelerated the uptake of the subsystems. Implementing
partners also had to restrict the number of participants in training events due to online modes of delivery
and some participants were excluded due to internet accessibility. The extension took place according
to prescribed procedures and did not have any budget implications.
• The lack of commitment from some stakeholder groups could be partially attributed to Covid-19
restrictions but is more likely due to the silo mentality that often persists in government departments.
The factors that enhanced and enabled the achievement of results were:
• The flexibility of consultants and programme partners to deliver products of high quality. Implementing
partners had to adjust to different modes of training delivery and holding meetings, which required
additional effort and time.
• The consultants who conducted the research (BMR at UNISA, Prof Tustin, and Dr Basson) had to
adjust the methodology and were able to deliver a high-quality report that is valid, reliable, and
trustworthy.
• Mr Burton, who developed materials, had to adjust the mode of delivery and the curriculum. For
example, educators were trained remotely, and the SAPS training module was adjusted to incorporate
into the existing training curriculum.
• The fact that the programme was designed with the aim to strengthen the system and used a system
approach also alleviated some challenges:
• The burden was distributed throughout the system and the effect of a crisis (such as Covid-19) did
not influence all aspects of programme delivery.
• The aim of the programme was not a direct intervention with a single group, but rather to strengthen
parts of the system for broader delivery.
Were there any significant differential results by gender and
subgroups, and what were the causes of these?
1) 26. To what extent did the programme interventions show different results for
groups, including gender?
The programme did not include gender or other subgroups as the focus was system development and
transformation. However, information from the Disrupting Harm study made significant contributions to
understanding the subgroups at risk of online violence, including gender.
61
7.6 Efficiency
To what extent did the intervention deliver the planned results in a
cost-effective and timely manner? Were resources used strategically,
and was adequate value achieved as a result of the final investment?
1) To what extent have resources been used strategically and cost-effectively?
Value-for-money could not be determined as financial information with breakdowns for different activities
was not available. No analysis or conclusions on itemized spending and efficiency of budgets per
subsystem were therefore possible. The assumption was that the financial processes were in place and
followed for reassigning the budget to other activities.
What were the major factors that supported or impeded the delivery of
programme results?
1) What were the major factors that enhanced and limited the delivery of programme
activities in a timely and cost-effective manner?
Considering the activities and relevant outputs, the deliverables were provided in a cost-effective and timely
manner. Optimal use was made of partner skills and assistance and UNICEF did not overcommit resources.
One recommendation would be to have a dedicated staff member at the Country Office focusing on COS.
It is reasonable to assume that COS falls within the Child Protection sphere (and would be managed as
part of the larger unit), but more dedicated attention is needed to facilitate the system development and
transformation. This will ensure that the COS programme is prioritized and not merely seen as an add-on
to other Child Protection programmes.
The main impact on the programme delivery time was the Covid-19 regulations, including the hard
lockdown, travel restrictions, and the effects of being unable to hold face-to-face training or larger meetings.
Section 7.5 discusses this in more detail. The extension did not incur additional costs and efforts were made
to ensure the time was used effectively. The flexibility of consultants to develop materials and adjust
research methodologies allowed the completion of deliverables on time and to the same standard.
The systemic approach to addressing COS was the most appropriate for strengthening the ability of role-
players (and subsystems) and achieving overall commitment and momentum. The way Covid-19
challenges were handled within the system is testimony to the value of this approach. Other direct
interventions would be more costly, take longer to implement, and be less sustainable.
Were the chosen strategies and approaches the most cost-effective
and efficient? Were there alternatives that could have worked better,
and, if so, what were those?
1) To what extent were alternative strategies and approaches considered and
implemented to ensure efficiency while maintaining quality?

7.7 Sustainability
The sustainability of the intervention's results ranged from high for the national level (government), low
for the individual and service provision levels, and non-existent for the ICT industry component.
The sustainability of delivery results is linked to system transformation and is higher than that of the
individual activity results.
To what extent are the net benefits of the programme's interventions
likely to continue based on the institutional capacities and
instruments produced through the programme?
1) To what extent are system changes and transformation permanent, and to what
extent will the changes in subsystems enable continued transformation?
2) To what extent did national level interventions change to allow continued system
enhancement? Are these changes implementable?
3) To what extent are new knowledge and skills integrated into the regular activities of
professionals working with children?
4) To what extent will the ICT industry comply with new standards, and how will this
complement or hinder continued system changes?
Sustainability of results achieved
The sustainability of results at the national level (government only) was high due to the structures and
processes already present (and were used during this programme), especially related to general Child
Protection (CP) programmes. The following national-level interventions and changes contributed to
sustainability:
• The influence of knowledge creation from the programme (the UNISA Disrupting Harm
study). This knowledge is crucial for understanding the impact of online violence and abuse, and
identification of leverage points in the system that can address these factors. The knowledge created
is applicable throughout the system and essential to the development of the MNR.
• The materials developed for the capacity development efforts in the different subsystems. Not
only are the end products sustainable, but the process and expertise of the developer will ensure that
these tools and modules can be adjusted and used in other subsystems, both existing and new.
• Legal reforms will continue and these long-lasting effects will ensure the sustainability of
system interventions. It takes a longer time to be effective, but the change has greater longevity.
• The commitment of key departments in National Government was a critical step in the
development of the system. There are passionate and dedicated individuals who are driving system
transformation. They were critical to this phase of the system development, but their efforts will still
have an impact even if they are not personally involved after the development phase. This contrasts
with programmes where interventions target specific beneficiaries. In these instances, the loss of a
driven individual and champion is often devastating to the programme. In a dynamic system, the drive
and passion are transferrable, and the effect remains in the system as a legacy.
The value of the knowledge created (through the Disrupting Harm study and the development of materials)
has been highlighted throughout this report. This made a significant improvement to the system and
sustainability of the programme and system, even without continued programme interventions. Managing
the dissemination and use of the knowledge will be an important next step to ensuring the sustainability of
the knowledge generated.
63
Results from the training of service providers are low. The training of social service workers comprised a
module added to online training for CPD. The real impact of the training towards behaviour change, and
ultimately assisting children, depends on additional teaching. The educator training took place in only two
districts of the Eastern Cape and this kind of limited coverage will not lead to rollout in other districts or
provinces. From the online surveys, it was clear that the practical application of the training was not yet
evident. The same effect was apparent with the limited numbers of religious leaders trained, particularly as
FBO formed the only group representing the community.
Working with the ICT industry is important for the system to strengthen gatekeeper functions and the lack
of interventions in this subsystem is the main weakness of the programme at present.
Sustainability of the system changes
The sustainability of the system is high due to the programme’s influence on system strengthening and
continuity. It is more likely that changes in the system and subsystems will persist as opposed to
interventions like training events.
If one part of the system (a stakeholder or champion) is critically affected, the system is more likely to
recover as the overall integrity remains stable. The system transformation achieved so far is not fixed and
final but will evolve and develop through time and in response to technological and other changes in the
South African environment.
What factors could improve the programme's sustainability if it were
to be expanded or replicated to maintain net benefits over time?
1) Which factors have been identified by different subsystems that can be replicated to
enhance sustainability across multiple subsystems?
The most important factor for sustainability is not having a fixed intervention that is stable and efficient, but
rather a system that is dynamic and able to adjust to changes in the environment, the system, and
subsystems. Although the programme targeted system strengthening, there were factors identified that can
be replicated for use by specific stakeholder groups. For example, the adjustment and revision of materials
and the process of training module accreditation (e.g., CYCW training).
This programme only began to affect system changes and addressed the foundational aspects. Four pillars,
or subsystems, were used and others will need to be included to address the needs of children and protect
them from online risks. The required structural changes to the system to ensure sustainability include the
following:
• Adding additional subsystems. At present law enforcement and prosecution sectors need to be
included and committed. This includes SAPS, NPA, and DOJ.
• The ICT industry will need to play a key role.
• It is anticipated that other subsystems requiring inclusion will become clearer as the system is
strengthened. This could include the Department of Health (DOH) and other community structures.
• Further developments in each subsystem will be identified and addressed as the system transforms.
Most of the current sustainability lies within the broader system. The next phase of the programme should
expand the interventions within and between subsystems, adjust activities and interventions that were
incomplete, and cascade interventions (e.g., training of educators in other provinces). The leverage points
in the system will ensure that children are reached and optimally affected. Section 8.3 outlines this.
64
8. SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION RESULTS
The real value of the UNICEF Programme lies in the advancements towards structural changes in the
system, early knowledge generation, and the commitment of key stakeholders. There are three important
functions of the Child Online Safety (COS) system:
1) Awareness of all role-players of the value and risks of COS
2) Contributions by subsystems, such as service provision and policy changes ,that enable the greater
system
3) Ultimately capacitating and protecting children.
This section presents the findings in describing the system, highlighting system changes, and identifying
leverage points that impact the online safety of children.
8.1 System description
It is important to describe the system structure to understand how it fits within the national CP system and
how it relates to other programmes. The system dynamics and the interrelatedness of the different
subsystems are important to effect transformation. This description will aid in understanding the system
transformation achieved, and planning further interventions for the continuation of the programme.
8.1.1 System structure - coherence and boundaries
To what extent are the programme's interventions synergistic with
national priorities and policies on safeguarding children online?
1) To what extent did the programme contribute to other relevant systems (online and
child protection systems) in South Africa?
The alignment of the programme and system with national priorities is described in Section 7.3. It is relevant
when describing the system structure in this section and highlighting how the COS fits into the CR and CP
systems. See Figure 8.
The COS system fits into the larger CP and child rights (CR) structures but is not fully embedded within the
CP system. The CP system aims to protect children and is fully contained within the CR system. However,
because the COS system goes beyond online safety and includes the rights of the child to internet access
and an online presence, part of it falls outside of the CP system. As such, it requires different solutions to
protect children.
65
Figure 8: Fit of COS system in larger systems
The COS system differs from other CP systems and interventions in that it does not aim to remove a risk
factor (access to the internet) but provides guidelines for navigating it safely. Caregivers and service
providers need to be equipped with a greater and wider scope of knowledge to go beyond removing or
avoiding the danger. For example, awareness is not merely pointing out possible dangers but requires a
careful reflection on boundaries and risk management by the child themself while using the internet. This
cannot be achieved by focusing on one aspect or one stakeholder group but needs wide system
transformation. It also does not see the child as the individual at-risk but considers and treats all children
as playing multiple, varied roles. For example, a child could be a victim, perpetrator, witness, or enabler.
Some children perpetuate the crime by recording it and this leads to secondary victimization of the enabler,
the witness, and the victim.
In planning transformation, it is important to understand the system and where it overlaps or embeds in
other larger systems. Strategic planning needs to consider the boundaries of what, and who, is part of the
system.
8.1.2 System dynamics - interrelatedness
The functioning and dynamics of the system are critical to understanding and using systems thinking. The
COS system aims to reduce risks while enhancing internet use. This dynamic is controlled by feedback
loops (negative and positive) that allow the system to adjust both the inflow of internet usage (and
perpetrators) and the outflow of risk (and victims). The main aspect to understand is the dynamic interaction
and interrelatedness of the subsystems.
The current system needs additional structures to be included. Figure 9 shows an adjusted system with
supplementary subsystems recommended for expanding the current programme as well as additional
government departments and community structures. It also further disaggregates civil society into those
66
organizations to be included as service providers in CP, advocacy partners, or implementing partners (e.g.,
for training and capacity development of children, caregivers, and community members).
Figure 9: Recommended expansion of COS system
Figure 10 illustrates how the system and its parts interact to enhance COS and represents the revised
systems-based ToC. The interventions aim to change the mechanism by changing environmental aspects
(political, economic, social, technology, environment, and legal) and the system itself. System changes
include awareness, knowledge, commitment, behaviour, processes, and services of all subsystems. This
transformed system will then be able to protect and respond to children, with the ultimate impact being child
safety and wellness.
Important aspects to consider when assessing or describing a system are the assumptions made about the
system and the environment (including risk and contributing factors). These assumptions need to be clearly
stated to ensure monitoring of the system, the contributing factors, and environmental influences. This
approach allows for capturing intended and unintended changes, as well as both positive and negative
changes. Regular review of the system (by all stakeholders) is needed for timely adjustments.
67
Figure 10: Theory of Change – systems-based
The next level of dynamics to consider is in and between subsystems. This is illustrated in Figure 11. The
parts (stakeholders and individuals) interact and influence each other within the subsystem and the
subsystems influence each other and the broader system. There is also the bidirectional influence of the
environment and the system (e.g., changes in legislation due to the system and shifts that influence it in
return). The goal of the system dynamics is to influence the ultimate goal of the system (that is the child
being safe online).
68
Figure 11: Interactions of parts, subsystems, systems, and context
The interrelatedness of the different subsystems is important to consider as understanding this reduces silo
thinking and working. It further limits duplication of effort and enables the identification and use of leverage
points. Understanding the system dynamics enables continuous monitoring, reflection, and adjustments to
interventions in different functions as the effect of a small adjustment to one area is easier to visualize. To
illustrate this further, an example of the dynamic interactions of the DSD subsystem is used. The following
are interactions between parts of the system:
• Influencing within a subsystem: Interventions with the Department of Social Development (DSD)
• Other parts of the subsystem: DSD will also influence the work of educators in the service provision
subsystem
• The DSD subsystem will have an influence and will be influenced by the larger COS system
• Other larger systems such as CP and CR will be influenced by the work done to protect children from
online harm
The environmental context (legislative, political, and socio-economic) will influence all system levels
(individual, service provision, industry, and national subsystems) and, conversely, the system will affect the
environment.
8.2 System changes
The UNICEF programme had a significant influence on the COS system and affected critical elements of
its structure. Considering the DAC criteria, and describing progress towards output and outcome results,
only provides a limited picture of the true value of the programme in system transformation.
69
To what extent did the intervention produce, or is expected to
produce, significant positive or negative, intended, or unintended
results?
1) To what extent are system changes and transformation visible? Which subsystems
were affected more, which were less affected, and what factors influenced this?
2) To what extent has system transformation influenced the online safety of children?
How can this be enhanced?
3) What unintended (positive and negative) effects were observed in the system? What
contributed to this? How will this be captured in future programmes?
The following changes were evident due to the UNICEF programme:
• The most fundamental change that happened in the system was the widespread awareness raised.
This not only included the ultimate target beneficiaries (children), but also those in close contact with
children (caregivers and community members), the service providers (educators, social service
workers), and national structures such as the government and civil society. This awareness-raising was
the first step toward the practical application of knowledge.
• Another vital step was the generation of knowledge of the system. The Disrupting Harm study is not
merely a product of the programme but provides information essential to understanding and
transforming the system to enable change for children. The influence and value of this knowledge were
not limited to a single or a few subsystems but influenced all levels and all subsystems. It holds value
for other systems, such as the CP and CR systems, in South Africa and globally. The delays in
disseminating the information and making the report public due to a hold in the international launch are
regrettable but not critical. This knowledge will be crucial for the next important, whole-system step in
developing an MNR and formalizing an overarching national COS mechanism.
• Subsystem changes in knowledge and actions (specifically in reaction to Covid-19 implications like
online education) were seen, especially in the service delivery and government spheres.
It might seem that not attending to awareness of the SAPS and not focusing on the ICT industry are
shortfalls in the programme implementation. However, system dynamics imply that small changes can have
major effects on other parts of the system. So far, the COS system has built a foundation of knowledge and
understanding of the core issue and the system structure. General awareness was raised to prepare the
system and subsystems. Awareness and information about the system structure and the environment within
which it functions were critical and had a huge influence.
A further point to note is that systems transformation is not a simple and linear process. Measuring progress
towards impact using individual indicators (such as those in the M&E logframe and what was captured by
the DAC criteria) might miss the essential changes in the system and focus on what seems like a lack of
impact. Results of efforts might seem insignificant at this stage when they actually have a significant and
long-lasting impact on the wider system.
The main system transformation that can be directly attributed to the UNICEF programme is the availability
of critical information, the level of awareness, and formalizing the structure of the system. Subsystem
changes were also visible, especially in parts of the service delivery pillar (educators and social service
workers) and in the work of some government departments (DSD, DBE, and FPB). The next steps will be
the wider dissemination and application of the knowledge, capacity development (knowledge and practical
skills) of all system components, and the formalization of a dedicated and representative coordinating body.
70
All components of the system played an important role and were affected by increased knowledge and
awareness. There were critical government departments included in the initial design that did not play a
role, such as DOJ and DCDT. Others, such as DHA, should be included and some might become more
important in the future, such as DOH. It will be important to ensure that civil society plays a larger role as
implementing partners, advocates, and service providers to children. Viewing CS as a separate subsystem
from the national government could highlight the role it needs to play. The identification and use of leverage
points to directly work with children is important to ensure the optimal effect.
Were there secondary or potential consequences of the programme's
interventions?
1) What consequences impacted other systems and the context?
The knowledge generated influenced not only efforts in South Africa but also the international COS efforts.
This is especially important as the research study methodology aligned with studies in other countries and
comparison and global action plans are therefore possible. These plans are even more critical for COS as
there are no national boundaries limiting perpetrator access to children. The information did and will play a
role in efforts in child protection more generally and for children’s rights.
The system changes to date were more structural and influenced awareness more than behaviour change.
However, there were reports by trainees of an ability to recognize rights violations and refer appropriately
(treatment and reporting perpetrators). The government subsystem implemented changes such as
incorporating COS in the School Safety programme and the DSD's inclusion of COS as a module in the
training curriculum. Attributing this solely to the UNICEF programme was not possible as many other factors
had an influence. The publicized suicides by learners after cyberbullying events played a major role in DSD
and DBE reactions and creating hot spots. These campaigns and events also motivated the subsystems to
work closer together.
To what extent were changes in systems, behaviours or norms
reached?
1) To what extent did the system changes influence the behaviour of individuals,
components, and subsystems?
8.3 Leverage points - capacitating and protecting children
The first step in transforming the COS system was to raise awareness and empower its various parts for
the protection of children and the delivery of services. However, these efforts cannot yet be seen as
influencing the behaviour of children directly. For example, working with parents and caregivers first raised
their awareness (they need to understand both the benefits and risks) and then guided them on how to
ensure their children are safe online (through guidance and monitoring of online behaviour). It is not a train-
the-trainer type of intervention where the parent will then transfer the knowledge to the child. Children are
in many cases more tech-savvy and able to access the internet from different devices. Although working
with service providers that interact directly with children, caregivers, and parents is important, this is not the
most efficient method of sharing information with children. None of these groups offers good leverage points
in the capacity development of children. This is not due to a lack of proximity to the child but to the nature
71
of online technology. The leverage points for the intervention are critical and, based on the interviews and
literature, it seems the best way children learn about online behaviour is through peer-to-peer dialogue.
The following touch points were proposed:
• The school space (not just the physical school grounds but any space where learning takes place) is
the most appropriate to reach children.
• Online platforms and communities are important touch points for general awareness but can also be
used for more in-depth knowledge transfer as well as monitoring of behaviour (systemic shifts and not
individual tracking).
• To reach more community members and increase general awareness, it is proposed that high-use
public spaces, particularly those where people spend time waiting (such as at health clinics, taxi ranks,
and shopping centres), are used along with broader media messages.
The leverage points should preferably be through children and not via intermediaries such as caregivers
or educators acting as trainers of children. These peer structures include:
• Representative Council of Learners (RCL) at schools. These are structures that are in place at all
schools and will enable more children to be reached.
• Civil society and NGOs that work with children in different activities, including sports and other online
training efforts.
• Development of games and applications (similar to applications already developed for reporting GBV).

9. CONCLUSIONS, GOOD PRACTICES AND
LESSONS LEARNED
9.1 Conclusions
The UNICEF programme to strengthen the online safety of children successfully created a foundation to
enable further system transformation (See Figure 12). Four pillars or levels were targeted, of which only
three were included in the programme activities. The ICT industry was not reached as intended. The
individual (children, caregivers, parents, and community), service providers (social service workers and
educators) and national structures (mainly government departments such as DSD, DBE and FPB) levels
were included. Civil Society was included to a lesser extent and SAPS and justice officials were not directly
reached. Activities were impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions and the outbreak of violence in
KZN. This foundational work included high-quality knowledge generation through the Disrupting Harm study
and the development of various materials and tools for training service providers. Widespread awareness
of COS issues was reported by the programme through training and awareness events with different
stakeholders. Some activities did not take place as per the programme proposal, especially those related
to law enforcement and justice officials and the ICT industry. A dedicated COS national steering body that
includes all stakeholders is needed. Although many different stakeholder groups (such as government
departments) were doing excellent work, this mainly happened in silos. The reaction to current critical
events (such as suicides after online abuse and victimization) by different departments (including DSD and
DBE) shows that combined efforts are possible and effective.
Figure 12: Summary of results
73
9.1.1 Progress towards output and outcome results
The outputs generally exceeded the targets for the programme. This is commendable but an M&E system
would enable verification of these reports. There was unfortunately no description or disaggregation
available for a large number of children which could resolve the groups reached through the different
methods. It will be critical to ensure that there is not only a large reach but also in-depth interventions. Peer-
to-peer dialogue seemed to be most effective. The capacity development of parents and caregivers will
only be effective once the roll-out from the trainers takes effect. Training of religious leaders raised
awareness but the influence on broader communities will be limited until other community representatives
are also included.
The training materials developed for different service providers (social service workers, educators, and
SAPS) were of high quality. The training of educators was limited to two districts in the Eastern Cape, and
replication of the training to other districts and provinces should be easy. The method to reach social service
workers through accredited online modules for CPD was effective and can also be replicated with other
social welfare personnel. SAPS and justice officials still need to be trained and it would be good to include
orientation of other service providers such as community-based workers, mental and health care workers,
NPA, and other service providers to children.
On a national level, the commitment was found to be high for some government departments (including
DSD, DBE, and FPB), while others would need stronger relationship-building activities and awareness of
system implications. The work of this important stakeholder group could also be enhanced through systems
thinking. A group that was not optimally involved in the programme but offers tremendous potential is civil
society. Some national child rights NGOs participated in training events but the contributions such as
advocacy work, service provision, and implementation of programme activities were not evident. This offers
a great opportunity to optimize the work done by the programme.
The outcomes were not realised at this stage of the programme as the intended results depend on further
strengthening of the system. Repeat measures such as a follow-up Disrupting Harm study will provide
information on targets reached for outcomes in the future.
The most significant contribution was the generation of knowledge for the system through the Disruptive
Harm research study and the development of a range of high-quality training materials and tools. Sharing
this information is the next step toward the development of a South African MNR.
9.1.2 DAC criteria and equity
The results of the DAC criteria varied between components and within the different pillars of the programme.
Due to the ICT industry component lagging in implementation it showed lower ratings for all segments but
its strategic influence remains highly relevant. There were differences between interventions, with
relevance and effectiveness being high and coherence and sustainability being low.
Relevance
The UNICEF COS programme was relevant to the time, needs, and situation in South Africa and contributed
to strengthening a system that will enhance the online safety of children. The design of the programme
included the four main pillars. The identified pillars remain relevant, with some components needing more
directed effort (ICT and service provision) and additional components needing to be included (additional
government departments and civil society). The programme was applicable to legislation reform and,
although the programme was reported to have impacted legal reforms, it will become more relevant once
the knowledge generated through the programme is disseminated more widely. The Disrupting Harm study
will have a significant impact on all components of the system in the planning and execution of child
protection measures.
74
Coherence
The programme’s knowledge generation contributed significantly to global efforts, such as the Global
Partnership to End Violence Alliance’s 'We Protect' Programme” and the SDG targets 5.2, 8.7, and 16.2.
The programme reacted to national priorities by working systemically and through the knowledge generated
locally toward the national effort. However, coherence within the system was low. The four different pillars
had no exchange and there was limited collaboration even within components of the programme.
Awareness of the systemic nature of the COS efforts should enhance relationships between different
stakeholders to work together for the greater good.
Effectiveness
The effectiveness of the programme, in general, was related to knowledge generation and transfer.
Awareness of COS was raised significantly at a system-wide level. More effort will be needed to roll out the
training to other stakeholders not yet included in the programme activities but the development of materials
will enhance this. Engagement of children requires innovative methods to reach them more appropriately
and ensure a depth of skills transfer. This includes peer-to-peer dialogue using existing leverage points,
such as RCL structures at schools and CBO events.
The effectiveness of the system will be enhanced through a dedicated and inclusive steering mechanism.
COS is currently prioritized as part of the CP system and therefore situated in CP departments. Although
apparently cost-effective, it often results in the COS challenges being addressed with solutions from the
CP system that are not relevant to the COS system (e.g., the focus on removal of threats). Not enough
resources are allocated to COS due to the overwhelming need and preference for CP. Having a dedicated
steering committee for COS with representation from all stakeholder groups, including children, will highlight
the uniqueness of the COS system and its challenges.
The Covid-19 pandemic influenced the implementation of interventions and the lack of commitment from
some stakeholder groups hampered the programme's reach. However, the pandemic also provided
opportunities to raise awareness of the importance of internet access and highlighted the dangers for
children. The flexibility of implementers to adapt materials and methods significantly strengthened the
system.
Efficiency
The programme had two no-cost extensions that allowed the completion of some activities affected by the
Covid-19 pandemic. The extensions did not influence the quality of programme delivery or the allocation of
budget items. The changes in the line items, limited financial and monitoring information, and the complex
nature of the systems approach, prevented value for money from being calculated. This does not distract
from the finding that the programme was efficient in delivering activities and relevant outputs. The optimal
use of partner and consultant skills and structures (including existing processes) enabled a cost-effective
operation. The programme needs to be attentive to the requirements to determine the value for money and
ensure that this is available for the next evaluation.
Sustainability
Sustainability was assessed on two levels. The sustainability of the results of the programme interventions
after completion and the feasibility of the system to continue working towards COS without the UNICEF
programme.
The sustainability of the programme results (and intended interventions) was generally low. Some activities
did not take place due to Covid-19 and the replacement interventions did not have the same effect. For
example, the development of a handbook and brochure for SAPS made good use of the programme budget
and the skills of the consultant, but training is still needed to reach the intended stakeholders. The
programme lacked gatekeeping of internet access to children due to the absence of the ICT industry. A
commitment to fulfil its responsibility is critical. The sustainability of the knowledge generated was high but,
without dissemination of the information to all stakeholder groups, it will lose its significant effect.
75
Conversely, the sustainability of the system was high. This was mostly due to the structural integrity of the
system as it was based on existing facilities and procedures (mainly based on government structures). This
can be further enhanced by including CS structures and leverage points to reach important stakeholder
groups, such as community members and children. The system also needs to be expanded by including
additional subsystems (e.g., NPA, DOH, and other community structures).
Equity and gender responsiveness
The programme did not address gender or equity directly. Strengthening the system focused on the
assumption that all children with access to the internet were at risk and that structures should be in place
to protect them. Target beneficiaries (such as trainees) were not selected based on any characteristics or
vulnerabilities. More targeted interventions for groups identified as vulnerable will need to be included in
the next phase of the programme. These target groups should be context specific (for example, service
providers identified different groups based on gender, age, or socio-economic status). More research is
needed to clarify this and information will only become clear through continued engagement with all
stakeholders (especially children).
There were power discrepancies between stakeholder groups with larger government departments being
more likely to drive the process. UNICEF harnessed these strengths but an approach of inclusiveness and
participation of all stakeholder groups (including a wider range of government departments) is needed.
Power relations will need to be addressed.
9.1.3 System changes
Foundational building blocks for the system to function are in place. This includes the system-wide
awareness of the importance of COS and the generation of essential knowledge.
The COS system is contained within the CR system with significant overlap with the CP system and
similarities to VAC prevention. However, it has a unique character that calls for distinctive solutions. One
aspect is the range of victims involved, from those being directly targeted, to witnesses of events, and those
who share images intentionally and unintentionally. Perpetrators are similarly diverse and can include
children. The mixture of physical and online violence (e.g., sharing of incidents) makes treatment and
prevention different from general CP issues. Another aspect is the technical skills of children that frequently
surpass those of adult caregivers and service providers. This makes cascading of skills and using
caregivers as the main gatekeepers to prevent harm both ineffective and insufficient. Furthermore, solutions
such as simply avoiding the threat are not applicable as internet access is a critical children’s right as
highlighted by Covid-19 and the implications on education and learning. The system needs to be recognized
as unique with a dedicated steering mechanism that is inclusive of all stakeholders.
The interrelatedness of the system components has not received enough attention and the limited
interaction between stakeholders and even within sub-systems was apparent (e.g., between government
departments and between government and CS). It is important to consider the dynamic nature of the COS
system where a careful balance should be maintained between ensuring internet access to all children,
controlling and regulating access of predators, providing protection to the vulnerable, and treatment to those
affected by online violations. The system also needs expansion through the inclusion of other components
and by including stakeholder groups within a component (for example, diversification of training to
community members). Understanding the dynamic nature of interaction among different components and
the system-wide implications of change within a subsystem is critical to strengthening the whole.
The most important consideration is the use of system touchpoints as spaces where the various stakeholder
groups can be engaged. Expanding these touchpoints will reach a wider audience for awareness and skills
transfer. The leverage points in the system where the interventions can be most effective also need to be
identified and used. These include RCL systems in schools and the involvement of CBOs that work with
children, while online games and applications can provide another entry point.
76
9.2 Good practices
There were four good practices in the system that should be highlighted:
9.2.1 Recognizing system transformation is needed
The acknowledgement by the Global Alliance and UNICEF that the issue of COS can only be addressed
through system change (strengthening) is a practice that needs to be more widely applied. Although system
thinking is not yet embedded, changing the focus and recognizing its importance was a major first step. It
is recommended that strategically planning system transformation and allowing the evaluation to use a
system approach be documented and shared to enhance learning and the evaluation of system
transformation.
9.2.2 Building a solid knowledge foundation
Although it would be logical to establish a strong knowledge foundation for programmes it is seldom done
through solid and rigorous research. Doing so would allow more strategic planning and contribute to the
national system, subsystems, and international efforts to ensure the online safety of children.
The full dissemination of the research results was delayed to ensure that the report is optimally used but
they have already impacted many interventions and will continue to do so. The possibility of a follow-up
study and the insights it will bring is something to look forward to.
9.2.3 Incorporating key subsystems
The UNICEF programme began with a model for incorporating important subsystems. Not waiting for a full
system analysis but using programme logic to strengthen parts of the system already in place was a useful
approach. The key departments that participated built critical mass and momentum. Other departments will
be more likely to commit to the efforts based on the evidence of system transformation and continuous
review will unveil how other departments and organizations can play a role.
9.2.4 Reaching children through peer dialogue
One of the partner organizations (Agape Youth Movement) uses an approach of peer dialogue. This was
identified as a key strength and investigating and adapting this model for further engagement and training
efforts with children is highly recommended. It is envisaged that peer dialogue can also be applied by
service providers and CS implementors.
9.3 Lessons learned
The key lesson from the programme implementation is that a systems approach does not need to be
labelled as such to affect system change. The UNICEF programme was not explicitly called a system
transformation programme, yet the aim to strengthen the system indicated that it focused on that structure.
Further system transformation will be accelerated if all staff and stakeholders in the programme are more
aware of the basic system principles (such as interrelatedness and boundaries) and optimally apply them
during implementation. Some of the lessons of the programme regarding system transformation highlighted
in this evaluation are:
77
• Foundational knowledge is critical and an early priority. The Disrupting Harm study contributed
foundational knowledge to all sub-components of the system.
• Wide awareness of the topic for all stakeholders in the system is essential early in the system
development.
• Acknowledging that a system can function within another system (COS within CP), yet contain key
components outside of that system (such as the unique balance of risks to benefits of internet access).
• Understanding and appreciating the system approach by the different subsystems can alleviate the
damaging effects of working in silos.
78
10. RECOMMENDATIONS
The recommendations reflect on how current gaps can be alleviated and interventions improved due to the
summative nature of the evaluation. It, therefore, aims to improve the continued effects and sustainability
of the completed programme and similar programmes. But, more importantly, as funding has been secured
for another phase of the programme, the recommendations are also formative and aim to ensure the
implementation of lessons in the new phase of the COS programme.
The recommendations are broadly categorized as targeting the system transformation process (including
structural changes and interventions), monitoring and evaluation (for learning about and within the system),
enhancing the Model National Response, and specific recommendations for future evaluations and
research.
The process of developing the recommendations firstly included the engagement of all respondents.
Specific questions in the interviews and surveys elicited stakeholder perspectives on priorities. It was
important to ensure views and recommendations of all stakeholders were included regarding their sub-
system as well as their views on the COS system. Suggested recommendations were tested with other
respondents as interviews progressed. These were only included at the end of each interview to avoid bias.
The integrated and refined draft recommendations were presented to the ERG. The recommendations were
based on information from all systems of both rights-holders and duty bearers. Children were not involved
as direct respondents, but the Disrupting Harm study results ensured that their views were included on
system transformation issues rather than programme implementation priorities.
10.1 System transformation
It is important to consider the goal of keeping children safe online while ensuring access to the internet can
only be achieved through system transformation. This necessitates awareness that all interventions are
systemic and it requires thinking and working systemically. To strengthen the system, all the stakeholders
need to be involved and work towards overall system transformation, which will alleviate the silo mindset
and way of working. The focus is to make it very clear to all stakeholders and subsystems that the
programme and work on child online safety (COS) are systemic. Assumptions about the system and the
subsystem roles should be prominent and tested regularly using a Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system
(with a framework, tools, and dataset) that can reflect the complex system changes and be geared primarily
for learning and accountability.
10.1.1 Systems thinking to guide COS programme implementation
Recommendation 1:
UNICEF South Africa COS programme staff should strategically reflect on
the systemic nature and boundaries of the COS system, how it influences the second phase of the
programme, and how the various interventions and stakeholders fit into the broader COS system. UNICEF
CP staff can then influence higher-level understanding and implementation of systems thinking to key
government departments such as DSD and DBE.
Priority: high | Timeframe: immediate | Responsibility: UNICEF CP
Firstly, all stakeholders should understand and be aware of systemic programmes and how to apply
systems thinking. It is essential to recognize that changes in sub-systems are interlinked and that a shift in
one affects the whole system. This will require not only a paradigm shift but also knowledge of systems
thinking. Secondly, the COS should be understood as a system within the CP and CR frameworks but with
unique characteristics and components outside of those systems. The system is unique in that it both
focuses on access (providing a right) and restrictions (protection from harm and treatment). It would be
79
damaging to simply see the COS programme and interventions as contributing part of CP, GBV, or VAC
strategies. This is relevant for all subsystems, including government departments and service providers.
This is a higher-level recommendation for all stakeholders in the system.
The responsibility of UNICEF South Africa is to reflect on the continued programme interventions and
recognize and use the systemic nature of all child online safety work by UNICEF South Africa. This will
ensure that all stakeholders (subsystems such as government departments, implementing partners, and
Civil Society) are aware and influenced to contribute systemically.
10.1.2 Subsystem stakeholders and relationships
Recommendation 2:
UNICEF South Africa COS programme staff should ensure that important
stakeholders targeted in the original programme proposal that were not reached are included in the second
phase of the programme (ICT industry, CS, DCDT, SAPS, and DOJ). UNICEF South Africa can also play
an important advocacy role in championing the inclusion of additional stakeholders (DHA and DOH) and
enhancing relationships between subsystems and stakeholders.
Priority: high and critical | Timeframe: immediate | Responsibility: UNICEF CP
The initial four components of the programme provided a formal structure for the first phase. UNICEF should
continue with capacity-building and sensitization programmes designed to reach all actors in the space. It
is recommended that stakeholders are included in each subsystem and that additional subsystems are
included in the UNICEF Programme. The suggested changes include the following:
• Separating the national structure into different components or sub-systems comprising government and
civil society (CS). The current combination of these two into a single “national” level has diluted the
effect and contributions of CS. Civil society has a larger role to play in advocacy for access, service
provision (preventative, protection, and mitigation), and a role as training partners.
• The ICT industry urgently needs to be involved, especially as the main gatekeeper and access provider.
• The intended stakeholders and partners that were not involved in the programme should be added,
including DCDT, DOJ, and SAPS.
• The inclusion of other government departments, such as DHA and DOH, should be considered.
• The current “individual” level subsystem includes caregivers (parents) and community members. These
stakeholders have different functions and should therefore have distinct interventions.
• Children are the ultimate target and should be considered as the overarching subsystem. Currently, the
design assumes that caregivers, service providers, and community members will cascade skills to
children. Although this may happen, it is not the most effective intervention. Placing children at the
centre changes the dynamic, ensuring caregiver and community interventions focus on strengthening
their roles rather than acting as intermediaries for the programme to reach children.
• The community subsystem should be broadened to include other structures besides FBOs and religious
leaders. Suggestions include traditional and local leadership, CBO, and informal associations.
10.1.3 Touch points and leverage points
Recommendation 3:
UNICEF South Africa CP technical advisors should play a coordinating role
to identify touch points (spaces where children and community members can be engaged) and leverage
spots in the system. Doing so will ensure efforts have a maximal effect and this needs to be communicated
with implementing partners as a matter of priority.
80
Priority: high | Timeframe: short-term | Responsibility: UNICEF CP manager and those providing
technical support to partners
UNICEF South Africa and all implementing partners should go beyond the traditional points of intervention
delivery. As the programme aimed to strengthen the system, the next step is not only cascading that to
unreached subsystems but also to communities and children in various ways. It is therefore critical to
identify spaces to engage community members and children at deeper levels. It is also important to optimize
activities by targeting specific leverage points. UNICEF South Africa should identify these from the
suggestions provided by literature, the participants of this evaluation, and engagement with children about
programme activities.
10.1.4 Specific interventions
Recommendation 4:
The role players in the COS system and programme as managed by
UNICEF South Africa should move from awareness activities to more specific interventions. This includes
expanding the depth of the work with children beyond just reach and including and strengthening other
system structures and components. UNICEF South Africa is uniquely situated to influence the strategic
move to more targeted interventions.
Priority: high | Timeframe: short term | Responsibility: UNICEF COS programme and all other
implementing partners
The recommendations to strengthen the implementation are the following:
• Moving beyond awareness to focused training. In some instances, this is possible through the
integration of materials in existing curricula and training (e.g., SAPS) but others need dedicated
programmes. Examples are caregivers, social workers, community and front-line workers, and
healthcare workers (especially those involved in mental health) beyond those included as part of VAC
interventions.
• Working with children requires specific approaches. Peer-to-peer dialogue seems to be the best
method for reaching children. This should be investigated, documented, and adjusted for the roll-out of
more in-depth and targeted training. This is an issue of depth of interventions.
• Training should be rolled out beyond the current scope. The training of educators should include other
provinces and needs strategies to determine high-priority districts and the cascading of training. The
training of social service providers should be expanded to a wider group of personnel. This is
a reach/scope issue.
• Incomplete activities and those not done due to circumstances should be prioritized. The training of
law enforcement and justice officials (SAPS and DOJ) is essential and will need the commitment of all
departments. Similarly, the involvement of the ICT industry and Civil Society is critical. The limited
engagement with DCDT needs urgent attention.
• The focus should now shift to outcomes in terms of intention and measurement. The focus on
awareness should move to knowledge and skill transfer and this should be measured regularly. The
aim should be measurable behaviour change.
10.1.5 Addressing equity and gender
Recommendation 5:
UNICEF South Africa COS staff and its research partners should investigate
and identify the most vulnerable and marginalized groups in each sub-system, address power issues that
threaten COS and prevent optimal intervention, and measure changes for these groups.
81
Priority: high | Timeframe: long-term | Responsibility: UNICEF CP and MEL, research partners, SAPS,
DoJ, and NPA
This completed phase of the programme effectively focused on strengthening the system through
knowledge generation and raising awareness of the various subsystems. It would be critical in future to
identify the most vulnerable and marginalized groups and address their needs specifically. This includes
the benefits of connectivity, the protection of children, and addressing services for those victimized.
Disadvantaged groups (including those with fewer opportunities and resources and those with financial
difficulties) were identified. They need specially designed interventions. Online violence and abuse are
strongly related to power discrepancies, with girls remaining the most high-risk group. This does not imply
resources should only be geared toward girls, but rather that programmes addressing gender should be
developed and implemented.
Special attention should also be given to addressing groups beyond the linear perpetrator-victim continuum.
The needs of children who enable online violence and abuse, those who record and share incidents, and
those indirectly affected (witnessing in physical proximity or through shared images) should also be
addressed.
10.2 Monitoring and evaluation system
It was challenging for the evaluation to verify information on targets reached. Part of the challenge was in
the types (online awareness is difficult to capture) and calculation of data from different subsystems.
However, the programme would be richer and progress easier to track if an M&E system was in place
(including tools and a central database that can capture the complexity of system changes). This would not
only enhance accountability, planning, and timely adjustments of efforts but, more importantly, ensure
continuous reflection and learning around the system changes.
Recommendation 6:
UNICEF South Africa MEL should urgently develop a functional and dynamic
M&E system for the UNICEF COS programme (phase 2). The system should allow reflection on progress
towards targets and capture and reflect on system transformation.
Priority: critical | Timeframe: immediate | Responsibility: UNICEF CP and MEL
For optimal functioning, the M&E system needs to address both traditional (DAC) criteria and systems
thinking. It is recommended that the M&E database include:
• Data captured for monitoring purposes. This should comprise capturing the targets reached for each
subsystem as well as cumulative numbers. It should also include collecting secondary data from partner
organizations and encouraging the collection of data where it is not available.
• Qualitative data to capture system changes and the process needed to achieve them. Using the
following criteria as a guide will ensure that system changes are not only captured but that subsystems
are kept informed.
• System and subsystem descriptions with clear boundaries
• System dynamics and inter-relatedness of subsystems (to identify and change silo behaviour and
the replication of efforts)
• Leverage points
• Intervention strategies
• Assumptions
82
• Capturing lessons learned and good practices. For example, recording the lessons learned and
reflecting on these regularly will enhance adaptations and the roll-out of activities. Another example is
documenting and using the process of peer-to-peer dialogue to capacitate children.
Another recommendation related to the M&E system is the training of project staff (of all subsystems) on
the M&E framework. This should focus on the following:
• Awareness of the value of continuous data input, monitoring, and reflection, as well as the importance
of evaluations.
• System transformation criteria.
• Technical aspects to capture and use data from the system, including reporting and programme and
project management.
10.3 Disseminating knowledge and development of the Model
National Response (MNR) and action plans
Development of an MNR and action plans for subsystems are crucial. The first step is formally disseminating
the knowledge already generated. All subsystems need to work together to develop the MNR based on the
knowledge yielded through the Disrupting Harm study and the development of materials. It is essential to
align all work done within the system, such as CR and CP (both nationally and within UNICEF).
The recommendations of this evaluation, including the sharing of knowledge generated, identifying leverage
spots and touchpoints, and the development of the MNR, can be coordinated to occur at the same event
where all stakeholder groups from the subsystems meet in person.
10.3.1 Disseminating knowledge generated
Recommendation 7
: UNICEF South Africa and DSD should urgently prioritize the sharing of
knowledge generated through the programme. Research, such as the Disrupting Harm and Kids Online
studies, as well as the knowledge and lessons gleaned during the material development efforts should be
disseminated
Priority: urgent for other activities to follow | Timeframe: immediate | Responsibility: UNICEF CP, DSD,
research, and development partners
The essential (and exceptionally executed) Disrupting Harm study specifically addressed aspects to enable
the understanding and strengthening of the COS system in South Africa. The dissemination of this
knowledge is critical for strategic planning across the entire system. The process of developing materials
further contributed to a solid foundational body of knowledge but the communication of the learning was
hampered due to delays in the international and national launch of the report. This information must be
shared in a formal event with all stakeholders. Dedicated resources and time will be needed to ensure a
wide representation and commitment of all levels and components of the system.
10.3.2 Development and adjustment of Model National Response
Recommendation 8:
UNICEF South Africa should influence the collaborative process to develop
a South African Model National Response with whole system participation, including child representation.
83
Priority: high | Timeframe: immediate | Responsibility: UNICEF CP and all stakeholder groups, not
dominated by any single entity or government department
The development of a Model National Response (MNR) is critical for every stakeholder group and
subsystem working on COS and is pivotal to forming a coordinated national response. One of the main
recommendations of this evaluation is that a work session, or series of work sessions, be conducted with
all role players present. The first step will be sharing the Disrupting Harm study findings and the additional
knowledge generated by the programme. Breaking the silo approach that has been used thus far and
alleviating the power dynamics of some subsystems is an essential step in strengthening the COS system.
The steps can include:
• Sharing the findings of the Disrupting Harm study and lessons learned from the materials
development process.
• Sharing and reflecting on the findings relevant to each subsystem.
• Development of a national coordination mechanism (steering group) consisting of representatives
of all subsystems (donor organizations and child and youth representatives) with rotating or shared
leadership.
• Development of the overarching MNR and adjusting the global MNR for the South African context
based on the knowledge-sharing event.
• Development of individual subsystem action plans.
• Contributions to a shared and central M&E system to track progress, maintain accountability, and,
more importantly, ensure continuous learning.
Elements from the global MNR (see Annex XIV for Summary of We Protect MNR 2015) needing revision
to ensure a contextually relevant and coherent South African MNR should be based on the local research
and knowledge base. Evaluation suggestions include:
• Enabler considerations:
• Emphasis should be placed on multi-disciplinary and cross-sectional collaboration to avoid the
current problem of silo work.
• Justice and prosecution agents need to be urgently included in the programme.
• The reporting environment should include ICT structures and strengths.
• Data and evidence should be accessible to the whole system and in formats that address varying
audiences (child-friendly versions) and modes (electronic and hard copies).
• Subsystem capability considerations:
• The “victims” group consists of different subgroups that need unique interventions and information.
For example, there are victims directly affected by perpetrators but also indirect secondary victims,
such as online and offline witnesses and those sharing incidents with others. The effects of these
are complex and distinct to each group.
• Industry, both ICT and other corporate responsibilities, should be co-opted.
10.4 Recommendations for future evaluations and research
Recommendation 9:
UNICEF South Africa should ensure that future evaluations of the
programme include children’s voices and a strategic plan for a follow-up Disrupting Harm study.
84
Priority: medium | Timeframe: long-term | Responsibility: UNICEF South Africa MEL, research
consultants
As this evaluation took place early in the system transformation process and did not include the influence
on child behaviour it is vital to incorporate a substantial impact component in the next evaluation. This
should not only measure impact but investigate qualitatively how system changes affected children.
Including all stakeholders and subsystems is important but listening to the voices of children is even more
critical. The next phase of the programme's design and implementation should already include ethical
statements and requirements for including children as respondents in the evaluation. This can be done by
including consent in programme activities and early application for ethical clearance from relevant review
bodies.
It was envisaged in the programme documents that the Disrupting Harm study will be repeated in future to
measure change. The timing of this study will be important and should be based on assessments of system
transformation.

5a. Summary of Activities (Brief summary of activities targeting societal change. No more than 100 words):
In 2020, a lot of time and effort was put in development of awareness raising tools and training materials. As the world
turned to a virtual mode of work, the momentum was very opportune towards creating awareness on online protection
and safeguarding of children. In addition to the awareness raising tools, UNICEF also organised a few national level
televised webinars with policy makers, activists and children themselves to create high level awareness on child
protection online. Compounded by the use of Tik Tok and other social medial platforms this reached many children and
youth in and beyond SA. We also trained 173 religious leaders on online protection.

7. SYSTEM LEVEL
7a. Summary of Activities (Brief summary of activities targeting systems change. No more than 100 words):
The biggest system change achieved last year, was SAs commitment to signing up to the Global We Protect Alliance
and therewith the commitment to develop a SA Model National Response. Additionally, progress was made in the
changes in the law to strengthen the protection from online violence, harm and abuse. Also the development of the
training toolkit which was endorsed by Department of Social Development and uploaded on their online learning platform
for all social service professionals to be trained with an officially accredited course. Another systemic change was the
Ministerial commitment and a training plan with all duty bearers on online protection.

Key Informant Interview Schedule: Partners
UNICEF Questions
Thank you for meeting with me today. I am doing an evaluation of the UNICEF (and DSD) Child Online
Safety programme. I am looking at the programme not as a single intervention just targeting children,
but as changes in the child protection system in South Africa, where we have many different important
role players. My questions will ask you about changes for children, your system, and the larger system.
Involvement
Please tell me about your involvement in the UNICEF Online Safety Programme:
Involvement, Context
Own perception – I value your unique perspective on the situation.
• What is your view on online access for children? Is it important, what are the positives and
negatives?
• What is the opinion of people you work with or engage with? (same or different). Do you think
South Africans in general see it the same? What is the national government priorities?
• Who are the key role players? Who are the change agents?
• What is the current situation in your area of work/intervention (e.g., research)?
• Was there any change in the past 5 years? How much change has happened so far? What are
the factors that influence this (good and bad)?
Changes due to the UNICEF programme
What changes did you see in the online safety of children due to the UNICEF programme?
• For you
• For your organisation
• For children
• For other organisations/role players
How did these changes happen?
• Who was involved?
• What did they do? (what could they have done better)
• How well did they do what they were supposed to?
Were there any new links/networks created btw partners/stakeholders?
Were all role players equally committed?
Who or what were the leverage points?
Effectiveness/Efficiency
• Were the resources assigned to the programme sufficient?
• Was the activities and interventions correctly prioritised?
• How were inequalities addressed (power relationships/access)? Did it improve?
Next steps
• What are the goals for the future?

ANNEX XI: INFORMED CONSENT FORM
Evaluation of the Global Partnership to End Violence against Children- UNICEF
Online Child Protection programme in South Africa.
Adult Consent Form
Background:
UNICEF South Africa, in close collaboration with the Department of Social Development, has sought to
strengthen national systems on safeguarding children online through its online protection programme
funded through the Global Partnership to End Violence against Children.
The initiative undertaken included:
i. creating awareness on online safety amongst communities
ii. integration of online content into existing programming
iii. educating communities on the dangers and risks children can face online
iv. developing training material and training front line workers
v. initiating and conducting an online study to scope usage, risks, and opportunities children face
in the digital space.
Subsequently, South Africa, engaged in several consultations and data collection initiatives, on child
safeguarding in the digital space as well as identified possible best practice models for piloting with the
intent of sharing tested solutions with the Government of South Africa for scaling to protect and care for
children online.
UNICEF South Africa is now conducting an evaluation to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of
these programme interventions. To this end, UNICEF South Africa has contracted Dr Madri Jansen Van
Rensburg as an evaluator to undertake this exercise. The evaluation will focus on understanding the
extent to which the various components undertaken in the programme have contributed towards
strengthening national systems on protecting children online. The recommendations drawn from the
evaluation will be used to further strengthen programming in this area.
