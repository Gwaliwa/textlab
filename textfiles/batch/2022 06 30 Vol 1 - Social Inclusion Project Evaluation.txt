EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report presents the independent evaluation of the Project “Social Inclusion of Roma Children and Children with
Disabilities in the Western Balkans and Moldova” (2018-2021). The report outlines the evaluation’s background and
approach, findings, lessons learned, conclusions and recommendations. The evaluation was conducted from
October 2021 to June 2022.
OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
The Project aimed to promote social inclusion in the context of early child development (ECD) policies and services,
especially for boys and girls from ethnic minority groups such as Roma1, as well as boys and girls with
developmental challenges and disabilities. It covered Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo*2, Moldova,
Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia, at the central government level and in selected municipalities.
Implementation of relevant national strategies in the geographic area covered by the Project has faced challenges
due to, among others, inter-sectoral coordination, inclusiveness and quality of services, as well as inadequate
financing of relevant social care, protection and pre-primary education (PPE) services.
The Project included two outcomes. The first outcome concerned ECD support to families/parents/caregivers and
children within the communities, including nurturing care, health services, early detection and intervention services.
Under this outcome, the outputs dealt, firstly, with the enhancement of services to beneficiaries with regard to
relevant policies and their implementation. This covered the development of national and sub-national policies and
mechanisms that contribute to realization of rights; accompanying enhancement of knowledge and skills of service
providers; increased support to the availability of the innovative services for children and parents/caregivers;
expansion of the early child intervention services and building of the awareness on the importance of child
development among parents/caregivers. The second outcome focused on development of PPE in targeted areas,
with one output on capacity building of the relevant professionals.
The Project was funded by Austrian Development Agency (ADA), with matching UNICEF funding. The total Project
budget stood at 2,513,160 EUR, with ADA contribution totalling 1,799,999 EUR and UNICEF contributing 713,117
EUR.
EVALUATION PURPOSE, OBJECTIVES AND INTENDED AUDIENCE
The overall purpose of the evaluation is to inform the evaluation users about the achievements of the Project,
contributing and adverse factors, and lessons learned, which support accountability and evidence-based decision
making. The chosen approach was therefore mostly summative, creating understanding of the effects of the Project
and ensuring accountability for resources and results. It had a secondary formative element to promote
organisational learning based on the impact of the Project on the direct/immediate and end beneficiaries (when
possible). When taken together, these two aspects should support organisational learning and informed decision
making concerning the Project follow up.
The evaluation provides an independent assessment of the performance of the Project in relation to expected
results, offers actionable recommendations for UNICEF for improving its work at country3 and regional levels, and
for enhancing the sustainability of the attained changes. It also identifies lessons learned, good practices and
innovative approaches, which may serve UNICEF and actors working toward improving ECD systems which are
inclusive of vulnerable children, including Roma children and children with disabilities.

UNICEF ECARO and relevant Country Offices (COs), and the donor agency ADA are considered as the primary
users of the evaluation. Relevant government decision makers, civil society organizations (CSOs), implementing
partners, other United Nations Agencies working in related fields, and pertinent rights-holders are its secondary
users. Overall, the evaluation report and management response are intended to be public, thus fulfilling UNICEF’s
commitment to transparency and accountability.
EVALUATION METHODOLOGY
This evaluation applies a theory-based approach: it tests the validity of the Project’s Theory of Change (ToC) against
its implementation. At each level of the ToC, the evaluation first determined whether the envisaged change took
place and whether the assumptions underlying the theory were realized. Then, contribution analysis was used to
check the plausibility and, wherever possible, the extent of the Project’s contribution to these changes.
After the initial analysis of the original Project ToC, certain structural shortfalls were identified. Subsequently, the
evaluation team reconstructed the ToC, in consultation with UNICEF, and assigned the underlying assumptions to
its appropriate levels, so that the resulting format became more usable for the evaluation purpose.
The evaluation framework was based on the OECD/DAC criteria of relevance, effectiveness, impact,
sustainability, and coherence. These criteria were translated into evaluation questions and adapted to the ToC-
based evaluation format. Together with sub-questions, these formed the evaluation matrix.
Primary data collection included 73 interviews with UNICEF staff, donor and other international partners, CSOs,
national duty bearers in relevant ministries/agencies, staff/service providers in sampled municipalities, and
parents/caregivers. The evaluation team also undertook a comprehensive review of UNICEF publications, and of
the Project’s documentation, reports, and documentary products. The evaluation team further collected secondary
documentary data, such as third-party publications. The evaluation made two “deep dive” analyses of the changes
triggered by the Project, respectively in Kosovo* and North Macedonia.
Owing to the restrictions linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, evaluation activities were carried out remotely, online.
This presented certain challenges in accessing interviewees and duty-bearers in “deep dive” countries, since these
were engaged as frontline personnel in addressing the pandemic. The limitations affected the depth of collected
data, but the evaluation modality was adjusted, with most interviewees contacted online.
KEY FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
The evaluation found that through this Project, UNICEF managed to effectively leverage its evidence-based
knowledge, skills and long-term presence in the field. UNICEF applied their knowledge of the local contexts and
situation analyses to the Project design, and to address the needs of the duty bearers and CSOs working on ECD.
All the while, the Project maintained the capacity to adjust the interventions, by drawing on close communication
with stakeholders.
The prior, close partnerships of UNICEF with national stakeholders meant that the national policy, legislative and
regulatory frameworks already echoed the UNICEF approach to inclusive ECD, and/or increasingly did so through
Project implementation. This mutually re-enforcing relationship between the UNICEF approach and national
normative frameworks made the Project-related interventions highly relevant. It is also in line with the systems
approach promoted by UNICEF, which prioritizes the strengthening of country-level inclusive systems that respond
to the needs of every rights holder – and indeed every child.
The systems approach was compatible with the donor-driven focus on specific groups of children (Roma children
7
and children with disabilities)4, but not always fully aligned. In certain national contexts – contrary to the assumptions
– it was assessed that the vulnerability of the targeted groups, while valid, was not always the most in need
compared to that of other groups. It was sometimes difficult for duty bearers to understand this prioritization. Yet,
the evaluation found that UNICEF addressed and resolved this problem through engagement with the donor and
subsequent programmatic adjustments to cover other vulnerable groups and continue the Project relevancy to
stakeholders’ needs.
The evaluation assessed the extent to which the Project was able to consider the different situations of men/boys
and women/girls in relation to ECD and inclusion of the target groups. The evaluation found that the Project activities
indeed focused on gender transformative results, both when training ECD professionals, and when reaching out to
a gender-balanced range of beneficiaries. However, the Project documents and reports did not explicitly link the
design of these activities with the gender analysis performed by UNICEF as a part of its country programming cycle.
The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected the Project’s implementation. Firstly, the modality of in-person
interaction, which is the essence of the modelled services (PPE services, home visiting, health services, direct
support and guidance to parents/caregivers, early identification, and intervention services for the most vulnerable
children at home) was no longer viable. In addition, many of the Project’s national partners were at the frontlines of
pandemic response. Despite these unprecedented challenges, all Project partners maintained their engagement
and helped the Project adapt to the exigencies imposed by the pandemic. UNICEF staff also performed effectively
in ensuring transition to new, online implementation modalities – especially in education and training – by working
in close partnership with implementing CSOs, national authorities, and service providers at municipal or community
levels. The flexibility shown by the donor in accepting some unavoidable delays made such adaptation possible.
The Project contributed substantially to the realization of expected changes in the national policies and legal
frameworks of the respective countries. This is especially apparent when it comes to promoting a holistic approach
to ECD (integrating health, social care/protection, and child-centered PPE). These elements have become more
deeply embedded in the policies and legal acts recently adopted in the countries. That said, the implementation of
better ECD policy and legislation, their funding, and their translation into institutionalized practice, are still a work in
progress.
The effectiveness of the Project has been documented through its role in strengthening networked ECD
practitioners who share a common commitment and have compatible skills and vision for ECD in their respective
fields of work. Training, networking, and adjustment of both formal and informal institutional arrangements around
the newly acquired skills of the professionals have enabled the Project to model health, social care, child protection
and PPE services to the rights holders, including in remote areas. The practitioners and parents/caregivers that
were interviewed reported that certain changes of attitudes are taking place, and that the trained professionals
increasingly use the skills promoted through the Project. Quantitatively, the Project has reached all, and exceeded
several, of its targets in terms of the number of beneficiaries reached.
The evaluation found that the Project’s monitoring was strong, but disproportionally burdensome, when considering
the Project’s budget, broken down by year and country. The Project’s targets, which were exclusively quantitative,
did not lend themselves to qualitative analysis of processes and trends: this is regrettable in the context of a systems
approach, which works on the establishment of long-term institutional process and behavioural changes. In addition,
despite UNICEF’s efforts to collect baseline and monitor quantitative data (in particular with the Multi-Indicator
Cluster Surveys), the Project faced weaknesses in the national administrative data. Even though the Project helped
mitigate some of these shortcomings, – by, for example, establishing a national registry of children with disabilities
in Serbia and by elaborating data collection tools – this has not been the Project’s primary intended purpose, and
the financial and capacity resources were insufficient for resolving the problem. Finally, the Project ToC placed
expectations of changes disproportionately high compared to the budget and duration of the Project, and it did not
identify internal and external assumptions at each level of change, which created overly ambitious reporting
demands.
4 This targeted approach stems from the high priority placed by ADA as a part of its strategic objectives, to poverty reduction
(https://www.entwicklung.at/fileadmin/user_upload/Dokumente/Publikationen/Leitlinien/Englisch/PD_Poverty_reduction_Dec2009_EN.pdf)
and gender (https://www.entwicklung.at/fileadmin/user_upload/Dokumente/Publikationen/Leitlinien/Englisch/PD_Gender_2017_EN.pdf).

Looking at impact, overall, the Project made inroads towards inclusive ECD, especially when compared to its
timeline and resources. The institutions engaged in the Project have advanced significantly towards expanding
coverage and access to ECD, specifically social care/protection, health and PPE services in pilot municipalities
even though the COVID-19 pandemic and limited human resources have dampened the prospects of making such
transformation systemic. By continuing to strengthen partnerships with key institutions, the Project contributed
meaningfully to the duty bearers’ awareness of the ECD needs, gaps and opportunities which has improved policy
and affected the quality of services. The parents/caregivers who did access the modelled services self-report
changed attitudes towards their children, towards services, and towards their own role. These successes are largely
attributable to the personal commitment of change champions at national and local levels, connection with whom
UNICEF continues to nurture. The Project’s choice to strengthen and improve existing services, rather than to
create new ones (with a few exceptions), was conducive to secure the necessary public funding. Yet, as the
interviews attest, the duty bearers are reaching the limits of what can be improved within the available human
resources.
The evaluation found that UNICEF is the right partner for this Project and has leveraged its strengths to achieve
results. The intervention was conceived as a part of the long-term engagement of UNICEF for the realisation of
ECD standards and approach and thus remained fundamentally coherent with UNICEF’s strategy. By optimizing its
key comparative advantages – presence in the field, expertise of its staff, quality of its evidence generation– the
Project has achieved considerable success with relatively limited resources. The process of the Project helped
further diversify the existing long-term partnerships cultivated by UNICEF at national and local levels, which were
in turn used to expand the generation and application of knowledge.
In several countries, UNICEF also acted as a “convener”. The breadth and depth of the changes observed goes
beyond the Project: it is also attributable to the existing partnerships and accrued reputation of UNICEF in the field,
and to the action of other donor and international partners who complemented or followed on UNICEF’s action.
Because of its long-term, professional cooperation with CSOs and duty bearers who work on ECD at both national
and local levels, and because of its wealth of evidence-based knowledge and guidance, UNICEF was able to
convene the relevant stakeholders and act as a trusted adviser. Matching funds from other donors helped expand
and magnify the impact of the Project results.
KEY RECOMMENDATIONS
1. ADA would better optimise future investments into UNICEF projects by allowing UNICEF ECARO programmes
(such as ECD) to develop full-fledged theories of change at a realistic level for future complex projects, as this
would increase the feasibility and tailoring of future projects.
2. UNICEF ECARO should continue to advocate to donors and, when successful, support countries to systematize
early detection, early intervention services and standard-based functional assessments.
3. UNICEF ECARO should strengthen, expand and sustain multidisciplinary networks of ECD professionals at
national and regional levels.
4. UNICEF ECARO should build tools to monitor attitude, behavioural and practice changes among trained
practitioners.
5. UNICEF ECARO should continue providing policy guidance to country offices on systematically promoting job
descriptions and internal regulations of ECD duty bearers based on the products already elaborated.
6. For future complex projects, UNICEF ECARO should develop basic information products/documents for
communication purposes.

1. INTRODUCTION
This report presents the results of the evaluation of the Project “Social Inclusion of Roma Children and Children with
Disabilities in the Western Balkans and Moldova” (2018-2021). This Project was funded by the Austrian Development
Agency (ADA) (1.8 million EUR) jointly with the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) (0.7 million EUR) for a total
budget of 2.5 million EUR. It was implemented by UNICEF Europe and Central Asia Regional Office (ECARO) and
seven Country Offices (COs) in the region: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo*5, Moldova, Montenegro, North
Macedonia, and Serbia.
The purpose of this report is to communicate the findings, conclusions and recommendations derived from an
independent, theory-based evaluation of the Project. The evaluation is both summative, presenting how the Theory of
Change (ToC) resulted in outputs, outcomes and impact through the reference period, and formative, demonstrating
what dynamics enabled the results to ultimately contribute to long-term impact, and how future follow-up activities
could be framed. The report includes evidence-based lessons learned and recommendations for UNICEF and ADA.
The evaluation was commissioned by UNICEF Europe and Central Asia Regional Office (ECARO), and managed by
the UNICEF ECARO Evaluation team, with inputs from the Early Child Development (ECD) team.
The evaluation team was comprised of:
• Ms. Camille Massey, International Consultant/Team Leader
• Ms. Blerta Perolli-Shehu, Evaluation Specialist
• Mr. Zarko Sunderic, Evaluation Specialist.
The evaluation process followed three phases:
• Inception: review of initial documentation, elaboration of the methodology, identification of stakeholders,
consultations and one workshop with UNICEF ECD team and COs, development of Inception Report;
• Data collection and field work: remote data collection, 73 interviews (including 63 women and 10 men),
review of the documentation, consultations with key UNICEF RO and CO stakeholders on preliminary
findings;
• Data analysis and reporting: analysis of interview notes, analysis of documentation, report drafting, remote
consultation with key stakeholders, and finalisation of the Evaluation Report.
The evaluation process started on 10 October 2021, and ended in June 2022, as per the agreed timeline.
The interviews and consultations, as well as the validation of findings recommendations were done remotely, as
per standard COVID-19 prevention measures.
2. BACKGROUND
2.1 Context
Social Inclusion
Western Balkan countries and Moldova have ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child
(CRC), the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the
United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. All the countries6 are committed to the

Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Agenda and have in place a robust framework of policies, legislative
frameworks and national strategies with regard to social inclusion, and protection of the human rights of women
and children as well as vulnerable populations, such as ethnic minorities and persons with disabilities. Yet, annual
progress reports of the European Commission point to weaknesses in ensuring realization of fundamental rights of
Roma7 and people/children with disability across Moldova and Western Balkans region. Roma has continued to
face discrimination, harassment and hate crime because of their ethnic origin, as underlined by the recent report
from the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights.8 Further, the rights of persons with disabilities, including
their transition to community-based care and independent living, need to be effectively protected in line with the
requirements of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
The Project document outlines particular barriers in social inclusion of the most vulnerable since services provided
tend to be concentrated, both in quality and quantity, in urban areas and outreach to rural areas is weak; the quality
of universal or primary level services is low; the capacities of service providers are limited, new services around
early intervention and disability prevention are missing and parents/caregivers` involvement as well as involvement
of community-based and civil society organizations as potential partners in advocacy and service provision
represents another challenge.
While countries have made progress in revising national legislation and policies, the institutional capacities for
implementation remain weak. The biggest challenge is the predominant medical approach, i.e., “curing” a disability,
as opposed to the social approach which builds on the strengths of the individual and ensures that their
environments are supportive and enabling rather than restrictive.
According to UNICEF ECARO, the European Union (EU) accession is a cornerstone influencing factor for the
Project countries, which have been investing efforts to harmonize policies and legislation to meet European
standards. However, a sizeable number of children are socially excluded and face risks and deprivations, which
limit their ability to reach their full potential.
Boys and girls from ethnic minority groups such as Roma, as well as boys and girls with developmental challenges
and disabilities suffer disproportionately from poverty, poor access to services and social benefits, exclusion, and
discrimination; they more often suffer from violence, separation from their families and placement in residential care
institutions or special schools. Social and gender norms negatively impact the social inclusion of vulnerable children,
and additionally hamper and limit Roma girls’ participation in education on account of several reasons, including
early marriage.9
The situation of the Project’s target groups with regard to social inclusion and in the context of ECD at the onset of
the Project constituted the baseline against which change will be assessed by this evaluation. According to the
Project document,10 while the situation varied from one country to another, at the launch of the Project, the countries
covered could be characterized as having slow implementation of reforms, especially the implementation of key
national strategies, poor inter-sectoral coordination and quality of services, as well as inadequate financing of social
services.
Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic
The impact of COVID-19, according to UNICEF sources11, in Europe and Central Asia went beyond health risks,
especially for children from poor families, ethnic minorities and children with disabilities, who have been
disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Lack of access to essential and support services increased
as was the isolation and stigmatization of children with disabilities and children from minority communities.

The COVID-19 pandemic plunged the economies of the Western Balkans and Moldova into a profound economic
crisis. In 2020, all countries in the region experienced negative GDP growth, due to reductions in services, exports,
personal consumption, and investment.12 The heath crisis strained the overall social budgets of the governments,
while the existing funds were often re-allocated to towards the urgent needs in healthcare system. Even though the
World Bank estimates indicate that the rate of recovery from the pandemic-induced recession has been faster than
initially projected13, the effects of pandemic-related crisis are still felt.
The health crisis has impacted the situation of children, and perhaps disproportionally so, those who were
considered vulnerable before the crisis. They have been affected by school closures, additional technical and
financial constraints related to transfer of some of school instruction online, travel, circulation and other limitations
imposed in response to the COVID-19 crisis. Social distancing, school closure, protracted closure of the social
interaction venues (parks, child entertainment venues, museums, theatres, etc.), limitations on access to healthcare
(both related and unrelated to the COVID-19 infections), delays and confusion that accompanied the imposition of
the vaccination rules and mandates in several countries had a notable impact on social inclusion, the depth and
breadth of which is only now starting to be properly documented.
Early child development
Ratification and implementation of ECD policies have been a challenge in the region, primarily due to scarce
resources, inadequate understanding of the importance of ECD for optimal child growth and wellbeing, long-term
economic savings for state budgets, competing development priorities, and structures of inequality. Additional
efforts are required to strengthen the rights of the child and to build resilient child protection and childcare systems.
Based on the literature review, the common obstacles to ECD development in Western Balkans and Moldova also
include:14
Discrepancy between adopted policies and their implementation. There is a discrepancy between existing
policies, laws, and strategic action plans, on the one hand, and the implementation of the existing policies that
translate into human capacities, available professional resources, pluralism of services, sufficient budget allocations
and accompanying infrastructure, on the other.
Fragmented services increase deprivations on the family. A family-centred approach model is missing and
fragmented services for the child and family remain a challenge. Due to this fragmentation, the child does not benefit
from a holistic approach which would imply one single support plan for one child and family and cooperation of all
support services and professionals in its implementation.
Integrating nurturing care into health care. The health sector should continue to expand its vision of health
beyond prevention and treatment of disease and include the promotion of nurturing care for children as a crucial
factor in the realization of the human potential of all people.15
Monitoring of the ECD needs to improve. There is a lack of an effective monitoring system on ECD which would
provide information to policymakers and service providers on the precise situation of children. This includes
challenges with data availability for the ECD system and even more specifically lack of disaggregated data across
countries. Children with disabilities as well as Roma children cannot be included unless sound data collection and
analysis render them visible.
Parental practices. Effective parenting support programmes are missing in several countries of the region. Children
who are particularly vulnerable come from families with many children, or from poor rural single-parent families, or
from families living in substandard settlements in extreme material deprivation, where parents/caregivers have a

low educational background. There is a lack of programmes to support parental wellbeing and to promote good
parenting practices.
Governance structures lack effective institutional coordination. In general, the implementation of early
childhood development programmes is often fragmented and uncoordinated, particularly for children under 3 years
and at the local level.
ECD financing remains separated through sectoral budgets and policies. ECD funding is usually directed to
separate sectors, leading to competition for scarce resources. Improved coordination can lead to increased
effectiveness and efficiency of ECD programmes, sometimes with the same or even reduced resources.

2.2 Project Description
Building on previous projects at country level, this Project became the first regional project on ECD covering these
countries. In each country, the Project selected two to 26 municipalities to model ECD services and pre-primary
education (PPE) services, in addition to the advisory, advocacy and knowledge-generating work done on both
thematic areas (ECD services and PPE services) at the national level.
Project Budget
The total Project budget stood at 2,513,16 EUR, with ADA contribution totalling 1,799,999 EUR and UNICEF
contributing 713,117 EUR. The projected expenditures by category16 were:

Contribution to SDGs and gender equality
The Project outcomes and outputs related to:
- SDG 3 (Good health and well-being): the outcomes they aimed at improved health and development of
children
- SDG 4 (Quality education): inclusive, quality pre-primary education is the foundation for children to take full
advantage of further steps in formal education
- SDG 10 (reduced inequalities): the Project related to the situation of ethnic minorities and children with
disabilities who are often impeded to fully access their rights
- SDG 16 (Peace, justice and strong institutions): the Project invested in the normative and institutional
framework surrounding ECD
- SDG 5 (Gender Equality) as a cross-cutting issue.
The Project logframe envisaged several gender transformative results, in terms of access to health, social care and
child protection services and PPE for girls, especially for Roma girls who have lower access levels. Quantitative
Project targets were disaggregated by gender. The Project justification presented briefly how the situation and
experience of girls and boys with disabilities and/or from Roma communities may differ.
Project approach and structure as per the Project document
In the Project document, the ToC of the Project is formulated as such:
IF mothers, fathers and girls and boys from vulnerable groups (Roma, Egyptian, children with disabilities) benefit
from a) support for nurturing care, b) quality health services, c) early detection of developmental risks, delays and
disabilities and d) early intervention services and IF boys and girls from ethnic minority groups and children with
disabilities access quality, equitable and inclusive pre-primary education (PPE) THEN they will have improved
health and development and will be able to reach their full human potential.
In line with this, the Project document presented the structure of the Project as follows:
Outcome 1. “Mothers, fathers and girls and boys, including those from vulnerable groups (Roma, Egyptian, children
with disabilities), from the Project targeted areas benefit from support for nurturing care, quality health services,
early detection of developmental risks, delays and disabilities and early intervention services.” This outcome was
served by five outputs:
1.1. National and sub-national policies, and programs improved, and mechanisms strengthened to contribute to
realization of the human rights of boys and girls, particularly from marginalized ethnic minority groups and
children with disabilities and their families
1.2. Service providers enhanced knowledge and skills to support parents/caregivers for nurturing care, early
detection of developmental difficulties and early childhood intervention (ECI)
1.3. Improved and innovative support modalities/services for children and parents/caregivers are made available
14
in targeted municipalities (e.g., counselling services, home visits, public service facilities, parental workshops,
ECD centres, community based programs)
1.4. Early childhood intervention services for children with developmental difficulties and disabilities strengthened
and their availability expanded
1.5. Awareness of the importance of child development raised among the parents/caregivers with an intention to
increase demand for quality services.
Outcome 2. “The pre-primary education (PPE) in the Project targeted areas is more accessible and provides quality
services including for boys and girls from ethnic minority groups and children with disabilities.” This outcome was
served by one output:
2.1 Capacity of pre-primary education professionals (teachers, principals, psychologists, speech therapists,
volunteers) in the Project targeted areas, strengthened for respect for diversity and inclusive service provision.
In each country respectively, a tailored set of outputs was implemented according to objectives agreed by the
Government and UNICEF CO, based on feasibility and on the priorities of national policy documents:

Revisited structure and ToC of the Project
As per the Terms of Reference (ToR), the evaluation team revisited the ToC and formulation of the Project document
to check its validity and coherence during the inception phase. In agreement with UNICEF, the ToC and structure
of the project were reformulated as follows:
• At input level the Project mobilised various assets to implement activities and create new experiences,
processes, tools, knowledge and skills among direct beneficiaries, particularly decision makers and service
providers.
• At output level, these actions were intended to elicit changes in the interaction, capacities, attitudes and
actions of the direct beneficiaries (duty bearers and civil society organizations (CSOs)), guided by new
pieces of legislation, regulations and policies, and equipped with new tools and knowledge, in the field of
ECD.
• At outcome level, the outputs were intended to yield the new and/or improved services building on the
existing framework,
• At impact level, the project was expected to contribute to sustainable change for the rights holders
(children with disabilities, Roma children and their families/parents/caregivers, and possibly other
vulnerable children and families).
These impacts should in turn have contributed to the larger purpose of establishing a ECD system that would
positively affect child health, child development and education in the targeted areas and beyond. For more details
refer to Annex 2 – Theory of Change of the Project.

2.3 Project Stakeholders
The Project targeted immediate (Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) service providers, duty bearers from among
local and central level public institutions in the areas of health, social services and education) and final beneficiaries
(children with disabilities and their families and communities; Roma children and their families and communities;
other vulnerable children and their families and communities), further described below in the Stakeholder Analysis
section of this report in Annex 3.
The evaluation recognised the different groups of stakeholders and places specific attention to (a) the benefits
received by the stakeholders (b) the level of participation by the different stakeholders and (c) the communication
between the Project and its stakeholders. Distinction is made between two main types of stakeholders:
1. Duty bearers and service providers, who constitute the direct beneficiaries of the Project’s activities. For the
purpose of this evaluation, including this report, the expression “duty bearers” includes all three categories
below, unless otherwise specified. This category includes:
a. National-level duty bearers: line ministries, Parliament, state agencies, and learning institutions (such
as the faculties and training institutes in charge of initial and continuous training of health and social
services practitioners);
b. Municipal-level duty bearers: municipal councils and city halls, social care and child protection services,
health services and PPE services present at the municipal level, whether they are deconcentrated from
the national level, or pertaining to municipal administration (depending on the territorial administration
of the respective countries);
c. Other service providers engaged in the Project, including mostly CSOs focusing on ECD, and in some
cases local companies.
2. Rights holders, who constitute the end beneficiaries of the Project, as they are expected to benefit from the
services provided by duty bearers and service providers. This category incudes:
a. Children with disabilities, Roma children and other children facing vulnerabilities, who are the ultimate
beneficiaries of the Project;
b. Their parents, guardians, caregivers and wider families, who care for them. For the purpose of this
evaluation, the expressions “parents” or “parents and families” will cover this entire category, unless
otherwise specified.
3. UNICEF as the implementer and co-funder of the Project, including:
a. UNICEF ECARO, which handled donor relations, designed the overall ToC and framework of the
Project, and which supervised and administered the Project including overall monitoring and reporting;
b. UNICEF COs, which selected and designed the respective components and activities to be
implemented in the respective countries, and which implemented and monitored the Project in
partnership with national counterparts.
4. ADA as the donor, who validated the Project design and oversaw the monitoring of Project implementation. In
some cases, the Austrian Embassies were also engaged in exchange of information about the Project at country
level.
5. Other international partners engaged in ECD who have coordinated with the Project, because they have
implemented or may implement, or may finance ECD projects in the countries, including: WHO, UNFPA, other
United Nations Agencies, depending on the countries, the European Union, International CSOs, such as the
Open Society Foundation, and other bilateral embassies and development agencies.

3. PURPOSE, OBJECTIVES, USERS AND SCOPE
OF THE EVALUATION
3.1 Purpose
The purpose of the evaluation, as summarised based on the ToR and Inception Report is to:
- Inform the evaluation users for evidence-based decision making;
- Understand the effects of the Project on the direct/immediate, and when possible, final/end beneficiaries;
- Ensure accountability towards the donor, the UN governance bodies, and the beneficiaries (rights holders
and duty bearers) in light of the Project’s objectives, indicators and targets, and with regard to invested
assets;
- Provide opportunities for organizational learning.
The evaluation is therefore mostly summative (as relates to understanding the effects of the Projects and ensuring
accountability), but also to some extent formative (as relates to organisational learning and informed decision
making). The evaluation report and management response will be public, thus fulfilling UNICEF’s commitment to
transparency and accountability.
3.2 Objectives
The evaluation objectives, in line with the ToR, and complemented by the evaluation team, are as follows:
1. Provide an independent assessment of the performance of the Project in relation to expected progress;
2. To provide actionable recommendations for UNICEF on improving its work at country and regional levels
and on supporting the sustainability of the changes;
3. To identify good practices and innovative approaches, and provide lessons learned for UNICEF and actors
working toward improving social inclusion of Roma children and children with disabilities.
Consequently, the evaluation should serve its users to:
1. Meet the accountability requirements set forth in the Project document;
2. Learn from the Project’s performance and delivery of results;
3. Support future planning and decision making on ECD in the region;
4. Provide a basis for informed advocacy in the Project countries and beyond.
3.3 Evaluation users
The primary intended users of the evaluation results are:
− UNICEF ECARO
− UNICEF COs
− ADA
Secondary intended users are:
− Duty bearers including: Line Ministries; State agencies (e.g., national institutes); Municipal administration
(belonging to local self-governance) and deconcentrated State services at municipal level.
− Other United Nations agencies which are currently active in ECD and inclusion in the region, including:
WHO North Macedonia; UNFPA North Macedonia
− CSOs including: CSOs providing services to rights holders at local level; CSOs performing advocacy and
services to rights holders at national level.
− Rights holders including: Children with disabilities and Roma children in targeted municipalities;
Parents/caregivers involved in the parenting programme and home visiting programme.
18
3.4 Scope of the Evaluation
Programmatic and temporal scope
The evaluation covers all Project activities of UNICEF during the period from 01 December 2018 to 31 December
2021. The evaluation covers the input, output and outcome levels of the Project. The evaluation team took steps to
identify plausible impact and sustainability aspects of the Project, owing to the formative nature of the evaluation,
while bearing in mind the Project’s progressive and long-term approach toward impact.
Geographic scope
The evaluation covers activities conducted within the territory of the seven countries covered, at central government
level and in selected municipalities. Owing to the restrictions linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, evaluation activities
were carried out remotely, online.
Unit of analysis
In addition to the general Project planning and implementation, the evaluation made two “deep dive” analyses of
the changes triggered in Kosovo* and North Macedonia, chosen as a sample. Consequently, some of the evaluation
criteria will mainly draw on data from these “deep dive” countries.
Thematic scope
The evaluation focuses on ECD, including early detection of developmental risks, delays and disabilities, early child
intervention, parenting and PPE as central elements of the Project’s ToC.
Population groups covered
The evaluation primarily analyses the contribution of the Project to changes for immediate beneficiaries at the output
and outcome levels. It also makes some inroads into assessing the plausible changes for final beneficiaries, at the
impact level.
Immediate beneficiaries include, as duty bearers: national and local self-governance authorities/services in charge
of ECD and PPE services, primarily in the health, child protection, social services and education sectors. Final
beneficiaries include:
- In the short run: children with disabilities, Roma children and their parents/caregivers in the municipalities
targeted by the Project (addressed through impact-level analysis).
- In the long run: children with vulnerabilities and their parents in selected countries in ECARO (addressed
by analysing sustainability of the Project-induced changes).
4. EVALUATION METHODOLOGY
4.1 Evaluation Criteria
In conformity with the ToR, the evaluation is based on the OECD/DAC criteria of relevance, coherence,
effectiveness, impact, sustainability. These criteria were applied given the theory-based evaluation approach,
as detailed below and translated into evaluation questions, as presented in sub-chapter 4.2. More detailed
presentation of the approach to each evaluation criterion is found in Annex 1 – Evaluation Matrix.
Relevance: The evaluation examined relevance from the point of view of ToC, trying to establish the extent to which
the Project’s outputs in the ToC matched the issues they were supposed to address, as well as the assumptions
that were associated to those issues.
19
Effectiveness: The evaluation examines the extent to which the expected outcomes (as spelled out in reformulated
ToC) have been achieved, and whether the corresponding assumptions have materialized.
Impact: The evaluation looks at whether the Project strategies and approaches are plausibly contributing to the
improved experience of the rights holders, particularly the most vulnerable ones, at the impact level of the
theory of change.
Sustainability: The evaluation focuses on whether the key assumptions about the purpose of the Project are in
place, to ensure lasting benefits.
Coherence: The evaluation focuses on optimisation of the input level of the ToC, including activities, served by a
range of UNICEF assets. The evaluation further tests the internal coherence of the Project, and its coherence with
the strategic goals of UNICEF and the respective countries.
Gender, Human Rights and Leave No One Behind
As cross-cutting elements of the analysis, the evaluation tested to what extent the Project was based on a human
rights analysis, gender analysis, and whether it has led to gender transformative results within the ToC. The
evaluation mainstreamed gender throughout the evaluation, at sub-evaluation question level and at indicator level.
In particular, the evaluation assessed the existence and adequacy of gender analysis supporting the Project design
at regional and country level, analysed the extent to which the Project formulated and worked on explicit gender
transformative results, and checked whether gender-focused activities and monitoring practices took place during
implementation. Owing to the effects of inclusive ECD on women and girls, and the over-representation of women
among ECD practitioners, the evaluation had a high proportion of women among its respondents (86%) – but it
ensured that men were also represented in each category of respondents.
4.2. Evaluation questions
During the inception phase, the evaluation team adapted the evaluation questions proposed by the ToRs to the
reformulated ToC, with a view of streamlining the questions to achieve a strong match between the ToC and the
evaluation matrix, which is based on these evaluation questions. As a result, one key evaluation question was
identified per criterion, and several sub-questions were elaborated to delve into specific elements of each criterion.

The revised evaluation questions and sub-questions were matched with indicators, data sources, and data

report. The full Evaluation Matrix is presented in Annex 1.
4.3 Data Collection, Analysis, and Sampling
The evaluation follows the UNEG Norms and Standards as well as the UNEG Ethical Guidelines for Evaluation.17
Mixed quantitative and qualitative methods were used, with a primacy of qualitative methods.
The evaluation is based on two data sets:
• Evaluation universe data: this includes general data about the Project as a whole (including “deep dive”
countries, and other countries as well as regional-level and UNICEF-wide data), as well as interviews and
documents. Evaluation universe data was used to emit hypotheses in response to the evaluation questions,
based on information that applies to all or most countries and/or to the regional level. However, alone, this
type of data was not sufficient to respond with a confident level of certainty to most evaluation questions,
because there is limited access to data in most countries (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Moldova,
Montenegro, Serbia, which were not selected as “deep dive” countries), and since there was limited
time/capacity to investigate the realities of the field for the duty bearers and rights holders in these countries.
This class of data mostly provided insight on the output, outcome and impact levels of the ToC. It informed
the evaluation on the implementation of the activities and results achieved, changes that the beneficiaries
experienced, ownership of the results by beneficiaries and CSOs.
• “Deep dive” countries’ data: this includes data on Kosovo* and North Macedonia, which were sampled as
“deep dives”. The data gathered from these countries enabled the evaluation team to check the working
hypotheses that were elaborated based on the evaluation universe data analysis: this data was interrogated
by the field reality as experienced by Project implementers, ECD duty bearers, and rights holders. “Deep
dives” involve more data-intensive research, broad range of interviews and collection of documents beyond
the existing documentation produced during/by/for Project implementation.
17 <www.uneval.org/normsandstandards/index.jsp>, <www.unevaluation.org/ethicalguidelines> [10/10/2020].

4.3.1 Data collection
Interviews
Interviewing has been one of the key elements of the data collection during the evaluation. As proposed during the
inception phase, the interviews with UNICEF staff and partners were prioritised as professional respondents, while
“deep dive” countries as geographic scope.
All UNICEF Project staff have been interviewed during the inception phase, there was no sampling conducted.
Among duty bearers at national level, all national counterparts were interviewed in Kosovo* and North Macedonia
during data collection. Similarly, all CSO service providers (implementing partners) were interviewed during data
collection in Kosovo* and North Macedonia.
Among duty bearers at municipal level, interviewees were sampled according to municipal sampling, combined with
convenience sampling: all available duty bearers in the sampled municipalities were interviewed, as specified in the
stakeholder analysis.
Among rights holders (parents directly reached by the Project), the sampling was very restrictive: two-three rights
holders were interviewed per “deep dive” country. As it was stated in the Inception Report, the time and resources
allocated to evaluation did not allow for representative sampling. The rights-holder interviews were thus done for
illustrating potential change (or the lack thereof) experienced at the impact level, to provide insights into the potential
bottlenecks faced by the rights holders when accessing new or improved ECD services to families or PPE.
The interviewed rights holders were identified through convenience snowball sampling: they were proposed by the
CSO service providers. Parents who are part of the Roma community, and parents of children with disabilities were
both represented in this small group of interviewees. There is a risk of bias in the selection of rights holders by
service providers: this bias could only be partly mitigated by the communication with CSO service providers:
availability, access to phone/internet, and interest in participating in the evaluation. However, the consequences of
this bias were considered to be minimal since these interviews were meant for illustration purposes and not as the
key source data.
The evaluation team held a total of 73 interviews, distributed as follows:
• Kosovo*: 17 informants
• North Macedonia: 27 informants
• Other countries and regional level: 29 informants.
These included:
1. Interview with all relevant UNICEF staff (one joint interview per country and three individual interviews at
regional level),
2. Interviews with the donor and other international partners,
3. Interviews with national level duty bearers from among line ministries and agencies in the health, social
protection, child protection, and education sectors in the “deep dive” countries,
4. Interviews in the sampled municipalities in the “deep dive” countries, with current and/or former staff of
service providers and other relevant duty bearers in the health, social and pre-primary education sector,
and elected officials in the selected municipalities, rights holders (parents/caregivers who benefited directly
from the Project), local/national/international CSOs; international partners.
The breakdown for the “deep dive” countries is listed below:

Document collection and desk review
Comprehensive Project documentation and other relevant documentation represented the second basic source of
data. During the evaluation process, the evaluation team received from UNICEF:
1. The entire Project documentation, products of the Project (publications, reports, presentations, training
material, quantitative data, etc.),
2. Documents, reports and quantitative data from implementing partners.
In addition, it assembled:
3. Online resources and publications from United Nations and third parties,
4. National legislative, regulatory and policy framework, and additional documents in the sampled
municipalities (e.g., action plans, information material, etc.)
These documents were assembled for all the countries covered. The list of documents reviewed can be found in
Annexes 9 – Bibliography, and 10 – List of Project-generated documents reviewed.
4.3.2 Data analysis
To analyse the collected data, and respond to the evaluation questions, the evaluation team used contribution
analysis methodology, which addressed:
24
● What change was intended by the Project (based on the ToC);
● What changes can actually be observed on the ground and among the stakeholders in terms of knowledge,
skills, know-how, mobilization of tools, techniques and mechanisms, decision-making processes, content
of decisions, behaviour, attitudes, perceptions, experiences and initiatives;
● What changes can actually be observed in access to inclusive and quality ECD services for vulnerable
children (especially children with disabilities and Roma children) and their parents/caregivers and families;
● Whether the action fulfilled necessary preconditions for these changes;
● How, and to what extent, the Project contributed to the changes – with the acknowledgement that it may
not be the only contribution to this impact.
Each of these sets of questions were posed for each level of the ToC – graduating from inputs to purpose. At each
level, the analysis tested the ToC, its internal logic and assumptions. Simultaneously, analytically proving the
Project’s contribution to change became more challenging the higher the level of the ToC and the logical framework.
At the levels of inputs, outputs, and outcomes), the evaluation was able to demonstrate direct contribution to
changes. At the higher levels of the ToC (impact to purpose), the evaluations confidence level is lower - it
demonstrates plausibility of the Project’s contribution to change.
The data was analysed through an analytical grid structured around the evaluation questions, sub-questions and
indicators (see Annex 1 – Evaluation matrix). This grid provided an overview of the information extracted from both
the documents, which were reviewed, annotated and referenced according to the level of analysis (questions, sub-
questions, indicators), and interviews, which were annotated, and salient statements extracted to be attached to
the same levels, to identify typical respondent positions on each question, and the degree to which they conformed
or differed from one another.
The data analysis results, dispatched accordingly on the grid, allowed the evaluation team to have a ready overview
of the evaluation process and to also assess early on, whether the gathered data was sufficient for triangulation
(confrontation of three or more types of data). If the triangulation deemed impossible, the evaluation team took
remedial action, by soliciting additional data.
Based on the grid, the evaluation team prepared draft findings for each evaluation question, and triangulated data
for each draft finding. These results of the analysis formed the basis for this final report.
4.3.3. Sampling
Country sampling
The evaluation team conducted two “deep dive” analyses on Kosovo* and North Macedonia. In these countries,
the evaluation team conducted a broad range of interviews with all types of stakeholders, along with in-depth review
of documentation. The purposive sampling was based on the following criteria, examined in consultation with
UNICEF ECARO and COs:
• Representation of the Project document’s outputs (at outcome level in the reconstructed theory of
change). This criterion has to do with the diversity of interventions and thematic area of work in these
countries, as well as breadth of activities;
• Number of municipalities covered in the program and number of stakeholders engaged;
• Significance of the investment to the Project;
• Feasibility for the COs, especially against other ongoing evaluation/research/planning initiatives that were
occurring simultaneously.
Municipal sampling
Within the “deep dives”, the evaluation analysed changes at the municipal and community level. For this purpose,
it sampled municipalities in consultation with UNICEF COs, based on the following criteria:
25
• Municipalities both covered by the Project, and identified as demonstration municipalities as per
UNICEF’s overall strategic approach.18 This strategy defines four levels of intervention for UNICEF,
including demonstration municipalities where UNICEF interventions are modelled. These municipalities
combine:
o Feasibility of modelling (existence of entry points, in line with requirements for demonstration
municipalities);
o High number of communities identified as marginalized;
o Variety and extent of the needs identified among these communities.
• Representation of urban, rural and mixed municipalities;
• Coverage of all Project outputs (as per initial Project document’s ToC) implemented in the respective
country;
• Feasibility measured by access to informants and documents.

4.3.4 Limitations
The unfolding of the COVID-19 pandemic presented the evaluation team with some difficulties in access to
interviewees in the “deep dive” countries, as well as the duty bearers of ECD (in particular health services) and the
UNICEF COs. As a result, their capacity in terms of time and human resources to participate in the evaluation was
constrained.
This constraint was factored in the data collection design and alleviated by the utility-oriented evaluation approach.
Yet, since restrictions did not allow for in-person data collection, the depth of the data was limited, especially at
local level. The evaluation team significantly increased the number of online interviews as compared with the ToR
to compensate this limitation.
The timing of the evaluation was also challenging, since the interviews took place both during the winter season
holidays, and at a time when the “deep dive” countries faced a new peak in infections. As a result, many interviewees
were unavailable or unwell at the time, and interviews had to be rescheduled. However, only one interlocutor
declined the interview. Consequently, the data collection phase was extended, but the quality of interview data was
not affected.
Lack of regularly available disaggregated data has presented an obstacle in Project monitoring and reporting.
Administrative data (with rare exceptions) are not disaggregated per ethnicity or disability which severely limits its
use in reporting. Further, the impact of the pandemic inhibited collection of routine data in 2020. The evaluation
could therefore not rely on comparable data across countries and years, except for Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey
(MICS), where available, which is aligned with SDG targets and indicators and provides disaggregated data,
including by ethnicity.
Other limitations, in particular concerning attribution of broad changes to this relatively small Project, inherent to
most evaluations, were compensated by contribution analysis and a realistic choice of evaluation criteria and
questions. The quality of the interview data and the variety of people interviewed allowed to clearly identify changes,
causalities, and analyse plausible contributions, following the steps of a ToC-based analysis.
4.4 Ethical Issues and Considerations
Observance of the UNEG ethical standards by the evaluation team
The overall approach adhered strongly to the ethical guidelines of the United Nations system and UNICEF, which
27
are listed in Annex 9 - Bibliography. The evaluation adhered to UNEG Norms and Standards, and its overall
approach was grounded based on being impartial, credible, responsible, honest, and demonstrating integrity at all
stages to foster an independent evaluation of the highest quality standards. The evaluation team respected the
following principles throughout its engagement with UNICEF ECARO: (i) Respect for dignity and diversity; (ii) Fair
representation; (iii) Compliance with codes for vulnerable groups (e.g., ethics of research involving young children
or vulnerable groups); (iv) Redress; (v) Confidentiality; and (vi) Avoidance of harm. The evaluation team has
prepared and implemented an evaluation approach that meets the ethical evaluation obligations and principles as
described further. The evaluation team members did not have any conflict of interest and operated with
independence and impartiality throughout the evaluation.
Furthermore, the Evaluation Team’s ethical approach was informed by UNICEF’s Procedure for Ethical Standards
in Research, Evaluation, Data Collection and Analysis and in accordance with the UNICEF Strategic Guidance Note
on Institutionalizing Ethical Practice for UNICEF Research and UNICEF’s Child Safeguarding Policy. For external
ethical protocols, the Evaluation Team abided by UNICEF’s guidance on ethical principles and requirements.
The evaluation team chose the informants in consultation with UNICEF ECARO and COs. This selection followed
UNEG Code of Conduct for Evaluation in the UN system.19 The selection ensured representation of the evaluation
users and the various groups of stakeholders, as presented in Annexes 3 and 4. This representation had two
limitations, due to the COVID pandemic which limited access, as well as the time and budget of the evaluation
which reduced the feasibility of reaching out to large groups of informants, in particular among rights holders:
1. The duty bearers (State institutions in charge of ECD and inclusion), CSOs working on ECD and inclusions,
and the rights holders (parents reached by the Project) were interviewed only in the deep dive countries,
as it was not feasible to conduct such wide range of interviews in all seven countries.
2. For the same reasons, the evaluation could only reach out to five rights holders. The purpose of interviewing
rights holders, however, was not to obtain a representative sample, but rather to hear individual stories and
experiences which would illustrate and nuance the findings on impact, which were derived from other
interviews as well as from document analysis (in particular Project-made research with end beneficiaries).
As regards rights holders, the evaluation did not reach to children themselves, because, in ECD, the end target
group includes pre-primary school children: online interviews with such young children were considered to represent
a disturbance to the children which would have been unjustified by very limited additional information for the
evaluation. The evaluation team considered that the parents’, CSOs’ and duty bearers’ input represented a better
balance between the inconvenience posed to the interviewees, and the benefit for the evaluation.
In line with informed consent principles and confidentiality, interviewees were informed at the start of the interview
regarding the purpose of the evaluation, assurances of voluntary participation, and confidentiality of all responses.
The Evaluation Team applied the principle of “do no harm” – both for the evaluation team and evaluation participants
together with the standard ethical requirements of any evaluation data collection process.
The Evaluation Team did not use audio or video recordings of interviews All notes taken by Evaluation Team have
been stored in personal computers with password protection.
No compensation for participation in the evaluation process was provided. The Evaluation Team ensured that
informed consent protocols were verbal, to avoid signing of any type of printed forms that might put participants at
risk. For all interviews and group discussions, personal data, including contact details were stripped from the data
before it was shared to ensure further confidentiality. All interview notes from the evaluation team are kept
electronically on password encrypted computers. Any potential personal identifiers have been removed from the
data prior to analysis. Data analysis was carried out only by the evaluation team members to ensure confidentiality.
Data compiled in reporting was aggregated so that individual responses cannot be traced to specific locations or
individuals. Both quantitative and qualitative information will be maintained on evaluation team computers only until
the finalization of the report, at which time it will be deleted to further protect individuals from possible identification.

The research needed for this evaluation did not include any interaction with children.
Ethical Review Procedure
The inception report, including evaluation methodology, interview templates, and consent forms were submitted to
the UNICEF Ethics Review Board in parallel with the quality assurance procedure. Ethical approval was given on
22 January 2022 (see letter of approval and a letter of consent in Annex 6 – Consent Forms and Ethical clearance).
4.4 Quality assurance
The UNICEF ECARO Evaluation manager and ECD team first reviewed all draft evaluation deliverables (inception
report including data collection and data analysis tools; final report), following which the Evaluation Team amended
deliverables as required. UNICEF ECARO and COs then reviewed the second version of the deliverables for
comments, and the Evaluation team integrated their comments. The report was then reviewed by UNICEF-
procured, external quality assurance.
5. EVALUATION FINDINGS
5.1 Relevance
Evaluation question 1: To what extent did the Project design continuously respond to
the needs and aspirations of the rights holders and duty bearers?
Key Findings:
Finding 1: UNICEF applied their field knowledge, situational analysis and systems approach to the Project
design and implementation. This enabled the Project to continuously adjust to the needs and aspirations of the
stakeholders.
Finding 2: The approach to ECD supported by UNICEF, and the national normative frameworks, were mutually
reinforcing, which contributed to ensuring the Project’s relevance to national priorities both at the policy level,
and during implementation.
Finding 3: The Project had to balance differing emphases in targeting approaches between UNICEF and ADA
as the donor: while UNICEF promotes an inclusive, systems approach, ADA’s preference for targeting Roma
children and children with disabilities did not always correspond to local priorities. UNICEF and the donor jointly
succeeded in making necessary adjustments in the field to remain relevant to stakeholder’s needs.
Finding 4: The Project had a gender focus and conducted specific activities, but there was limited documentary
evidence that these activities were backed up by gender analysis.
Finding 5: UNICEF successfully adapted to most of the constraints imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic through
a redesign of the implementation modalities, although some services suffered or provision was delayed.
Finding 1 UNICEF applied their field knowledge, situational analysis and systems approach to the Project design
and implementation. This enabled the Project to continuously adjust to the needs and aspirations of the
stakeholders.

Interviews with UNICEF and duty bearers
Interviews with UNICEF staff revealed that the Project design and selected outputs in the respective countries was
informed by UNICEF’s field knowledge, and, stakeholder and context analysis of each country’s ECD systems.
This was underpinned by UNICEF’s prior, long-standing engagement in country and the previously generated
research products and data (MICS, earlier UNICEF studies and publications).
Partnerships pre-dated the Project, including with national-level institutions in the health, social protection, child
protection, and education sectors; devolved state-level services at the regional or local levels; and the local self-
governance at regional and municipal levels. UNICEF COs also have cooperated with civil society actors relevant
to ECD: at national levels, some CSOs had long been engaged as like-minded actors in advocacy efforts, while at
the local level they served as a longstanding source of child rights monitoring, as well as, in some cases,
implementing partners for certain services as a part of other UNICEF work.
It is clear from the stakeholder analysis sub-chapters of the Project documents, that UNICEF COs based their
engagement with CSOs on the analysis of previous partnership experiences in three areas: as service providers to
the target groups; as advocates for prioritisation and improvement of ECD services by duty bearers; and as
champions, representatives or advocates for certain vulnerable groups. It is also apparent from the interviews with
UNICEF, that the COs were aware of CSOs’ capacities and comparative advantages, and incorporated that
knowledge into the planning and implementation process.
Based on Project documents and country reports, UNICEF’s in-depth knowledge of local and municipal actors (both
public officials and CSOs) was particularly pronounced in communities and municipalities where UNICEF previously
implemented activities under other ECD programmes, or other programmes involving ECD actors. Such knowledge
was corroborated by the interviewed stakeholders in “deep dive” countries. To give an operational example, pilot
initiatives on social protection in Albania equipped the CO with an in-depth understanding of the actors and
dynamics in some of the pilot municipalities for the Project – and this understanding, as evidenced by interviews
with UNICEF and stakeholders, was transferrable to the Project, since social protection stakeholders are highly
relevant to ECD, particularly in ECI.
Quote (a duty bearer in North Macedonia) “The support we got from UNICEF and other United Nations agencies is
absolutely relevant for our country: the indicators on neonatal care were very bad, while the tertiary system had to
be reorganized. The solution of the Masterplan [elaborated with UNICEF support] defined what maternity hospitals
must have in terms of equipment and skills.”
UNICEF’s knowledge of the context included not only the formal roles envisaged for stakeholders by national
policies, legislation and regulations, but also the awareness of their real capacities in terms of institutional
development and available human resources, as well as of their motivations (structural incentives to engage and
invest efforts in cooperation with UNICEF and each other, political interests, etc.) and of their relationships (for
example the willingness to engage in partnerships, levels of mutual trust, etc.). This awareness was expressed
during the interviews, and also channelled into Project documents and reports.
30
Based on this knowledge, UNICEF created small-scale funding agreements with partner institutions wherever
necessary, containing an explanation on the established needs that require such additional support, as well as the
projected change sought in the discharge of duties in accordance with the legal framework.
UNICEF tried, wherever possible, to generate additional data for pinpointing the needs of the target groups. For
example, in Montenegro, the Project interventions focused mainly on Roma children, since MICS 2013 and 2018
data highlighted the heightened need for supporting this community. UNICEF adapted the 2013 and 2018 MICS to
generate data specifically on Roma children: this data served as a basis for a separate report on Roma settlements
in ECD context.20 This report complemented UNICEF knowledge based on direct work with the community, allowing
UNICEF to ensure programming and the respective governments’ policy documents21 addressed beneficiary needs.
Some Project country reports, Project outputs and internal reporting tools, as well as interviews conducted by the
evaluation team revealed the COs' ability to remain relevant to the beneficiary needs and the implementation context
through their agility in “fusing” the systems approach with in-depth stakeholder analysis. In practical terms, this
meant UNICEF was able to frame their understanding of the stakeholder interactions (between duty bearers and
end-beneficiaries, among stakeholders). UNICEF understood the context of the interplay between the various
aspects of the normative (legal, policy and institutional) framework, and their cumulative systemic impact on social
care, child protection, education and health.
For example, UNICEF identified how the evolution of the normative framework in related areas interplayed with the
development of the local self-governance: UNICEF systems approach enabled COs to anticipate devolution and
decentralisation of relevant responsibilities for ECD and inclusion. This approach allowed for a targeted cooperation
with the most relevant institutions at state and local levels in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, and North
Macedonia.
The complexity and granularity of this knowledge informed decision-making during the Project design and
implementation, and – as interviews testify – were crucial in offering participative, practical, and feasible solutions
to problems, and in adjusting the Project activities and outputs.
Several products developed by the Project exemplify this integrated analytical capacity and how it helped keep the
Project relevant:
- The Methodological Guide - Research for National Situation Analyses on Early Childhood Intervention22
includes a situational analysis which traces the most commonly observed transitional continuum of “Legacy
Services, Evolving Services, and Contemporary Services” in the countries of the Project. It investigates the
framework, personnel and users (as key stakeholders), and the characteristics of services provided. It then
applies the approach to ECI in a change-oriented fashion, which is a crucial element of keeping the
interventions relevant to stakeholder and beneficiary needs. Many practitioners interviewed in the “deep dive”
countries reported that they are using the Guide and are finding its insights very useful to guide their
interventions.
- Developmental Behavioural Scales used to assess children’s early development, in line with UNICEF and
WHO guidance were developed, and promoted in Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia, and Serbia.
They ensure the relevance of duty-bearers’ interventions to evolving needs of the end-beneficiaries.
- Situational analyses were prepared, for instance, in Serbia, serving as a formal tool for adjusting Project
interventions for relevance.
20 According to MICS, Roma and Egyptian children are considered the most vulnerable segment of the population, with 26.8% children
moderately or severely stunted, and almost 37% women aged 20-24 with at least one live birth before the age of 18. In Roma settlements, only
18.5% children 36-59 months were in early childhood education as compared to 39.9% of the general population. Forty percent of respondents
believed that children needed to be physically punished (55% mothers and 33% fathers), which was in line with the actual prevalence of physical
discipline.
21 For instance, see Montenegro National Strategy for Inclusion of Roma and Egyptians 2016-2020.

31
- Training sessions and modules, for instance, the modules for patronage nurses based on UNICEF regional
package for home visiting were developed and considered as particularly well-tailored by the stakeholders in
the “deep dive” countries.23 These materials mobilized context analysis to tailor the messages and practical
exercises.24
When taken together, extensive familiarity with the context and programmatic knowledge, complemented with the
ability to implement a evidence-informed systems approach, allowed UNICEF to ensure relevance of its
interventions. They also enabled the COs’ staff to contribute to the products and services selected by the Project,
and to select outputs that were better suited to each country context, which corresponds to one of the assumptions
of the reconstructed ToC.
Good practice: A project designed for enhanced – not new – ECD services ensures that interventions are
context-specific and not “one-size-fits-all”.
The project approach to ECD services, whether in the health, child protection and social sector, or in PPE, was
to enhance the quality, adequacy, targeting, access, and coverage of existing services – not to create new
services. This approach was based on context analysis.
The home visiting programmes with patronage nurses existed in all target countries before the Project. In several
cases, these had been developed with some support of UNICEF – such as advice, or facilitation of consultations.
Based on past experience, and assessing the development of this service, the Project aimed to boost these
programmes through the training of patronage nurses, facilitation of networking and referral between patronage
nurses and other actors of health and social integration (such as local health centres, hospitals, specialised
doctors, centres for social work and/or community-based social and resource centres.)
This approach avoided the traps of creating decontextualized, one-size-fits-all, donor-driven activity. It ensured
that the supported services would fit within the existing normative framework and would be better owned by the
stakeholders, because they were perceived as context relevant. A duty bearer from Kosovo* summarized: “We
did not start these interventions from scratch with this Project: they were a continuation of previous work (…) We
were able to expand our reach and increase our quality through the Project; and we knew exactly what we were
doing, and why we were doing it.”
Finding 2: The approach to ECD supported by UNICEF, and the national normative frameworks, were mutually
reinforcing, which contributed to ensuring the Project’s relevance to national priorities both at the policy level, and
during implementation.

Interviews with UNICEF staff, duty bearers
The interviews and reports demonstrate that UNICEF and the respective national partners engaged in extensive
discussions concerning the national priorities for each country and jointly identified the priority programmatic areas,
outputs and indicators to be covered by the Project in each country. Since the priority areas were jointly defined
and complemented the national policy agendas, the Project outputs were therefore highly relevant to the duty
bearers’ needs.
The feedback received in Kosovo* is illustrative: all stakeholders highlighted that Project design and planning was
a participatory process involving key government stakeholders. The relevant Ministries validated UNICEF plans
prior to their final approval. There was no need to adjust the selected outputs or the approach to ECD in any country
during the Project implementation phase, which is a testimony to the relevance of the participatory Project design,

and of the appropriate use of an “menu” of outputs for selecting the interventions most appropriate in each country
context.
Since UNICEF (over time and often for over a decade) and the Project (during Project design and implementation)
directly influenced the elaboration of national priorities and policies, these priorities and policies were fundamentally
aligned to the UNICEF approach. National policies were then further supported through the Project during
implementation. Fundamentally, the national policies have been influenced by and replicated the UNICEF
programmatic approach to a sufficient extent to ensure mutual alignment.
Quote (a duty bearer in Kosovo*) “UNICEF has oriented and conceptualised the way we perceived ECD.”
For example, the de-institutionalisation reforms, which have been practiced in the seven countries covered, are
aligned with UNICEF’s holistic ECD concept of engaging the health, child protection, social care, and education
sectors and actors. Such close alignment comes as no surprise since UNICEF has supported these policy reforms
over the past decade. For instance, in Albania, UNICEF programmes on social protection and on social care
services stem from de-institutionalisation in child protection and aim for social integration of vulnerable children,
families and communities, in line with the policy documents adopted over the past ten years. The Project stepped
in to reinforce this integrative approach with a focus on ECD, but it could build on the foundation laid many years
before.
Figure 2: Mutually reinforcing, multi-sector visions for ECD
In practical terms, the ECD approach promoted a multi-disciplinary approach and horizontal links among the
professionals of the three sectors, both at policy level and at the level of service delivery. Many Project activities
were designed to respond to this practical objective.
At the local level, the Project ensured the relevance of the activities to the local stakeholders’ needs in a comparable
manner. A good example is North Macedonia, where the Project supported the establishment of a national
assessment body for children and youth with disabilities with specialized assessment bodies at the regional level,
comprised of multi-disciplinary professionals. Likewise, the various training sessions’ attendance lists in all countries
show a balanced mix of health and social welfare professionals.25
Quote (a duty bearer in Kosovo*) “UNICEF was very dedicated in partnering and negotiating with municipalities
to address the needs and priorities of the children from the design phase. The Project design was informed by
those needs.”
The interviewed duty bearers noted that the supporting activities designed under the respective outputs were highly
25 For instance, the attendance lists of the trainings on the Developmental Behavioural Scales in Bosnia and Herzegovina show approximately
one third of professionals from local health centres, one third of professionals from local “Centres for Social Work”, and one third of professionals
from health and social institutions at cantonal (Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina) or entity (Republika Srpska) levels. The same trend was
observed in other countries and for other trainings.
33
relevant to their needs and to end-beneficiaries’ needs. This entailed constant interaction with a wide variety of
stakeholders at all level of governance. For instance, the Moldova Analytical Brief produced by Ecorys as part of
the Multi-Country Evaluation of the UNICEF Early Childhood Development response to COVID-19 in Europe and
Central Asia region (2022), noted the large number of stakeholders to be involved, both at national and at local
levels. During the interviews, UNICEF staff and the duty bearers noted that it is more challenging to match the
expectations of the multiplicity of duty-bearers at the local level than of the few decision-makers at the national
level. To ensure continuous alignment between Project and the national policies (in particular their implications at
local level), UNICEF needs to monitor their implementation. This is particularly challenging when all levels of
governance are involved. This challenge has been observed in this Project but is not specific to it: it is a documented
in other evaluations. For example, the Evaluation of UNICEF Albania Country Programme (2020) highlights: “there
are substantial challenges in ensuring and, importantly, demonstrating, implementation (…) at subnational levels.”
Lesson learned: Technical-level stakeholders would have benefited from knowing more about the wider
Project approach.
To retain the perception of Project relevance to the national ECD-related policies and on the rights holders
targeted for inclusion, there are benefits to informing the local and technical-level stakeholders of the wider
context, implications and expected impact of the Project more systematically and comprehensively.
Several stakeholders at the local level, or technical stakeholders at the national level, regretted that they were
not given full overview of the entire Project in their respective counties. Consequently, they did not always
perceive the relevance of the Project in its entirety in view of their national policy framework. They found that this
shortcoming led them to miss some opportunities to benefit from the Project results in line with national policies.
For instance, some stakeholders knew about only some trainings and materials but not about others. As a result,
they were not able to use all the Project-generated learnings that were relevant to them. Likewise, some
stakeholders did not know inclusion was a core objective of the Project, so they could not tailor some activities
to the target groups.
CSO representative explained: “We didn’t realise that this was part of a wider project dealing with children with
disabilities and Roma. If we knew, we would have provided support in a different way”; “We lacked the overall
picture of the Project to tailor the training and to implement more specific tasks directed to children with disability
and Roma children. Our training didn’t have a focus on disability issues. Had we had this wider frame and sense,
we might have included other aspects in the curricula.” Similar sentiments were expressed by others in different
countries.
Finding 3: The Project had to balance differing emphases in targeting approaches between UNICEF and ADA as
the donor: while UNICEF promotes an inclusive, systems approach, ADA’s preference for targeting Roma children
and children with disabilities did not always correspond to local priorities. UNICEF and the donor jointly succeeded
in making necessary adjustments in the field to remain relevant to stakeholder’s needs.

Secondary data
UNICEF ECARO initiated the Project idea and reached out to ADA, which then invited a full project proposal. This
proposal needed to match ADA guidelines on reduction of inequalities, relevant to its applicable strategic Three-
Year Programme - priorities 1 and 5 regarding poverty reduction and inclusive societies.26 It also had to be in line
with the ADA regional strategy, in particular its cross-cutting issue on social inclusion, and its component on
governance and human rights prioritizing “marginalized groups such as ethnic minorities, Roma and people with

34
disabilities”.27 The donor’s overarching intervention approach in middle-income countries is to address inequalities
for both poverty reduction and inclusion of left-behind groups. Conceptually, this guidance is fully in line with
UNICEF guidance and leave-no-one-behind principle, and it is relevant to the situation in the region where poverty
is not widespread while inequality is high.28
Quote (a donor representative)
“Poverty reduction and leaving-no-one-behind are dealing with the inequality topic from two complementary
directions, we try to reconcile them.”
Although theoretically sound, this approach is not always easy to reconcile in practice. The choice of these groups
as targets for special assistance must be based on the objective estimation of their vulnerability. There is ample
research documenting the inequalities experienced by the Roma and other minorities. But the countries covered by
the Project lack comparable disaggregated data, which would document the extent to which the inequalities, which
the leaving-no-one-behind approach seeks to address, affect particularly children with disabilities and Roma
children.
This shortcoming has been identified by interviewees from UNICEF and ADA. The country reporting, and in the
documentation examined29 show that while gender disaggregation is done more systematically, disaggregation is
not systematically practiced in national statistics for the target groups of children with disabilities or Roma children.
This happens either due to the lack of capacity or because such disaggregation is perceived as labelling. In Kosovo*,
several interviewees stressed that the home visiting programme were meant as a service “for all, individualised”.
While they did support the inclusion of the target groups (because their special needs are a reality), they sometimes
considered that other groups faced similar challenges to inclusion. Some wondered whether there was sufficient
evidence to justify that the Project would target them over other minorities.
The national counterparts noted several times that they fully subscribe to the UNICEF approach, that there must be
universal access to ECD community/in-house services and PPE based on individual rights and needs. They did
question, however, whether the Project’s targeting of Roma children was fully warranted. In some cases, they
considered that Roma children have already been targeted by the national normative framework and the
implementation of these policies is continuous and ongoing for years: in North Macedonia the Project focused on
Roma integration in neonatal care reforms, while the inclusion of Roma in education institutions, including PPE
institutions, have continuously been part of the education reform since 2012 through Roma Decade and various
projects focusing on Roma inclusion. UNICEF further advocated to ensure the Project target groups (Roma children
and children with disabilities) would be specifically mentioned as priorities in the policy framework, which was being
elaborated.
In several locations, the country reporting shows that the Project had to extend its outreach to other groups with
particular needs: this is the case for minority or returnee communities and underserved/poorer municipalities in
Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo*. According to the interviews and the documents, the donor supported such
adjustments, which ensured sufficient flexibility for adjusting to local needs and priorities.
Quote (a CSO representative in Kosovo*)
“The priorities of the Project addressed exactly what was needed in these communities: in these municipalities,
which cover large territories, the Kosovo* institutions could not ensure these services prior to the Project.”
The Project also adjusted its approach locally to maximize the targeting of children with disabilities and Roma
children through selecting municipalities with large Roma communities for the piloting of enhanced services.

Interviews and country reporting showed that this approach was often considered relevant by the national and
municipal authorities because the territorial selection eased the argumentation of need: while the disaggregation by
target group may not be available, the territorial inequalities are usually clearly documented by the national data.
Such approach was also supported by CSO counterparts.
The budgetary setup of the Project, which was allocated by output (previously agreed with the donor, and
stakeholders), rather than tied to the activities, helped facilitate such adjustments, since the funds were not
earmarked for a particular target group or municipality.
Finding 4: The Project had a gender focus and conducted specific activities, but there was limited documentary
evidence that these activities were backed by gender analysis.

An important element of relevance is a Project’s ability to consider the different situations of men/boys and
women/girls in relation to the problem addressed by the Project and in terms of the expected changes. This
supposes a gender analysis, which in turn needs to inform a tailored approach to both genders, and the linkage to
gender transformative results (i.e., results which help change the inequalities between genders with regard to the
problem addressed, in this case ECD).
The Project implemented several activities focused on gender transformative results, such as gender socialisation
modules, as well as components of the parent application and practitioner trainings dedicated to violence against
women and domestic violence. Most activities which addressed mothers and childcare were by nature directed at
mothers, and plausibly had a gender equality and women empowerment vision by improving mothers’ situation.
Gender equality and women’s empowerment was also mainstreamed in other activities. As an illustration, the
consulting firm Ecorys reports, in the Analytical Brief on Moldova prepared in 2021 focusing on the Project: “Gender-
sensitive content was incorporated into the trainings. During the sessions the importance of fathers engaging in
their child’s education was discussed and fathers were encouraged to play active roles in this process. As per the
Key Informants, messages about the need to reduce the burden of care on the female caregivers was
communicated to the participants. In a context where a fathers’ engagement in their child’s early education is limited,
all interviewees assessed this content as highly relevant.”
Quote (a CSO representative in North Macedonia):
“Our CSO has been working on the Helpline for parents’ services to improve their parental skills. In practice, this
is mainly for mothers, because fathers are less interested in participating. One of our target groups are socially
deprived mothers and Roma mothers. Our organisation has expertise working with women who survived family
violence.”
However, the activities which focused on gender transformative results were not based on elaborate gender
analysis as a part of the Project documents and reports. The Project documents and Project reports, while
acknowledging the importance of gender mainstreaming, gender equality and the empowerment of women, do not
go much beyond general considerations. They do not analyse the different consequences, for men/boys and
women/girls respectively, of the problems which the Project intends to tackle. They do not analyse the root causes
of the different situations of men/boys, and women/girls with regard to ECD. They do not present the different
impacts of inequities, disability, or the COVID pandemic for men/boys and women/girls. The evaluation team could
not identify any evidence of such gender analysis in the Project documentation.
36
Interviews with UNICEF revealed that COs and ECARO did produce extensive gender research and analysis
relevant to Roma children and families, as well as children with disabilities, under other projects or as a part of their
regular, five-year country analysis. In addition, all COs produced gender analysis for their respective Country
Programme Documents, in relation with their respective priorities. Most COs also had implemented other projects
and prepared gender analysis for the purpose of other projects, or as background for the Country Programmes,
which could have been relevant (at least in part) to this Project. Finally, various external sources of evidence exist
on the different experiences of women/girls and men/boys in relation to the various ECD services. However, this
evidence was not explicitly channelled into the programme document or in the respective countries’ progress
reports, including in the analytical sections and demonstrated in gender transformative results.30 The final Project
report corrected this gap at the end of the Project by channelling some of these research results and updating the
gender analysis already conducted in country programme documents or other projects.
Lesson learned: Gender analysis needs to be integrated into the project design and documentation in
order to fully deliver gender transformative results.
There are indications that deeper, more systematic gender analysis is needed to inform the Project design, but
also to report on the gender transformative results of such projects. Interviews suggest that the situation of
men/boys and women/girls with regard to ECD, their role in ECD, and their interest in change, may be profoundly
different. Future interventions would be better supported if the existing analysis was complemented with updated,
project-specific gender analysis informing explicit gender transformative results. This should be feasible because:
- UNODC Country Programme Documents (and other projects) already include solid gender analysis on
the thematic priority areas of UNICEF, including areas related to ECD;
- There usually exists gender-disaggregated data in MICS and to some extent in national statistics;
- All countries covered have a wealth of expertise among practitioners, both in civil service and among
CSOs.
Finding 5: UNICEF successfully adapted to most of the constraints imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic through
redesign of the implementation modalities, although some services suffered, or provision was delayed.

The COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected the implementation of this Project since many Project activities
(training, community and parent workshops, home visits, services in PPE children’s groups) were planned for in-
person interaction. In addition, the Project’s national partners were at the heart of the COVID-19 response. This is
particularly true of health professionals, but is also applicable to practitioners in the education, child protection and
social care sectors. National health agencies, who were key Project partners in early identification and ECI, have
performed unprecedented tasks and assumed exponentially increased responsibilities. Working with already
stretched human and financial resources, they were facing a daunting task and prioritized COVID-19 response.
Quote (a duty bearer from North Macedonia):
“The pandemic has badly affected the capacity of the health sector. The capacity of health workers is small, they
are very stretched.”
All Project partners maintained engagement in planned Project activities and to support the Project’s adaptation to
the pandemic. They have demonstrated their commitment to a common vision of ECD by making considerable

efforts for continuing Project implementation under challenging circumstances. UNICEF, in turn, accompanied
these changes by redesigning some activities, adjusting their modalities to move them online, and providing
hardware and software where necessary. In North Macedonia, the Project provided the necessary electronic tablets
to its partners. It supported the use of Eduino, an online system designed by UNICEF through another project. PPE
stakeholders found these well-tailored and satisfactory, as evidenced by interviews and by a satisfaction survey
conducted by the Project with its beneficiaries in North Macedonia. In Kosovo*, UNICEF designed an online ECD
platform for ages 0-6, which targets preschool (0-5) and pre-primary (5-6) aged children, parents/caregivers, and
educators. The Project produced guidelines on “tele-health”. The Project operated this transition in a participatory
manner with its State, local governance and CSO partners: many products such as the Bebbo parent application,
ECD platforms, training modules and guidance materials, were adjusted in this fashion.
Quote (a duty bearer from Kosovo*):
“UNICEF helped us to create the content for the ECD platform. They were very flexible during the pandemic,
aligning their actions to the changing needs.”
Operationalizing the adaptations to COVID-19 in a quality manner required time, but this was the correct decision:
all interviewees considered it a worthwhile investment and found that it was more important to ensure the relevance
and functionality of online products, rather than rush online implementation. As a result, most activities were
implemented, even if they were delayed, or until the re-establishment of the necessary conditions on the ground –
as was the case for workshops with parents/caregivers in Roma settlements, for instance. The example of Moldova
is enlightening:31 the Project helped identify the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic to the
parents/caregivers, who were “unprepared to provide young children with learning opportunities and reduce screen
time” in a context where “the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic created considerable barriers to accessing
education for the youngest children and their families.” The Project reacted: “With the introduction of online sessions
on positive parenting to the caregivers of young children, the intervention responded to the caregivers’ need for
guidance on organizing learning activities for their children at home.” Donor flexibility was instrumental to ensure
that these adjustments were made.
Quotes (UNICEF representatives):
“With the pandemic, we realized that the contract would not be implemented face-to-face as planned. So, we had
to transfer training and all materials online. We spent almost a year to change the original concept and move
online.”
“Due to the heavy workload in the health sector, intermittent pre-school and school closures, and nation-wide or
local-level lockdowns, some of the Project activities were delayed during 2020 (e.g., workshops in Roma
settlements on health education have been postponed), while others could continue with or without modifications
(home visitation and promotion of early learning). Project strategy adapted so that outreach to Roma families can
continue in 2021 despite the persisting pandemic.”
The Project partners from State and local self-governance institutions actively accompanied these adjustments. For
example, they promoted the Project-made guidance and provided additional instructions which facilitated:
- The nurses’ interaction with parents/caregivers on smartphone or tablet to replace home visits for neonatal
care and ECI for children with disabilities and their families;
- The social workers’ parental support by the phone;
- The organisation of online trainings for PPE professionals;
- Online modules and publications for parents/caregivers on parenting under COVID constraints.
Good practice: Embracing the externalities of the adaptation to COVID-19 pandemic can led positive
effects, such as increased coverage.
Moving online enabled the Project partners to scale up some activities because once the software and modalities
are developed, and if participants have the minimum necessary equipment, online interaction only has marginal
costs. The Project aptly took charge of the initial costs and kick-started these online activities – a form of
31 Ecorys for UNICEF, Analytical Brief # 3 Moldova, 3rd Rapid Assessment Cycle, August, 2021.
38
investment – whereas partners in the countries (including contracted CSOs) ran the activities at a very low cost.
This shows that a relevant and tailored adaptation to the COVID-19 pandemic can expand the circle of Project’s
beneficiaries. In other cases, the savings caused by shifting to online modalities enabled partners to multiply the
venues and offer individual, rather than group services.
For instance, in North Macedonia, once UNICEF equipped the PPE institutions with IT equipment, 40% more
PPE staff than initially envisaged were trained. Group parental support meetings were conducted as envisaged,
but were then supplemented by individual, and therefore more tailored, support meetings.
A duty bearer in North Macedonia reported: “With the support of UNICEF, we have developed free-of-charge
services for individual parents, in addition to the group support service. At the beginning the interest was small,
but after strong promotion campaign we have had more beneficiaries each month.” This interest shows how the
new services developed to adjust to the pandemic were relevant to the needs.
Overall, resilience to COVID-19, which was an assumption of the reconstructed ToC, was mostly met. Still, some
activities still suffered - especially counselling and mentoring services. Some services, such as mentoring in PPE
institutions, were not transferrable online since they depend on the children’s group environment: the interviewed
duty bearers and UNICEF reported that mentoring activities were interrupted during the closure of all educational
institutions, and the Project ended before the necessary conditions could be met again.
Likewise, counselling services to Roma children and children with developmental challenges was not possible:
online interaction could not provide the appropriate level of depth for generating relationships of trust with children.
Roma settlements were particularly difficult to reach during the pandemic since their internet access is very limited:
access to high-speed connections is low, financial means are lacking for procuring the equipment, and often
purported users lack familiarity with the equipment. In North Macedonia, the Project used existing Roma community
mediators to conduct on-site, in-person visits, which was a context-relevant adjustment, but this could not fully
replace the visits of social and health workers.
Many interviewees, in particular nurses and social workers, found that transitioning online, while relevant to the
constraints imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic placed a heavier burden on the families. A duty bearer in North
Macedonia explained, “We still miss good counselling services for the children: currently, due to the pandemic, all
support goes online through the parents.”
5.2 Effectiveness
Evaluation question 2: To what extent has the Project contributed to the realisation of the
expected changes?
Key Findings:
Finding 6: Inputs from UNICEF contributed to inform, with evidence and guidance, the national policy and legal
documents adopted during the Project period, though the direct effect of this contribution on policy seems to have
been more substantial than on legal and regulatory aspects.
Finding 7: The Project contributed to the establishment of networks of committed professionals, building of their
skills, and reinforcement of conducive cooperative mechanisms. This in turn contributed to improving the
accessibility and inclusiveness of ECI, ECD and PPE services.
Finding 8: The practitioners included in the Project display a change of attitudes, and they increasingly use the
skills promoted through the Project. This has a direct effect on the quality (particularly the inclusive character) of
ECD and PPE services.
Finding 9: The monitoring and reporting mechanisms of the Project made progress towards effectively establishing
the baseline and tracking Project efforts, although overall successes were hampered by the data gaps at national
and local levels.

Policy, legislation and by-laws in “deep dive” countries
MICS
In the “deep dive” countries, the evaluation team analysed the policy documents (national strategies and action
plans), legislation, and regulations adopted during the Project timeline. This was completed by a review of country-
level reporting and interviews with UNICEF staff. This analysis has demonstrated that many of these documents
channel, at least in part, the knowledge produced by UNICEF (research publications and guidance produced by
this and other projects), and the approach to ECD promoted by UNICEF.
Typically, policy documents quote UNICEF data, such as MICS statistics or data gathered jointly with national
authorities for the purpose of a publication or background analysis. They also use some of UNICEF’s ECD
vocabulary. Most importantly, they tend to promote a holistic approach to ECD – the triangle of health, social
care/child protection and education – and a child-centred approach based on supporting the realisation of the
children’s potential, rather than the past “curative” or “palliative” approach to “defects”. Some policy documents
introduce new indicators based on UNICEF-promoted standards of services. For instance, new legislation and
regulations on early identification require the practitioners to identify, along with development challenges, the
strengths of the child and how their family can support them.
The newly adopted normative documents sometimes explicitly target children with disabilities and Roma children
as priority groups, but not as separate groups. They depart from a logic of separated care for the target groups and
adopt an integrative approach. Additionally, they take a proactive outreach approach towards the most vulnerable
and the most underserved, which denotes the adoption of a leaving-no-one-behind principle. For instance, in
Kosovo*, the draft Law on Early Childhood Education foresees the creation of community-based ECD resource
centres – distinct from the “institutionalisation” policies, which prevailed in the past. Likewise, in North Macedonia,
separate schools were turned into community PPE and primary education resource centres. The channelling of the
concepts and standards promoted by UNICEF was made possible because key policy makers became convinced
of their value. Interviews in “deep dive” countries show the buy-in for UNICEF-promoted models.
Quote (a duty bearer in North Macedonia)
“We decided to transform schools for children with special educational needs into resource centres for inclusive
education. Children need to be involved in regular schools. UNICEF supported this reform.”
Quote (a duty bearer in Kosovo*)
“The community-based models are a very good alternative for children who could not previously access ECD
services. Bringing the services to the child, to the family, to the community – all of that, we decided to
institutionalise it by bringing it into the new law.”
Legislative and regulatory documents adopted during the lifetime of the Project delineate clearer responsibilities
than before, and they typically envisage cooperation between the three sectors. They often reflect some of the
standards of services promoted by UNICEF, such as early identification assessment scales. They sometimes
formalise the workflows and types of services piloted with the support of the Project. However, the inherited
delineation of roles among the line ministries is not easy to supersede with a holistic, inter-ministerial approach.
Lesson learned: To the extent possible, formal groups of ECD professionals (e.g., working groups) need
to reflect the holistic policy approach in cooperative working arrangements.
In some cases, the holistic ECD approach professed in policy documents is not fully transferred into the legislative
40
and regulatory framework. This is the case, for instance, of some by-laws regulating the appointment, role and
functioning of working bodies specialised in ECD. Because these by-laws are often the responsibility of one line
ministry, which does not have the capacity to instruct the staff of other line ministries, such regulatory documents
sometimes create obligations only for one type of practitioners, which can diminish the scope for horizontal
cooperation, and endanger the practical implementation of the holistic approach to ECD.
For instance, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the composition of the Federation’s “Working group for the revision of
the Rulebook on professional continuous development of professionals in the field of early detection, diagnosis,
intervention and follow up of development and other disorders impacting the growth and development of children
in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina” includes almost exclusively health professionals, supported by one
lawyer and one psychologist – but no social care professionals. This can be explained by the fact that this working
group was appointed by the Minister of Health. An inter-ministerial undertaking could have gathered a more holistic
range of professionals. Even if the Rulebook is meant for health professionals chiefly, inputs by social care
practitioners could have benefitted its contents.32
The evaluation team randomly sampled normative documents to check whether the Project staff and experts had
contributed to their elaboration and found that UNICEF was engaged in all of them. However, there is a concern
that most of the documents directly influenced by the Project belong to the policy, rather than the legal sphere (laws
or regulations), which could suggest that more efforts are needed to solidify the commitments by creating positive
obligations for the duty bearers.

The contribution of the Project to the normative framework is due to several enabling factors. One is the direct
involvement and consultation of UNICEF and experts in national consultative mechanisms for policy-making and
law-drafting within the Executive (inter-ministerial working groups and line ministries in particular). The willingness
of the national level duty bearers to involve UNICEF owes, in turn, to the organisation’s long-lasting engagement,
often for one or two decades, with these actors, as a partner, and more generally as an advisor and a facilitator in
consultative processes.
Another enabling factor is the resilience of the Project and Project-promoted partnerships in the face of external
turbulences. During the lifetime of the Project, all seven countries have experienced national elections, often with
long periods of political uncertainty. For instance, in Moldova, in 2021, the newly elected President had to exhaust
the constitutional options to form a government, leading to anticipated parliamentary elections. In Bosnia and
Herzegovina, it took particularly long negotiations before the government was formed. Turnover of decision-makers
also took place in Kosovo*. In addition, all countries were severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Despite these challenges, the Project continued to be implemented because the COs:
- Maintained close contacts with the technical level and the practitioners when the political and policy levels
were affected by turnover or political uncertainty;
- Built their image as honest, impartial and expertise-based partners to nurture partnerships with new
incumbents from new political majorities;
- Adjusted the timing and the type of partnerships and modalities to the constraints experienced by the duty
bearers.
This is one of the key assumptions of the ToC which has realised, and which in turn has enabled, to continue
working successfully on the normative framework on ECD in all countries.
Finding 7: The Project contributed to the establishment of networks of committed professionals, building of their
skills, and the reinforcement of conducive cooperative mechanisms. This, in turn, contributed to improving the
accessibility and inclusiveness of ECI, ECD and PPE services.

The Project has been effective in contributing to creating in each of the countries a critical mass of networked
professionals who share a common commitment to ECD, and have compatible skills and vision for ECD in their
respective fields of work.
This was primarily achieved through the series of formal trainings for ECD professionals in the health, child
protection/social care and PPE fields.33 The training materials covered nurturing care, early detection, early child
intervention, and PPE. According to the final Project report, the Project exceeded all its targets for training of PPE
professionals, patronage nurses and medical doctors. In some countries, the number of professionals trained in a
given area of work (such as home visiting, PPE, etc.) is very significant in view of the overall size of the sector. For
instance, in Moldova, the Project trained 81% of the didactical staff working in PPE on inclusive PPE services.
In addition to the trainings directly delivered by the Project, interviewees report cascade trainings and reproduction
of experiences. For instance, in North Macedonia alone, national authorities report that about 500 pedagogical
assistants who already work in the primary and secondary education system serve as a model for the impending
establishment of a similar service in PPE, while the PPE institutions supported by the Project have institutionalised
peer-to-peer support.
Secondly, the Project contributed to the adjustment of the institutional arrangements for and around these trained
professionals, so that they are enabled to practice their new skills and operate in a multi-disciplinary manner. For
instance, in Moldova, the Project resulted in the approval of 27 adjusted job descriptions for a wide range of ECD
professionals in Chisinau municipal administration: this is essential because legislation and regulations often remain
unimplemented due, among others, to the lack of harmonisation in the functions of the relevant professionals. This
is especially true as regards horizontal cooperation in multi-disciplinary, cross-sectoral policies.34
Thirdly, the Project supported these professionals to initiate or broaden both formal and informal networks within
each country. The Project directly supported the establishment of formal multi-disciplinary bodies, which form
operational networks specialised in early identification and early child intervention. This was instrumental in ensuring
coverage beyond capital cities. It also provided the conditions for horizontal cross-fertilisation between both
components of the Project – an important assumption of the reconstructed ToC.
Quote (a duty bearer in North Macedonia)
“The establishment of a body for the functional assessment of children with disabilities is a national priority. A lot
has already been done together with UNICEF. So far, more than 50% of the local functional assessment
commissions have been opened throughout the country.”
There are also good examples of less formal networks of professionals, for instance the networking of health and
social work centre practitioners working on ECD in Montenegro. The Project also exposed CSOs and duty bearers
to each other at the local level, building positive precedents of cooperation.
Quote (a CSO in North Macedonia)
33 Note that the project in Kosovo* did not distinguish PPE professionals (pre-primary education including ages 5-6 only), but rather included
educators for children aged 3-5 years old as well (preschool education). However, for the sake of convenience, this report refers to all relevant
professionals as PPE professionals.

“Educators from preschools often call our colleagues in [our CSO] to ask for assistance, because they know we
are well connected into the community. We know whom to call if there is a problem. We are a resource, both for
the Ministry and for the preschools.”
However, the Project did not succeed to put regional networks in place due to constraints related to the COVID-19
pandemic, as well as time and resource constraints.
An advantage of a regional project is the opportunity to create regional peer-to-peer networks of like-minded
professionals focusing on the same issue. Regional programmes make this possible because they implement
similar activities with similar objectives at the same time in all countries covered, and because they establish
partnerships with institutions and CSOs that share similar mandates. However, regional networking of peers was
not a prominent ambition of the Project. It does not explicitly appear in the logframe. The Project proposal and
Project reporting remains very country-specific: while there is a common blueprint of outcomes and outputs,
implementation resembled more a series of national projects based on a common core model than a regional project
with regional-level objectives. This was a realistic decision, but also meant that a key assumption of the
reconstructed ToC on cross-fertilisation was not realised.
In practice, the Project has shown that establishing regional networks require:
- The existence of a critical mass of professionals networked in the respective countries. The Project has
contributed to this result, but it is only now starting to function.
- That these professionals have already experimented with new schemes and new skills, and that they have
identified challenges and good practices. This is too early to be the case.
Therefore, while the Project has created the necessary conditions for a productive regional network, its timeframe
did not enable it to reach this stage. In addition, the COVID-19 constraints have prevented the organisation of in-
person regional meetings. While such networks can continue to operate online regionally once they are well
established, it is difficult to jumpstart and create the bonds and trust necessary for peer-to-peer regional support
online. UNICEF therefore waited for an alleviation of these constraints. UNICEF reported that such meetings are
starting now.
Finding 8: The practitioners included in the Project display a change of attitudes, and they increasingly use the skills
promoted through the Project. This has a direct effect on the quality (particularly the inclusive character) of ECD
and PPE services.

The practitioners from duty-bearer institutions interviewed by the evaluation team have all reported changes in their
own, and their colleagues’ attitudes. Several interviewees from PPE institutions in “deep dive” countries
encapsulated it when praising “the emotional learning” they had through the Project. However, there is no evidence
to check whether such changes are generalized: rather, there are anecdotal signs suggesting that the Project has
generated some attitude changes among some professionals.
Quote (a duty bearer in North Macedonia)
“The most important [in the Project] is the everyday professional support we get through the experts. They give
us ideas, they help with plans, with the implementation process, they strengthen the capacity of our staff.”
These changes are characteristic of champions of change in transitioning institutions: they involve and increase in
the self-confidence of dedicated professionals, and in turn a more forward leaning and proactive attitude. For
45
example, in Serbia, interviewees reported that field-level social workers and nurses tend to demand more feedback
from their peers, supervisors, and users. In other words, the trainings and mentoring and supported duty bearers
are more empowered with their ECD roles. Thanks to this empowerment, practitioners feel more confident about
confronting and matching their competences with those of other professions: they are readier to implement a
holistic, multi-disciplinary approach which corresponds to the vision of ECD promoted by UNICEF and by the
applicable national policy documents. This ability is a precondition to adopt an inclusive approach to the provision
of ECD services, based on the objective needs and challenges faced by each individual child. Interviews,
implementing partners (CSOs) reports, and UNICEF country-level reporting provide many illustrations of the
dialogue, which now happens between health professionals, social workers, and education professionals. This
change was also observed by interviewed CSOs and international actors, and it was confirmed by officials involved
in supervision. A considerable number of quotes from interviews illustrates this trend.
Quote (a duty bearer in Kosovo*)
“I learned so much about child development in these trainings! My professional background as a nurse was very
medical. Now I feel I am more competent to view child development holistically, not just from a medical
perspective.”
The presence of some champions of change, ready to promote the new models, is confirmed by the speed with
which the cascade training sessions were implemented by the newly trained personnel (training of trainers model).
For instance, in Kosovo*, after 18 national trainers were trained, 50 health professionals were retrained, which is a
very good ratio in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and bearing in mind the limited availability of health
professionals.
Another change in attitudes of some duty bearers concerns their relation to the supported children and
parents/caregivers. This change has emerged among some interviewees through training and through the
modelling of enhanced services. The modelling created positive experiences of a different type of relationship with
the rights holders. Although this result was adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the inability to have
face-to-face interaction, the interviewed parents/caregivers, pre-primary educators, nurses and social workers
describe a closer, friendlier relationship which is more:
- Need-based: interviewees in the field report that they depart from a diagnostic approach based on large
categories to increasingly assess the specific needs and unique situation of every child and family. This is
particularly true as regards children with disabilities at home, and both Roma (or other minority) children
and children with disabilities in PPE institutions.
- Child- and family-centred: focused on the potential of the child and oriented towards what they, the family,
and other actors can do together to help develop and realize this potential (according to several duty
bearers, CSOs and parents interviewed).
However, there is insufficient evidence to assess whether these changes are incidental or more widespread.
Quote (a duty bearer in North Macedonia)
“We learned through the training to better assess the challenges of the children. Now with the parents, we try to
find common ground for the child and to openly talk about the challenges. We try to help now, where there is a
way to help.”
A manifestation of this transformed attitude is found in supported PPE institutions in the “deep dive” countries, which
report using new pedagogical skills that require a nurturing and confident attitude. With play-based, project-based,
and motivation-based techniques they include previously excluded children into the group’s learning. They report
facilitating mutual assistance and complementarity among children. In North Macedonia, an educator described “a
more positive atmosphere for the entire group”.

ToC workshop
The Project document offers a strategic overview of the intervention: it presents the ToC with corresponding impact,
outcomes, and outputs specified. Instead of dwelling on the details of individual activities, it gives an indicative
outline of typical activities, which provides sufficient flexibility while offering a solid guide for monitoring.
The document ensures close correlation between the ToC, the targets, and the baseline data. The monitoring plan
of the Project is built around its logframe, particularly on the selected high-level quantitative indicators at outcome
level (based on MICS and national statistics), and quantitative targets at output level (based on activity tracking and
reports from CSOs and local duty bearers).35 Thanks to the availability of data generated by MICS, the Project
proposal provides a complete set of baseline data for outcome-level indicators. It also provides additional research
for each country, both qualitative and quantitative, using national statistics, UNICEF research, CSO reporting, and
national policies’ monitoring reports. It is unusual in an evaluation to find such comprehensive baseline data,
especially for a multi-country project.
The monitoring during Project implementation was also strong. The quarterly reports prepared by the contracted
CSOs present data in a standardised and comparable manner, thanks to a common template and comparably high
levels of reporting quality among the countries. UNICEF has done the quarterly, country-level reporting, which was
based on the contribution of the implementing partners and complemented by UNICEF monitoring. This reporting
procedure provides sound qualitative analysis which is constant over time and across the countries.
However, there are some inherent weaknesses to a quantitative approach to monitoring in the thematic area of
ECD. The first challenge is the quality and availability of quantitative data. At the start of the Project, beside MICS
data, the country quantitative data available to the Project was insufficient to fully document the baseline and the
expected changes in quantitative terms: national statistics were not comparable across countries, and sometimes
across time in the same country, it was not (and still is not) disaggregated for the target groups, and it is not
sufficiently detailed when it comes to ECD issues. The availability of such data is an assumption of the reconstructed
ToC, which was not fully met.
The Project has, to some extent, contributed to mitigating this shortcoming. Some activities helped improve the
national data collection – for instance, by supporting the establishment of a national registry of children with
disabilities in Serbia. It has elaborated good data collection tools in all countries, such as the home visiting
questionnaires for ECD workers and parents/caregivers.
35 Targets according to the project documents:
31,500 mothers and 12,700 fathers (or other caregivers) of young children with knowledge and skills to provide nurturing care12 to their
children and enable them to access quality services
7,550 children (3,830 girls and 3,720 boys) and 5,450 families with early identification and early intervention for developmental delays and
disabilities.
4,000 children (2,010 girls and 1,990 boys) from ethnic minority groups to gain access to culturally sensitive and quality health and social
services.
1,150 children (575 girls and 575 boys) with developmental difficulties and from ethnic minority groups with integrated community services
which support early child development.
1,530 children (768 girls and 762 boys) with developmental difficulties and from ethnic minority groups with access to quality and inclusive pre-
primary education
47
But the data produced by the countries remains limited, and still is not comparable between countries. Some tools
(including the home visiting questionnaires) could not be used under COVID-19 constraints, while others (for
instance a post-programme survey on parents’/caregivers’ behaviours in Montenegro), while highly valuable, are
resource-intensive compared to the Project budget, and the limited financial resources at the disposal of the CSOs
and national duty bearers in the respective countries.
Several interviewees in both “deep dive” countries expressed their inability to produce sufficient data, in particular
data on the most at-risk or vulnerable children, with a view to inclusion: although the Project has not enabled them
to address this need within its time and resources, it has contributed to make them aware of this need. By facilitating
networking in each country among State and non-State actors producing data, UNICEF also fostered relationships
and helped parterns accept each other’s data and knowledge as legitimate.
Quote (a duty bearer in North Macedonia)
“When we presented the national report [on the rights of the child] in Geneva, we were confronted with shadow
reporting by CSOs, and we got a more realistic picture. We are now trying to fulfil the Committee’s
recommendations.”
Another shortcoming is the lack of conducive means to report on changes from a process perspective. The
behavioural changes among duty bearers suffer from under-reporting and under-representation in the Project
reports because they are difficult to measure, and because the targets negotiated with the donor were quantitative
rather than qualitative.
Lesson learned: A ToC and its corresponding monitoring that exclusively focus on expected results
without sufficient attention to assumptions will limit the ability to analyse and report on processes and
link them to results.
The ToC in the Project document did not present detailed internal and external assumptions. It described general
external assumptions (e.g., “relative economic and social stability is ensured”), but these were very generic, and
they were not linked to the specific levels of the ToC. The Project document does not present any internal
assumptions. The Project document described mitigation strategies in relation to the various outcomes, but it did
not explain how to address assumptions.
In addition, the Project’s ToC was insufficiently developed: it did not identify the levels of changes correctly. During
the ToC reconstruction process, UNICEF staff and the evaluation team jointly acknowledged that the Project
document phrased each of the levels - “outputs”, “outcomes” and “impact” – too ambitiously, so that the “outputs”
were phrased more like the “outcome”, and outcomes were more appropriate in their wording to an “impact”, while
the “impact” level was more appropriate to multi-component programmatic intervention.
Finally, the review of the Project ToC found that the “outputs” often contained causality links, pointing at several
levels of change (e.g., in Outcome 1.1, “National and sub-national policies, and programmes improved, and
mechanisms strengthened” is an outcome, while “to contribute to realization of the human rights of boys and girls”
is already an effect of that outcome).
As a result, the staff found it difficult to report on processes and on the realisation of assumptions. The progress
reports did not analyse trends in the institutions concerned, or in the Project’s environment, to the levels of the
ToC. The confusion between the levels of the ToC, and the absence of clear assumptions, also made it difficult to
compare trends among the countries.
There is room to optimise and better present sound qualitative analysis. At the country and regional level, UNICEF
has been very proactive in analysing the implementation context, and this capacity needs to find an outlet which
would, in time, also feed into country programme reporting.

Evaluation question 3: What is the potential for the Project’s target groups to use the
new/improved offer of services?
Key Findings:
Finding 10: The Project has advanced significantly towards reaching targets in expanding coverage and access
to ECD, specifically ECI and PPE services in pilot municipalities.
Finding 11: The Project has contributed to a change in the targeted parents’/caregivers` attitudes towards their
children, towards services, and towards their own parental role as well as the communities. These changes are
not yet mainstreamed and were adversely affected by COVID-19 pandemic.

The final Project report shows that the Project exceeded all targets on the number of children and parents/caregivers
to be reached by the various supported services. In some cases, the number of final beneficiaries was up to ten
times the target. In the “deep dive” countries, targets in the area of PPE and community/family ECD services were
exceeded already by the end of the second year. The numbers and percentage of targets reached vary from country
to country, but not significantly.
By the end, the Project had supported a total of 63,171 parents/caregivers (46,135 mothers and 17,036 fathers) in
providing nurturing care to their children, including for children with developmental risks, delays and disabilities and
have enabled them to access quality services. This represents 143% of the target (which was 44,200 parents):
146.46% for mother and 134.14% for fathers.
Through the Project, 7,306 girls and 7,656 boys from ethnic minority groups and with disabilities gained access to
quality inclusive pre-primary education. This is almost ten times the target of 1530 children. A detailed breakdown
of beneficiaries reached by the Project can be found in Annex 12.
Interviewees confirm a stark increase in the number of children with disabilities, Roma children and children from
other minorities who were enrolled in PPE institutions and/or received ECD services through their families:
- The number of children with disabilities identified by ECD professionals (a precondition for their outreach by
ECD services, and in turn their inclusion) has increased in all countries. This is due to the use of more
advanced identification techniques (International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health of the
WHO), but also because of an increased feeling of responsibility and a more pro-active approach by ECD
professionals - both at home and through PPE institutions. It is also due to the implementation of systematic
mechanisms of reporting and referral introduced with the support of the Project. For instance, in some regions
in Kosovo*, maternity wards regularly send the lists of new-born children to home visiting professionals.
- The number of parents/caregivers and children benefiting from counselling, home visiting, and specialized
health services, has increased.
- The number of children from the target groups (Roma children and children with disabilities) in PPE institutions
has increased in all countries where Outcome 2 (PPE) was implemented. A good example is the number of
children with special needs included in the visited schools in North Macedonia, which is much higher than the
standard baseline.
49
- The level of information about ECD home services and PPE services has increased among the targeted
communities (in particular Roma communities). This is another factor which facilitates increased access ECD
services – and in turn, ECD services facilitate participation and inclusion in public services. CSOs and visiting
nurses are at the forefront of the outreach effort. For instance, CSOs, social welfare centres, community
centres, and PPE institutions inform potential beneficiaries of ECD and PPE services in Roma settlements.
Interviewees concur that the increase is most visible in pilot municipalities where services are modelled. Under the
leadership of both local duty bearers and CSOs supported by the Project – often in cooperation – these services
have deployed in areas which were out-of-reach until the Project. There is also increased potential to expand these
services in other municipalities, notably thanks to the roll-out of new legislation and by-laws, and because of the
support provided by the professionals involved in the Project, to their peers in other municipalities. In Kosovo for
instance, the interviewees confirm that the organisations receiving grants for ECD centres and services have
increased capacities (as a results of the Project) to further scale up and continue services; the legal infrastructure
is more supportive/encouraging to scale up the models by local govts to reach more beneficiaries; the education
and health service providers have increased capacities to provide services; the mindset is more as a result of the
project. However, there is no evidence to date that the services have effectively been scaled up throughout the
territory of any of the countries covered.
Quote (a duty bearer in North Macedonia)
“The number of children with disabilities has constantly increased over the past few years. Earlier, these children
simply weren’t sent to preschools. Now, with the inclusive policies, more and more parents send their kids to
regular preschools. Before the Project, we had perhaps one or two children with disabilities in the entire PPE
system. Now we have one or two per group.”
Quote (a CSO from Kosovo*)
“We have provided services now in some areas where children had no access to any kind of ECD services at all.
The services are closer to the children and are inclusive. The educators are qualified, the centres are well-
equipped, and the parents are very open and cooperative.”
In the municipalities covered by the Project, the PPE and at-home ECD services delivered are also more accessible
to the target groups, because they are better adapted to their needs, or to their socio-economic and cultural
specificities. For instance, PPE institutions supported in “deep dive” countries now routinely use assistive
technology which facilitates inclusion for children with disabilities or children who do not speak the language of
education).
Lesson learned: Access to necessary infrastructure is still missing for certain target groups.
Some basic accessibility infrastructures are still missing in some localities by the end of the Project. For instance,
in Montenegro, the distance between communities and pre-school institutions is around four to five kilometres in
some localities, with no transportation. UNICEF reports increased interest of parents/caregivers towards pre-
school in these municipalities, but these obstacles impede enrolment. The situation is particularly challenging
where there is no explicit targeting of hard-to-reach rights holders.
An interviewee from Montenegro explained: “Government standards define universal services which do not
prioritize Roma and Egyptians. And, since Roma and Egyptian families tend to be more remote, they tend to be
dropped off first. We need to tailor some trainings for service providers who do the visits, addressing Roma
families’ specific issues.”
In North Macedonia, the PPE institutions buildings are not always equipped with adequate access for children
with disabilities. Some CSOs also reported that the parents’/caregivers’ group meetings were not always adapted
to Roma parents/caregivers and parents/caregivers of children with special needs, because PPE institutions
lacked sufficient or dedicated space for delicate conversations, and because the educators lack the necessary
skills for this – which in turn discouraged some of the parents/caregivers. As an interviewee put it “the only place
and time we can focus on discussion with these parents, on these topics, are during the parents’ group meetings.
But not everyone wants to speak about their personal problems in front of the whole group. Educators sometimes
50
feel they don’t have the knowledge to lead such delicate conversations with parents.”
Finally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the lack of internet infrastructure (insufficient bandwidth, lack of
smartphones and computer equipment in the poorest communities, lack of IT literacy in some target groups) has
made it difficult for some families to access online ECD services and PPE activities. The Bebbo application’s
monitoring framework shows that these obstacles were anticipated. This particular obstacle was partially
addressed, at the start of the pandemic, through the distribution of equipment and provision of IT literacy courses
to service providers and rights holders. However, it could not be entirely overcome.
It is therefore important to assess the infrastructure situation locally, directly in each piloted municipality, to identify
accessibility obstacles early and help address them. Local, community-based CSOs could be included in the
Project and activity planning earlier, to anticipate remedies to these obstacles.
Finding 11: The Project has contributed to a change in the targeted parents’/caregivers` attitudes towards their
children, towards services, and towards their own parental role as well as the communities. These changes are not
yet mainstreamed and were adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Follow-up Survey on Parents’ and Caregivers’ Knowledge, Attitudes, Practices & Social Norms Associated with
Violence Against Children, 2019
Although the evaluation team was not able to conduct direct observation of service delivery or of interaction in the
families who accessed these services, or to interview a large number of parents/caregivers, the evaluation
documented some changes of attitudes among various direct or indirect target groups, as compared to what was
reported before the start of the Project. The attitudes considered relate to “mellow parenting” (one of the key aspects
of the Project’s workshops for parents/caregivers), and to the attitude towards services.36
As regards parenting programmes, the case of Montenegro was well-documented with a survey to
parents/caregivers who used ECD services, which corroborated the findings of interviews with rights holders, CSOs
and duty bearers in North Macedonia and Kosovo*. The survey deployed in Montenegro involved baseline and
post-programme questionnaire administered to parents/caregivers about Demographics, Parenting behaviour,
Child behaviour, Harsh Discipline, Parenting stress, Acceptability of corporal punishment, and Parental depression.
The report showed:
- Improved child discipline (significant reduction of harsh discipline)
- Increase in positive parent/child relationships (positive parenting)
- Decrease in child behaviour problems
- Increased perception of the negative impact of corporal punishment
- Slight decrease in parental stress
- High satisfaction with the programme.
Likewise, the Third Analytical Brief prepared for the Project in Moldova in 2021 identifies the same trends. It also
explains: “The most frequently mentioned benefits were the caregivers’ improved awareness and acceptance of
their child’s special needs.”37

develop better relationships between parent and child. https://www.mellowparenting.org/

These changes are not only presented as an example: they are logically linked to the parent/caregiver modules
organised by the Project and to the changes of attitudes described above among some duty bearers who are in
contact with the children, parents/caregivers and communities. Where they exist, the behaviours and attitudes of
service providers (duty bearers and CSOs) can create positive precedents of interaction, which in turn can plausibly
contribute to transforming the self-perception of parents/caregivers. The parents/caregivers interviewed displayed
attitudes as services users: services are no longer just received as “charity”, but demanded as rights, with a stronger
sense of mutual responsibility between care givers and service providers. It is therefore highly plausible that the
Project has contributed to a change among some of the targeted parents’/caregivers attitudes towards their children,
towards services, and towards their own parental role.
Quote (a duty bearer in Kosovo*)
“The Ministry of Education has a supervisory and consulting role towards PPE institutions. We monitored the
capacity building process and conducted visits. Visiting these children, I cannot find the words to explain, when
52
you see them, how enthusiastically they attend these activities. Because they have a qualified and motivated
educator in front of them, who understands the role of playing in a child’s development and learning.”
Quotes (interviewed parents)
“I felt heard, I felt supported.” “It seemed to me that I knew all those things, but then I realized how much I didn’t
know.” “I feel I am a better mother now.” “My daughter [who has a speech impediment] likes to go to the preschool,
she smiles there.”
The change of attitude is not widespread, and some interviewees pointed that some parents/caregivers are still very
reserved and protective, due to a history of exclusion towards both target groups (Roma communities and children
with disabilities). This challenge was compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic, which bred fear of contacts and
sometimes mistrust towards authorities in general, and which deprived the rights holders and service providers of
regular, continued face-to-face interaction – whereas the construction of trust-based relationships to service
providers largely depends on a continuum of personal interaction and positive experiences. However, the impact of
the Project on these challenges clearly seems to have been, by and large, positive.
Good practice: Modelling services while working on demand
The change of attitude and growing trust observed with some rights holders is largely connected to the Project’s
modelling approach, which focused on both supply and demand of ECD services in target areas. Modelling has
created positive experiences, and word of mouth is generating further demand locally, in the pilot municipalities.
It is also generating better social tolerance for differences. One of the values of the Project was therefore to allow
the expression of demand, or at least acceptance of ECD services among the target groups and, beyond, at
community level.
For instance, a nurse explained: “We are very well received by the parents in their homes, and they are very happy
to have us there. And then they talk to other mothers about us, and then other mothers start contacting us... We
have a lot of self-referrals, now.”
Likewise, a CSO in North Macedonia stated: “When we brought children [with disabilities] from the residential
institution to the small homes’ community service in the village. We were perceived as the enemies of the village.
No one wanted these children in their neighbourhood. Now the whole village is guarding these children because
they saw that the children are not enemies.”
Montenegro is also a good illustration of how the Project bridged a gap by working on both demand and supply of
ECD services: before the Project, UNICEF worked with the Ministry of Education on capacity building, directly with
teachers – but it had not worked with families directly. The Project was an opportunity to make this link between
demand and supply.
5.4 Sustainability
Evaluation question 4: What is the likelihood that the Project results will contribute to
systemic improvement of ECD for the target groups?
Key Findings:
Finding 12: The personal commitment of champions, changes in laws, regulations and policy, availability of the
human resources, and financial feasibility, all helped the Project countries to start expanding the coverage of the
modelled ECD services. This suggests a potential to gradually increase sustainability.
Finding 13: By cultivating deep and comprehensive partnerships with key institutions, the Project contributed
meaningfully to the duty bearers’ awareness of the ECD needs, gaps and opportunities, but duty bearers are
reaching the limits of what can be improved with available resources. The piloted services face emerging
challenges locally towards long-term stabilisation and scaling up.

Mellow parenting preschool event feedback documents (North Macedonia)
The evaluation found numerous examples where countries have replicated and expanded the coverage of the
modelled services and mechanisms, in a way that maintained the approach promoted by the Project.
The most easily reproduced and expanded models are the peer-to-peer (e.g., the network of ECI health
professionals and social workers established in Montenegro) and coordination mechanisms (e.g., the coordination
mechanism of institutional stakeholders regulating ECD service provision in Kosovo*). This is because they elicited
adhesion when tested through the Project as they provide the CSO and duty bearers’ practitioners with a supporting
structure based on peer-to-peer networks, which is lasting because it builds on mutual support among professionals
who share the same objectives. These mechanisms are typically overseen by the relevant line ministry (usually
health, social welfare, and/or education).
The other frequent type of expansion concerns the services themselves. Home visiting, assessment for identification
and ECI, and integrative PPE groups are the most commonly scaled up. Kosovo* provides a good illustration of
these two types of replicated models: peer to peer/coordination mechanisms, and services to rights holders. The
home visiting programme and the ECD centres were the flagship services of the Project in Kosovo*. They are
currently being expanded from the pilot municipalities to the whole territory. This was made possible by the
combined top-down (policy and legal framework) and bottom-up (local modelling) approach. In Kosovo*, the home
visiting has already been integrated in all policy and legislative framework and in the national budget, as it forms
part of the National Health Strategy and is in full ownership of the Ministry of Health (handed over by the CSOs).
Interviewees consider it sustainable in the majority of municipalities, and the model is progressively scaled up
throughout the territory.
For Kosovo*, the ECD centres are now part of the new draft Law on ECE, which foresees development of sublegal
framework regulating Centres’ ownership by local governments. At local level, they are well accepted, and
municipalities are sustaining their implementation. The Project also supported the establishment of the ECD
coordination mechanism and strengthened its capacity. Members of the ECD Coordination mechanism met
quarterly throughout the Project. This mechanism has taken on the early child education mandate and is chaired
by the Deputy Minister of Education, with membership from key early child education stakeholders.
Quote (a duty bearer in Kosovo*)
“The home visiting program is fully institutionalised now. It is operating in over 90% of the municipalities. It is our
most praised work.”
Similar patterns were reported in most countries. Judging by the examples of the “deep dive” countries, it is plausible
that the Project reporting on this matter is realistic. The key factors that enable such scale up include:
- In at least some countries, personal commitment of visible champions such as decision makers. This
may not be the case in all countries but was observed in both “deep dive” countries. Some symbolic gestures
and examples of personal leadership helped alleviate the resistance to change. For instance, in North
54
Macedonia, stakeholders report that “when we decided to close the residential institutional care in [a
municipality], the Minister for (Labour and) Social Welfare was sitting for two full days on the spot to deal with
the resistance and fears of the employees of institutional care.” In North Macedonia, there are multiple
testimonies of change agents being very engaged at community or municipal level (e.g., Mayor, PPE institution
directors). These persons are visible in the communities concerned.
- Commitment through the national legal and policy frameworks. In all countries, at least one service was
integrated explicitly into the relevant national action plans or strategies, with a view to expanding its coverage
to the whole territory.
- Financial feasibility of the models. In Kosovo* and Albania38, where new services were created or where the
division of responsibilities changed during the Project: this complexifies the financial feasibility of scaling up.
But in other countries, the Project did not create new services and the authorities did not restructure the broad
institutional setup in ECD. Therefore, in five out of seven countries, the division of responsibilities for service
provision was not altered. As a result, and because national budgets are allocated per institution, the structure
of budget allocation for these services remained mostly constant. In the “deep dive” countries, several
interviewees including from among local governance bodies and national decision makers in charge of
financing, found that the Project’s models (community-level, integrative and targeted ECD services and PPE
institutions) are more cost-effective than the models they came to replace (typically, residential institutions). In
at least one Country, the uptake of the modelled services triggered national authorities to earmark new funding:
the Serbian Government has integrated funding for the Community Centres for ECD and Inclusion.
- Preparedness of human resources. This includes training and capacity, negotiation and communication,
and the provision of the necessary tools and conceptual resources. In some countries, the Project succeeded
in integrating these tools, resources, and training into the professional development structures of the country:
for instance, Bosnia and Herzegovina integrated the ECD Assessment Scales promoted by the Project, into
the Programme of Additional Training Curriculum for home visiting nurses. Human resource preparedness
also includes the adjustment of the human resources framework (job descriptions, allocation of human
resources) after the modelled services, and the legal and policy framework were stabilised – thus avoiding
inadequate allocation of human resources and individual responsibilities. In some cases, these adjustments
took place even after the completion of the Project – which demonstrates continued commitment. This was
the case in Serbia, the Government amended the relevant bylaws on the healthcare system after the end of
Project, to adjust professional requirements towards scaling up of the ECI model: introduction of home-based
work and telework, type and scales of human resources. A UNICEF interviewee stated: “It is the first time we
have such aftermath of a Project, moving by itself to the system level after end of the Project.” Often, this
progress is a combined result of many initiatives by UNICEF, of which this Project was a part. A CSO in North
Macedonia illustrates this fact in the PPE sector: “the result of cooperation between the Ministry of Education
and UNICEF is that we have completely transformed education (including PPE) in the country. We have new
resources for schools, inclusion is mainstreamed, schools and the public are accepting inclusion better.”
While these factors seem to exist in all countries, they were not verifiable for all modelled services. There is also a
tendency of UNICEF COs to consider commitment mostly on the basis of adopted policy documents – without
always anticipating that generalisation of services may require a larger volume of local funding in the future, which
could dilute this commitment. The Project reporting and the logframe of the Project do not give sufficient space to
the monitoring of national and local budgets for the provision of services: only the Moldova foresaw this in its
indicators and systematically reported on this. Such practice should be more widespread in other offices.
Finding 13: By cultivating partnerships with key institutions, the Project contributed meaningfully to the duty bearers’
awareness of the ECD needs, gaps and opportunities, but duty bearers are reaching the limits of what can be
improved with available resources. The piloted services face emerging challenges locally towards long-term
stabilisation and scaling up.
38 In Kosovo, some new services were created such as home visiting, which meant the allocation of additional responsibilities. In Albania, the
project took place while the decentralisation reform was still new, and some responsibilities handed from the national to the municipal level
had to be adjusted/ negotiated accordingly.

The context of comprehensive partnerships with UNICEF, combined with the experience of modelled services, and
capacity development (trainings, workshops), has increased the duty bearers’ exposure to:
- ECD needs,
- The gaps between the existing service provision and these needs,
- The opportunities for using UNICEF-promoted standards, models and practices to address the needs.
Being exposed to these, the CSOs and duty bearers developed an aligned vision of ECD: interviews in PPE, health
and social/child protection sectors document a vision and key words that are common to CSOs, field practitioners,
experts, and policy makers. They all outline similar needs, recall similar guiding principles, and talk about how these
principles help address the needs and correct the shortcomings of the inherited ECD services and systems.
The alignment the ECD vision was made possible by partnerships established with key institutions. UNICEF
formalised these partnerships through detailed agreements, specifying concrete responsibilities: this enabled the
staff of these institutions and CSOs to be deeply engaged in the Project activities and prepare to own the future
steps. Many of these agreements started with this Project.39 There is an appetite to go further with bridging the gaps
which still exist in the outreach, quantity and quality of the services.
However, in some countries, some professionals have reached the limit of what the existing means allow them to
achieve. This is clearly the case for PPE services in North Macedonia. The trained educators have upgraded their
skills for inclusion; the number of included children from the target groups has increased; PPE institutions are better
equipped with assistive technology to include these children. Educators, PPE institutions’ directors, and
parents/caregivers now ascertain children’s needs and address them accordingly. However, PPE institutions as
they exist now face the limits of their ability to meet growing demand. Other community services are required,
supported by extra human resources. With early identification, an increase in demand necessitates extra resources
dedicated to supporting parents/caregivers to ensure attitudinal changes towards disabilities and inclusion: where
interviewed practitioners tried to expand their coverage beyond the scope of the Project, they sometimes faced
guarded attitudes, fear or denial towards the ECD potential of children with disabilities.
Quote (a duty bearer in North Macedonia)
“Trainings are good for the start. Preschool educators now know how to recognize developmental problems, they
know how to communicate that to the parents, and tell them what these issues are, what to do, and how they can
work with the child. But educators do not have the capacity to solve all developmental challenges of the children.
Now we lack more experts and professional staff in our preschool, more assistive technologies, and more
community-based social services.”
Quote (a parent in Kosovo)
“Educators in the preschool said that we need to work with a logopaedist. Unfortunately, there is only one
logopaedist for 100 children in the preschool, so we need to take a private logopaedist twice a week. My daughter

has significant improvements, but it’s a pity that the preschool cannot provide more support. They don’t have
enough experts employed, nor space to work with so many children, even though they are good at noticing
development challenges.”
Quote (UNICEF staff)
“We need to be more modest with systemic changes and change of attitudes of service providers. Modelling
evaluation made us think about fitting approach and programme to context.”
As some services are becoming integrated in the life of the pilot municipalities, and stabilised through national
policies and legal framework, new challenges are emerging locally – especially as the demand for inclusion and the
number of children with special needs in PPE institutions are likely to continue growing.
The transition to online service delivery in response to the COVID-19 pandemic made some services more widely
available, and a rich repository of training modules, practical tools and guidelines has been created. The ECD online
platform created in Kosovo* has reached 88% of the educators with both technical/methodological and content
training on ECD. Currently, the interviewees are concerned about reverting to face-to-face training and interaction,
which is more time-consuming and more resource intensive.
Another concern is that the expansion of services, especially in hard-to-reach locations and communities, will soon
reach the limits of human resource capacity, at least in the “deep dive” countries. According to trainers and
supervisors, there is a generational change and emigration phenomena among the practitioners, where the young
generation of educators, health professionals, and social workers reportedly display a lack of interest for community
services in general, and for rural areas in particular. The interviewees claim younger generations are reluctant to
apply to positions in Roma settlements and remote areas.
Quotes (duty bearers)
“We opened a gynaecological service and then we closed it because of the low interest of health workers to work
in areas with such complex problems. It is especially difficult now that there is a shortage of health workers, so
specialists cannot be found or hired in those settlements. Other rural parts of the country face the same problem.”
“Professional services in preschools are not complete because we lack psychologists, logopaedists, and other
experts, especially in small and rural areas.”
Lesson learned: Efforts to address violence against women and domestic violence are particularly
affected by shortages of qualified and willing personnel.
Shortages in qualified professionals have a long term gender dimension: several interviewees reported that they
are more pronounced in areas which are most affected by violence against women and domestic violence, and
that it was also particularly difficult to recruit professionals who are well trained on violence against women and
domestic violence. Further research would be needed to understand the root causes of this lack of interest.
Possible factors include the lack of available training, persisting taboos and social bias about violence against
women and domestic violence, which was documented by recent research in all the countries covered.40

The evaluation team compared the Project document, the description of the activities conducted in the seven
countries, and the approach described by UNICEF interviewees, with all applicable strategic documents of UNICEF
(country programmes and knowledge products). These documents were shown to be fundamentally aligned.
The Project objectives closely match at least one priority in every country programme. The Project indicators and
targets are fully compatible with the respective country programme documents, and, in some cases, they directly
feed into them: each country programme has at least one quantitative indicator which is identically reproduced in
the Project logframe, which corresponds to an effort to optimise reporting and avoid redundancies in data
monitoring. Due to the consideration of each country programme, the Project was checked against other UNICEF
initiatives during the design phase, and the COs ensured that it does not duplicate any parallel activities, on the
contrary, the Project continues or precedes other initiatives, in a coherent fashion. The baseline analysis, and
selection of outputs and priorities made jointly with the respective countries governments further assured the
absence of duplication with other donors’ initiatives.
The holistic, inclusive approach described under Finding 2 is strictly based on the concepts presented in UNICEF
guidance on ECD.41 The Project is by essence focused on the inclusion of vulnerable children and their families,
and the activities specifically adjusted to the most at-risk groups in the respective countries. In other words, ECD
as promoted by UNICEF is in nature inclusive. The leave-no-one-behind principle42 is therefore fully entrenched in
the Project outcomes, outputs and activities. The Project is also in line with international and European human
rights law applicable in the countries covered,43 in that it actively contributes to the prevention of discrimination
against Roma children and children with disabilities, who are most at-risk of being victims of systemic or individual
discrimination.44
The rationale and objectives of the Project are fully in line with UNICEF’s approach to ECD. By targeting children
in their early years, which are decisive for the development of a child’s cognitive capital, which in turn is decisive
for a child’s ability to realise his/her rights, the Project constitutes a coherent investment into UNICEF mandate of

every right for every child.45 Focus on early childhood is also coherent with the United Nations Convention on the
Rights of the Child, the foundation document for UNICEF: the Project document and second progress report make
an explicit connection with the Convention, and especially its General Comment No. 7 that early childhood is a
critical period for the realization of these rights. Likewise, at least six of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)
are linked directly to wellbeing and inclusion in the life cycle and particularly during the early years.

The evaluation team reviewed the Project’s products (training modules, knowledge documents, guidelines, job
descriptions, manuals on online applications, etc.), and checked it against the perception of the interviewees in the
“deep dive” countries.
The evaluation found that these products optimised a key comparative advantage of UNICEF: it is perceived by its
partners as “genuinely” knowledge-based, as an interviewee put it. Interviewees consider that UNICEF does not
just produce data and knowledge: it channels its research and learning into its products, supported by the expertise
of its core human resources (often funded by the core budget) and of the experts mobilised (funded by the Project).
The Project document, and the products funded by the Project reference and integrate various sources from
UNICEF research and guidance. This lends credibility to the Project’s products in the eyes of their users. The
products’ ability to capture existing knowledge on ECD generated by UNICEF was pointed out by stakeholders in
North Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia.
This, in turn, enabled UNICEF to bridge the gaps in the knowledge delivered by national training/higher education
institutions, both by providing this knowledge to professionals, and in several cases by supporting national
training/higher education institutions to incorporate emerging knowledge in their training and education offer.
Quote (a practitioner in North Macedonia)
“Unfortunately, we do not learn [the integrated and holistic ECD approach promoted by UNICEF] in our
University.”
The Project collected training exit evaluation questionnaires from participants in several instances: the
corresponding reports on questionnaire results show how important the knowledge transferred by UNICEF, in the
eyes of the participants. For instance, the training “Open the window” in North Macedonia was rated 3.75 out of 4
for quality, and 80% respondents found it of utmost importance (20% fairly important and 0% not important). This
is characteristic of an evidence-based organisation generating innovative concepts based on recent research.
Quote (a duty bearer in North Macedonia)
“A few factors are important for successful de-institutionalisation. The first is the knowledge of UNICEF and
national stakeholders which was developed throughout the years.”

Stakeholder analysis
The Project benefited from numerous, long-term partnerships established by UNICEF with CSOs and duty bearers
at all levels of governance, through its previous work on ECD in the seven countries. These partnerships are another
key comparative advantage of UNICEF, which the Project capitalized on to deliver results.
UNICEF partnerships ensured mutual commitments and understanding, which have proven crucial when
confronting adverse factors such as political turbulences, the COVID-19 pandemic, or more mundane resistance to
change among some stakeholders. The quality of these partnerships played the crucial role: interviewees typically
talk about “openness”, “consultation”, “joint planning” when asked how they would describe their relationship with
UNICEF. Partnerships with Ministries are characterised as holistic, long-term, and in-depth.
Quote (a duty bearer)
“UNICEF is a better development partner than many donors (…) The main difference is that UNICEF does not
intend to implement and finish a given project, but to work on the process and make a change. [Another multilateral
donor] is just committed to activities, not to the process. This makes a big difference. I am grateful UNICEF had
the courage for de-institutionalisation and inclusion reforms, which are unpopular with many people.”
Only an organization with long-term field presence can establish the breadth and diversity of partnerships available
to UNICEF (see Annex 3). The quality of UNICEF is drawing on:
- Variety of the types of partners (experts, academia, public authorities, CSOs)
- Variety of thematic fields (from health institutions to electrical engineering and IT faculties)
- Variety in governance level (national, local, community levels). This was particularly observed in the
sampled municipalities.
- Variety of decision-making levels: from top decision makers at political level, to mid-level managers, and
front-line practitioners.
Quote (a duty bearer in North Macedonia)
“A key factor of success in inclusion in education is the great motivation of UNICEF and a couple of experts who
worked on the topic. However, there are lots of hidden traps – the old interests of the professionals involved, old
habits and fears.”
The evaluation found that the existence of partnerships already established through previous projects funded
by other donors was not damaging to the visibility of the Project or the donor. Difficulty to separate the results of
various projects is a normal externality of strong coherence. The interviews and Project reporting show that UNICEF
staff was not always comfortable acknowledging this fact with the donor, as they were eager to prove the visibility
and value of the given Project to a donor, which was perceived as having strong synergies in its values with UNICEF
ECARO and COs. In the future, it will be useful to present this fact to the donor more openly and directly, which
could somewhat reduce the reporting burden on the Project staff.
Lesson learned: When reporting requirements are not commensurate to the scope of a project, the
resource burden on staff is high.
In addition to the reporting effort required by the large number of quantitative targets in the logframe, the COs and
ECARO had to maintain reporting on formal partnerships with CSOs and with local institutions receiving small
60
local projects under the outputs. In addition, UNICEF also had to report on the outcomes of the partnerships with
higher-level actors, chiefly the Ministries and national institutes (health institutes, training institutions, etc.).
Partnership reporting was extremely useful to monitoring because it equipped the Project with comparable reports
which fed into reporting on targets. However, it generated heavy obligations on UNICEF staff, which was mostly
funded by the core budget. It was not possible to quantify the hours of reporting work generated by the Project,
but there is a consensus to find that it was disproportionate to the amount of extra-budgetary contribution received
for a Project which was a complement, the culmination (after long investments made over the years), or the start
(as seed funding) of other, often larger projects and programmes.
This was compounded by constraints placed by the donor on the ToC of the Project, and on the reporting
framework. As demonstrated by document review, confirmed during the ToC reconstruction workshop and
interviews with the donor, UNICEF had to formulate the expected changes in a way that would align with the
donor’s strategic framework, which places changes at a very high level. As a result, the level of change placed on
the Project were placed too high, especially as compared to the budget and timeframe of the Project. Combined
with an all-quantitative set of indicators, this directed the reporting efforts to a level of change that would normally
be characteristic of their five-year country strategy reporting, but which is not adapted to a shorter, more modest
Project. Not only was this very resource-intensive, but it also constrained their ability to report at a lower level on
process-related changes.
The recent partnership with the donor could partly explain these constraints. It was also constrained by COVID-
related rules, which prevented the ADA headquarter and country representatives (where present) to engage in
face-to-face interaction with UNICEF. Nevertheless, this partnership was characterized by good faith negotiations
and an alignment of values and overall objectives. There was flexibility in the management of the Project, permitted
by this synergy, which became increasingly apparent as the Project progressed. However, at the design phase,
donor constraints placed on the Project’s expected outputs and outcomes appeared disproportional to the size
(budget, timing) of the Project, which resulted in monitoring and reporting difficulties.
Finding 17: In several countries, UNICEF acted as “convener” for other donors, especially in ECD, where matching
funds helped expand and magnify the effects of the Project.
Triangulated evidence basis

During the Project design and implementation phases, UNICEF leveraged its partnerships, as described above,
and played a “convener” role of like-minded stakeholders. The partnerships described above are at the basis of
UNICEF’s role as a convener of diverse actors: in a holistic area like ECD, these actors have broad common
objectives, and their mandates necessitate horizontal cooperation, but they sometimes experience communication
difficulties due to diverging incentive structures, or a history of compartmentalised professional qualifications. By
bringing them together around the implementation of evidence-based, reputable standards, and by investing its
social and political capital into their interaction (trust, reputation), UNICEF creates more conducive conditions for
these actors to work together and align.
Interviews with duty bearers at national level, with the donor, with other international partners, and with UNICEF
staff suggest that UNICEF is perceived as strategically positioned on ECD. These actors often consider UNICEF to
have filled critical gaps for other donors which lack specific mandate, knowledge and expertise. For instance,
UNICEF is considered to have played a decisive role in raising ECD on the policy agenda of several governments,
and in alerting donors about it. This role as a convener is then followed by coordination with other donors: UNICEF
staff also reported that they coordinated with other donors throughout to exchange updates on programming,
implementation, and situational analysis, and identification of respective supporting roles towards authorities in
ECD.
61
The documents and interviews show that the mandate of UNICEF is well understood by the interlocutors among
CSOs, country-level duty bearers and other international actors. Its country programmes are also sufficiently clear
to communicate effectively with these actors. These advantages are conducive to a convener’s role.
The Project matched, and more often was matched by funding initiatives of other donors: the EU in Montenegro,
UNFPA and WHO and the World Bank in North Macedonia, the Luxemburg Government and the World Bank in
Kosovo*. This ensured coherence and multiplied the effects of the Project in these countries. At the same time, it
also reduces the ability of UNICEF – and of this evaluation – to directly attribute changes at impact level to UNICEF
and in particular to this Project. The convener’s role of UNICEF is a comparative advantage to contribute to impact
– but it dilutes attributability.
The interviewed national stakeholders were conscious of these matching funds and the use of common tools,
knowledge and messages among United Nations agencies, perceiving them as proof of coherence, in the spirit of
the “delivering as one” approach. This was particularly the case of WHO and UNFPA. Cooperation and common
approach with UNWOMEN, on the other hand, was absent from interviews and not prominent in reporting. This is
concurrent with the limited gender analysis in the Project.

“UNICEF helped us develop the models for capacity development, and we need to continue and rollout this reform
with the support of the World Bank.”

“UNICEF, UNFPA and WHO joined forces to help the Ministry of Health on perinatal and maternal health. We
dispatched duties based on the expertise. Each of us has our own strengths and mandate.”
6. EVALUATION CONCLUSIONS
The Project design has to a large extent responded relevantly to the evolving needs and aspirations of the rights
holders and duty bearers. The Project ToC and how it resulted in concrete outputs and activities for each country
and pilot municipality were highly relevant to the needs of ECD actors and rights holders (children and their
parents/caregivers), particularly because the design was based on thorough analysis. This includes MICS data, but
also in-depth analysis of the dynamics at play with the Project stakeholders from national to municipal players, and
a strong understanding of national policy priorities. By ensuring the Project design and implementation was informed
by current evidence, UNICEF optimised its comparative advantage as an evidence-based organisation.
Consequently, the high quality and relevance of the Project’s products (trainings, publications, reports, research, IT
equipment and applications, etc.) elicited strong satisfaction among the users.
While relevant to the situation, the ToC was formulated and organised so as to both capture the Project’s objectives
and fulfil donor requirements (to align with the donor’s strategy and reporting framework), which was not always
compatible. As a result, the ToC was not conducive to monitoring and reporting on changes. It placed expectations
of results at too high a level, and lacked specific assumptions, both internal and external, for each level of change.
Agreement with ADA regarding the target groups was fully aligned with national priorities and the needs in ECD,
however it did not take full account of the needs of other vulnerable and underserved groups. This shortfall was
compensated by the flexibility of UNICEF, ADA, and the Project partners, who managed to include other target
groups locally in some instances. The evaluation did not find clear differences between both target groups (children
with disabilities and their families; Roma children and their families) in terms of access to the Project’s outputs.
The Project ToC as a whole, its outputs and activities, were relevant to the national priorities. Moreover, they were
intrinsically aligned with national ECD policies, because of the two-way mutually reinforcing nature of the partnership
between policymakers and UNICEF: both sides contributed to the design of, respectively, the Project and national
62
policies. This, in turn, ensured the feasibility of the Project because the choice of outputs mirrored national priorities.
It also ensured that national policies and priorities reflected and channelled UNICEF knowledge and vision of ECD.
Through this collaborative policy and Project design, a common vision of ECD emerged, which is traceable in the
ECD policy and legal documents adopted during the Project timeframe in the seven countries. This collaborative
partnership most likely existed prior to the Project; however, the Project has clearly accelerated cooperation, and
contributed to delivery of the concrete policy and legislative outputs.
The above strengths partly compensated for the shortcomings in the availability, quality and comparability of
country-generated quantitative and qualitative data. The availability of such data was an assumption of the Project
which was not fully realised.
The Project was fundamentally coherent with UNICEF strategic documents and drew on its expertise as a
comparative advantage. It also benefited substantially from existing partnerships of UNICEF with state agencies
and non-state actors, which were leveraged to expand on generation and application of knowledge. In several
cases, there is evidence of UNICEF acting as “convener” for other donors, especially in ECD. The Project had to
contend with the resource distribution dilemma: under existing time and resource constraints, it often had to either
prioritize implementing activities to increase the quality and outreach of the services or to work on producing quality
primary data. Quality data would require sustained support to the duty bearers but cannot be done until duty bearers
systematize early identification and early childhood intervention, generalising the approach and services modelled
by the Project. In the short to medium term, it is unrealistic that the stakeholders’ human resources and capacity –
already thinly stretched – could be used to qualitatively improve the data breadth and depth. Fresh staff would need
to be hired and trained.
Another shortcoming was that Project documents and reports failed to document (until final reporting) a clear gender
analysis to back up the activities which, nevertheless, had a significant gender focus. Future efforts would need to
build stronger links between projects and existing research, and they may consider exploring more extensive
partnerships with dedicated partners, such as UN Women, or specialized CSOs.
The Project contributed effectively to the realization of the expected changes by creating and expanding on
partners’ network, and building skills of its counterparts. ECI, ECD and PPE services became considerably more
available and accessible for the target groups. The Project has embraced the change management approach, which
was backed by a comprehensive monitoring framework. Yet, the quality of data – beyond the scope of the Project’s
impact – has hampered the efficiency of the monitoring framework. The Project strengthened, and sometimes
created alliances among ECD duty bearers, and between ECD duty bearers, other sectors and CSOs in the
countries covered. In doing so, even though this was not explicitly articulated in the ToC, the Project effectively
applied a change management strategy, building the readiness (knowledge and skills), willingness (values and
attitudes) and ability (enabling environment) of the CSOs, health institutions, PPE institutions, social services and
other child protection institutions to transform the way they approach and implement the ECD.46 The Project
contributed to all three aspects:
• Trainings and mentoring considerably increased the readiness of the practitioners, by equipping them with
the knowledge, understanding and skills necessary to provide holistic, child-centred, inclusive and quality
services to children and their families;
• The policy component, the networking, and the work done on the workflows, institutional arrangements,
networking and job descriptions, contributed to ECD professionals’ abilities;
• The modelling and trainings affected the values and attitudes displayed by professionals, which increased
their willingness to promote the vision of ECD.
The Project therefore built on the comparative advantage of UNICEF as a long-term partner for ECD actors which
is capable of understanding the situation of the various stakeholders and of convening them around a common
vision. This factor was instrumental to achieve the modelling of improved ECD services. This was particularly

63
successful for home visiting, inclusive PPE institutions, and more generally early identification and early
intervention. The modelling of these services mostly overcame the heavy constraints imposed by the COVID-19
pandemic and the limited means and infrastructure available: at the time of the evaluation, all envisaged activities
were implemented with a few exceptions, although many encountered delays due to the COVID-19 measures and
the overwhelming task facing health and education institutions in countering the pandemic.
Most importantly, the modelling of improved services and the preparation of policy and legal documents provided
platforms to concretely test the common vision of UNICEF and ECD stakeholders. The interviewed rights holders
were satisfied with the services they accessed, while the practitioners were increasingly ready, willing and able to
provide the modelled services.
The Project made a considerable impact on the expansion of coverage and access to ECD, specifically ECI and
PPE services in pilot municipalities. The attitudes of the beneficiary parents and caregivers towards their children,
services and their roles have changed tangibly in the intended sense. Yet, COVID-19 pandemic impacted these
changes and made them less mainstreamed and sustainable than intended. The conjunction of top-down
(supporting policy and legal documents) and a bottom-up (modelling) approaches have laid the basis for more
comprehensive ECD systems to be progressively established in the future. It is unclear whether the Project elicited
demand beyond the pilot municipalities, but the growing numbers of users reported in sampled municipalities in the
“deep dive” countries, and the reported gradual evolution of the targeted parents’/caregivers’ attitudes towards their
children and ECD services suggests that an emerging demand should be anticipated.
The Project’s approach to strengthen existing priorities and services without fundamentally transforming the
structure of ECD services creates favourable conditions for these strengthened services to be budgeted in the future
since no separate or new budget lines need to be created at national or local level. However, as the services develop
and cover a larger number of beneficiaries, the magnitude of these budgets would need to grow accordingly.
In terms of sustainability, there is a high likelihood that the Project results will continue in the long run to contribute
to systemic improvement of ECD for the target groups. The personal commitment of the champions of change, as
well as the changes in policy and regulatory frameworks have potential for increased sustainability, especially since
these changes are embedded through comprehensive partnerships that UNICEF has built with key institutions. Yet,
financial and human resources constraints are considerable, and more investment is needed to first stabilize and
then scale up achieved changes. Similarly, as priorities are defined and services expand, the limits of the national
systems, in terms of human resources and infrastructure, become apparent. This was particularly visible for PPE
institutions. If the objective is to scale up the modelled services, the national institutional capacities must be
upgraded too.
The ECD systems, if they continue to be supported by decision makers and practitioners, if they receive
commensurate funding from national and local authorities, and if the emerging demand from rights holders is
confirmed, are likely to progressively embody and practice the holistic, child-centred, and inclusive approach – but
these necessary conditions will require the continued support of UNICEF or other donors.
In several countries, other donors and organisations have started to provide matching support to UNICEF and ADA
with broader successor programmes, which should be able to build on the positive precedents of this Project and
on the normative foundations and commitments established with the contribution of the Project. In other country
contexts, the Project has benefitted from the positioning of UNICEF, and has given momentum to the “convener”
role of UNICEF, although this has not yet materialized into funding.
7. RECOMMENDATIONS
The recommendations laid out below were discussed and validated in two steps: (1) the evaluation team consulted
UNICEF ECARO on draft preliminary recommendations in a meeting that openly reviewed the appropriateness and
feasibility of the each recommendation, (2) upon completion of the draft final report, UNICEF ECARO and COs
64
commented on the recommendations, both in terms of content and structure.
The recommendations are presented in order of priority.
1. ADA would better optimise future investments into UNICEF projects by allowing UNICEF ECARO
programmes (such as the ECD) to develop full-fledged theories of change at a realistic level for complex
projects, as this would increase the feasibility and tailoring of future projects.
Rationale of the recommendation:
Findings: 1, 3, 5, 9, 16
The evaluation showed that donor requirements regarding quantitative targets, target groups, and the level of
outputs and outcomes had constrained the production of a ToC which would be achievable within the timeframe
and budget of the Project, and that the Project ToC lacked some key elements. These aspects were particularly
constraining in view of the relatively modest budget once the budget is broken down per country and per year. This
later unnecessarily complicated the monitoring of the Project. A full-fledged ToC would enable future project teams
to better identify the changes they aim to achieve, and the factors at play for these changes. They would create a
strong basis and an easy-to-use framework for more analytical project monitoring. This is particularly useful for
regional projects to harmonise and channel the analysis which the country offices perform as part of country
programme implementation reporting.
Operational suggestions:
• The theories of change should unpack the input, output, outcome and impact level, and identify internal and
external assumptions necessary for change to take place from one level to the next.
• The targets proposed to the implementing partner should focus on the existence of changes at output and
outcome levels, and on the realisation of assumptions associated to these two levels.
2. UNICEF ECARO should continue to advocate to donors and, when successful, support countries to
systematize services for early detection, early intervention and standard-based functional
assessments.
UNICEF ECARO, supported by the country offices, should make and present a research- and knowledge-backed
investment case to potential donors (and Governments in the countries of the region) to invest more in ECD as a
high-potential investment for social inclusion and poverty reduction and eradication of violence against children.
When successful, UNICEF should continue to design specific projects to support countries to strengthen,
harmonise, systematise and connect comprehensive and standard-based ECD services.
Rationale of the recommendation:
Findings: 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 14
The evaluation has shown the potential of the modelled services, and the ownership of both policy makers and
practitioners when these services are implemented. Support to such reforms will inform policy making, organisation
and financing of ECD services, and cross-fertilisation at policy and practice levels.
Operational suggestions:
• UNICEF ECARO should develop an investment case, complemented by advocacy products based on data,
research and knowledge, to be used at regional and country levels for resource mobilisation for ECD.
• These projects should invest not only in services themselves, but also in the links between these services.
• The ToC of the complex projects stemming from this advocacy effort will require, even more than others,
up-to-date and explicit gender analysis building on the existing evidence (e.g., from the preparation of
Country Programme Documents, other projects, and external sources). Such projects should include
gender transformative results explicitly supported by the set of activities. This is in line with guidance on the
UN System-wide Action Plan on gender equality and the empowerment of women.
• The corresponding indicators and targets should be both quantitative and qualitative, result- and process-
oriented.
• Priority should be given to:
o Institutionalised early detection, early intervention (in particular home visiting) services and
65
standard-based functional assessments
o Universal community-based ECD services beyond the locations where they were modelled
o Inclusive PPE services, beyond the locations where they were modelled
o Gender transformative results through inclusive ECD, backed up by up-to-date gender analysis.
3. UNICEF ECARO should strengthen, expand and sustain multidisciplinary networks of ECD
professionals at national and regional levels.
Rationale of the recommendation:
Findings: 6, 7, 8, 13, 17
The evaluation found multiple examples of emerging networks of dedicated, like-minded professionals who start to
embody and champion ECD concepts and services promoted by UNICEF. It is essential that these networks are
maintained that they act as platforms for practitioners to learn from and support one another, and that they attract
more professionals. The evaluation has also shown the delays experienced in creating regional peer-to-peer
exchanges (due to the length of the project and the conditions created by the pandemic), whereas these exchanges
are deemed very important by the stakeholders.
Operational suggestions:
• UNICEF should invest in should have strong, sizeable national and regional peer-to-peer component(s) –
or, ideally, create a regional multidisciplinary platform for ECD professionals
• Beyond investment in ECD services themselves, future projects should strengthen the links between these
services, by capitalizing on the networks of committed professionals already built through this and previous
projects
• UNICEF should build on the work done on national registries to prepare the ground for future data-informed
national policies
• Ideally, if and once governments generalize early detection, early intervention and standard-based
functional assessments, such projects would also work as a platform for regional exchanges among peers
on basic data collection methods and informed policy making. This would ensure cross-fertilisation of
informed policy and decision making in the future. Specific project sub-components could address this
cross-fertilisation.
4. UNICEF ECARO should build tools to monitor attitude, behavioural and practice changes among trained
practitioners.
Rationale of the recommendation:
Findings: 1, 9, 12, 16
The Project supported an impressive array of trainings and sensitization activities to a large number of PPE, health
and social professionals; however, UNICEF did not collect a lot of data on how these interventions changed the
skills, approach, attitudes, behaviours, perception and practical application of the knowledge acquired – which are
particularly important for ECD services. Such data would inform child rights monitoring, country-level reporting, and
programming.
Operational suggestions:
• UNICEF ECARO should ensure that sizeable training/capacity building components integrate some initial
data generation, and a monitoring mechanism regarding the approach, attitudes, behaviours, perception
and practical application of the knowledge acquired by the professionals trained by UNICEF. This could be
done through an annual or biennial (online) survey of these professionals tailored to the training portfolio.
• Thorough gender analysis should always underpin the definition of the desired behavioural and attitude
changes. Among the expected results which aim at capacity building and behavioural/attitudinal change,
some should clearly be identified as gender transformative results.
5. UNICEF ECARO should continue providing policy guidance to country offices on systematically
promoting job descriptions and internal regulations of ECD duty bearers based on the products already
elaborated.

Rationale of the recommendation:
Findings: 7, 12, 15
This recommendation will strengthen the sustainability of changes in practices and behaviours beyond training
because it will entrench horizontal interactions, techniques, and the use of UNICEF-supported tools into the
individual performance framework of practitioners, and into the incentive structure. It will also prepare the
organisational functioning of ECD-relevant institutions to future expansion of modelled services, including in terms
of human resources.
Operational suggestions:
• UNICEF ECARO should generalise the practice, tested in Moldova, of jointly re-drafting the job descriptions
of key ECD personnel in ECD-relevant institutions. UNICEF should also work systematically, to the extent
that partners are amenable to it, on the internal regulations of these institutions (e.g., internal rulebooks) as
was done in Serbia, Kosovo* and North Macedonia, for instance.
6. For future, complex ECD projects, UNICEF ECARO should develop basic information products/
documents about the respective projects.
Rationale of the recommendation:
Finding: 2
The evaluation has shown that some partners did not have all the information about the full scope and objectives
of the Project. This challenge was related to the complexity of the Project, the broad range of Project partners, and
the turnover experienced in many institutions. The proposed information products will enhance the partners’
understanding of complex projects - the goals, target groups and geographic coverage, implementation modalities,
and timespan. Partners will be in a better position to optimize their take from the future projects.
Operational suggestions:
• UNICEF ECARO, supported by country offices, should, as a standard practice for large and/or complex
projects, elaborate concise information documents/products (such as presentations and/or one-page briefs)
for all project partners.
• These products should be developed in priority for the most complex projects which involve many partners.
