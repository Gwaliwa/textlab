Executive summary
Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in Africa, with 75 per cent of the Malagasy people
living below the international poverty line of $1.90 in 2019 (World Bank, n.d.). Furthermore,
67.6 per cent of Malagasy children are reportedly multidimensionally poor, meaning that they
suffer material deprivation in at least two different dimensions of well-being (Silva-Leander,
2020). Overall, the country is ranked 164 out of 189 countries and territories on the Human
Development index, with a value of 0.528 (UNDP, 2020). The extreme poverty is further
aggravated by natural and environmental disasters, such as cyclones and drought. For
example, Southern Madagascar is facing its fourth consecutive year of droughts, the effects
of which are expected to quadruple child malnutrition in the region (UNICEF & WFP, 2021).
In 2020, the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic affected Madagascar’s upward economic
growth experienced over the previous three years,
potentially reversing recent declines in poverty rates

suggests that large, structural problems limit the
effectiveness of schooling. Education costs are the
primary driver of school dropout in countries like Madagascar (Huisman & Smits 2015;
Glick & Sahn 2006). Poor households in particular are more likely to withdraw their children
from school as it becomes costlier. Further, households in Madagascar appear to have a poor
understanding of the returns on education. Nguyen (2008) found that people in Madagascar
do not know how much children benefit from education. However, when presented with this
information, individuals begin to enrol their children in school. Evidence also indicates that
school management suppresses school enrolment in Madagascar (Lassibille, Tan, Jesse, &
Van Nguyen, 2010). When individual schools reformed their management structure to
improve pedagogical practices, student enrolment, attendance, and grade repetition all
improved.
1 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection
Component in Madagascar
Overview of intervention being evaluated
In recent years, the government of Madagascar has been gradually developing a social
protection system to better respond to the needs of its population. In 2014, the Malagasy
government ranked last in the UNDP Social Protection Index for Africa, spending only 0.7
percent of its GDP on social protection (UNICEF, 2021). In order to encourage increased
investment in social protection, the government elaborated a National Social Protection
Policy in 2015 that focused on four axes, the first of which is “Increasing the incomes of the
poorest.” Under Axis 1, the national social safety net programme is composed of two main
components: “(i) a conditional cash transfer programme known as TMDH/LUL (Monetary
Transfer for Human Development / Let Us Learn) conditional cash transfer related to primary
and secondary school attendance, and (ii) a cash transfer programme on productive safety net
(PSN)” (Celada, 2017). It is important to note, though, that only 5% of the poorest
households and 3% of the poorest children are benefitting from these programmes, a far cry
from the goals of 15% by 2023 and 50% by 2030 (UNICEF, 2021). Operating with an
estimated budget of 4.4 million USD, the TMDH and LUL conditional cash transfer
programmes provides social assistance in the form of monetary cash transfers to the poorest
households in order to reduce the financial barriers limiting access to school.1 The
programmes were launched by the Ministry for Population, Social Protection, and Women’s
Empowerment (MPPSPF), in collaboration with the Development Intervention Fund (FID) as
implementing partner, World Bank as a funder for TMDH, and the support of the United
Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Madagascar as a technical assistance partner and funder
for the LUL conditional cash transfer programme. The LUL cash transfer supplement
provides a second cash transfer to TMDH beneficiary households (also known as rights
holders) with older children in order to promote transition to and continued enrolment in
secondary school. The transition from primary school (7ème) to lower secondary school
(6ème) at roughly 10 years of age is a point at which many students in Madagascar
leave school. UNICEF identified three goals for LUL: 1) a substantial number of girls and
boys registered in school and the dropout rate is reduced; 2) a large proportion of children
have access to basic education, especially the most excluded children; 3) social protection
dialogues are in place as well as measures to incorporate social protection into relevant
programme areas.
The LUL supplement transfer is part of a greater LUL programme that also distributes
learning materials and is supporting a remedial education program entitled Cours de Remise à
Niveau (CRAN). This evaluation, however, only focuses on the supplemental cash transfer
component of the program. The TMDH and LUL transfers began in October 2016 and
continued throughout the 2016–2017, 2017–2018, 2018–2019, 2019–2020, and 2020–2021
school years. The LUL cash transfer supplement ended in August 2021. The programme’s
exit strategy includes the distribution of self-sufficiency agricultural kits to beneficiaries, as
well as training sessions on improved agricultural techniques for youth. This evaluation of the
LUL cash transfer supplement has been commissioned by UNCIEF. A separate evaluation of
TMDH will be commissioned by the World Bank.
Evaluation purpose and intended users
This summative evaluation serves two primary purposes. First, the primary users of this
evaluation include UNICEF Madagascar, FID, and the MPPSPF, who can use the report to
improve the LUL cash transfer programme and inform the development of other cash transfer
1 In 2016, the expected budget for the LUL programme was 1,591,590 USD (UNICEF, 2016).

Component in Madagascar
programmes in Madagascar. The secondary users of this evaluation include partners,
policymakers, donors, UNICEF ESARO and Headquarters. It is expected that the evaluation
can inform these users about the impact the national programme has had on reducing the
vulnerability of poor people in Madagascar. It is our hope that the results and lessons learned
from the evaluation will be used to inform the development of the national social protection
system in Madagascar. From this perspective, the intended users of this evaluation include
MPPSPF, the Ministry of National Education, FID, the UNICEF Madagascar Country Office,
and the World Bank, also known as the duty bearers for the evaluation.
Evaluation objectives
As stated in the TOR, the general objective of the consultancy is to conduct impact and
process evaluations of the LUL component of the TMDH programme. The primary objective
of the evaluation is to assess the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impacts, coherence, and
sustainability of the LUL programme.
Evaluation methodology
This LUL evaluation draws on a mixed-methods design, combining a longitudinal
quantitative randomised controlled trial (RCT) with a qualitative process evaluation using
interviews and a desk review. As much as possible, we use the quantitative and qualitative
methods to complement each other so that we can triangulate all findings.
Impact evaluation
The impact evaluation of UNICEF’s LUL supplement to the TMDH transfer is a 4.5-year,
multi-armed RCT design. The AIR team estimated the effect of the LUL supplement on key
outcomes, including school enrolment, child labour, and household support for education. We
compared households randomly assigned to receive no transfer (control), receive the TMDH
transfer but not the LUL supplement (TMDH only), or receive the TMDH and LUL
supplemental transfers (LUL). We provide rigorous impact estimates by exploiting an RCT
design in which the treatment arm was randomly assigned at the commune level using a two-
step process. During the first step, 38 of the 52 communes were randomly assigned to receive
the TMDH transfer, while the remaining 14 communes would receive no transfer. During the
second step, 26 of the 38 communes were randomly assigned to receive the LUL supplement
in addition to the TMDH transfer.
The study included three rounds of data collection: the baseline round was conducted in
August and September 2016, a one-year follow-up was conducted in mid-2018, and the
endline took place in early 2021. At baseline, 4,484 households participated in the survey. At
midline, the sample increased to a total of 6,006 households. Between the baseline and
midline rounds, 3,650 household joined the study to increase its statistical power, while 2,356
households were holdovers from baseline. The additional midline households were randomly
selected from a roster of eligible households. At endline, we surveyed 2,588 total households
(1,455 from midline plus 1,133 new randomly selected households). Of these households,
1,602 were LUL recipients (a 66.85 per cent increase from midline); 462 were LUL-eligible,
TMDH-only households; and 524 were LUL-eligible households from control communes
(not receiving either LUL or TMDH).
Process evaluation
The process evaluation design included one round of primary qualitative data collection at the
central, district, and commune/village levels and a brief document review. To investigate
3 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection
Component in Madagascar
research questions related to programme relevance, efficiency, coherence, and sustainability,
AIR conducted 22 KIIs with selected UNICEF, FID, World Bank and MPPSPF staff
overseeing the LUL component, as well as other collaborators/implementers. AIR also
conducted at total of 24 FGDs with beneficiary children and parents as well as non-
beneficiary children and parents to address research questions related to programme
relevance, efficiency, and impact. Through the document review, AIR examined relevant
LUL programme design documents and reports, UNICEF programmatic and strategic
documents, and national social protection strategy and policy documents. We triangulated
findings from the process evaluation and impact evaluation to deepen the research team’s
understanding of programme impacts and identify implementation issues that could
potentially affect impacts.
Limitations
We identified six primary limitations to the study. Firstly, the LUL transfer targets, among
others, children who have already dropped out of school and we are less likely to detect
impacts for that group. It is possible that households may have reacted to their treatment
status before the baseline survey. We could not secure the transfer of a full history of
administrative transfer records, so it was not possible for us to characterize the typical
payment delay. Our research design included only one round of qualitative data collection,
which gives us a snapshot of implementation at a given time but does not allow us to fully
understand how implementation has changed or evolved over time. Qualitatively, it was
challenging to disentangle the perceived impacts of LUL from TMDH. Finally, due to travel
restrictions during the COVID pandemic, the AIR team was not able to travel to Madagascar
to train the ATW team and conduct high-level key stakeholder interviews in person.
Key findings
Our findings suggest that the LUL cash transfer was relevant to the needs of the target group
and aligned with government priorities, though beneficiaries reported that they still had
outstanding education costs associated with children’s schooling. Self-reported programme
take-up increased among eligible households from 62.5 per cent at midline to 71.9 per cent at
endline. The LUL programme faced challenges in disbursing payments in a timely manner,
though it was effective in delivering the correct sum of money to beneficiary households.
Overall, we find that the LUL cash transfer led to improvements in school enrolment amongst
recipients. However, many children in the upper end of LUL’s 11–18-year-old eligibility
range are still not enrolled in school, and grade progression rates appear to slow for children
in higher grades. These findings suggest that grade progression and dropout are still concerns
for the programme. In addition, while we find that the LUL transfer had limited impacts on
selected outcomes that improved children’s education, it does not appear to have affected
other outcomes, such as consumption or food security. These limited impacts are
unsurprising, given that the LUL programme was designed as a top-off for the existing
TMDH transfer that supports households with children. Focus group participants generally
agreed that the LUL cash transfer made a difference in their ability to send their children to
school, though they noted that they still had additional costs they would incur for their
children to attend school.
Qualitative data suggest that LUL was consistent with other national and international
programmes, and harmonized programming with other projects such as TMDH, resulting in
time and resources savings. However, several stakeholders called for stronger collaboration
related to monitoring student attendance. The LUL cash transfer top-up will not continue in
4 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection
Component in Madagascar
its current form after the last payment in August 2021. UNICEF plans to move towards an
unconditional cash transfer scheme with a lower administrative burden. Some informants
expressed concern about the heavy reliance on UNICEF as the external funder of the LUL
cash transfer, while others noted that the government of Madagascar had started contributing
to the TMDH cash transfer and were more optimistic about government ownership of cash
transfers as part of the national social protection plan moving forward.
Key conclusions
In this section, we present a table with key conclusions based on the research findings
described above, organized by different evaluation criteria. We also present our evaluative
rating of each criteria. A green rating indicates that, as per our evaluation, the program was
generally successful in meeting the criterion, a yellow rating indicates that the program was
partially successful in meeting the criterion, and a red rating indicates that the program was
generally unsuccessful in meeting the criterion.
Evaluation Key Conclusions Evaluative
Criteria Rating
Relevance • Transfers were quite relevant for the setting of secondary school in Green
Madagascar.
• The amount of the transfer was not relevant in that it was not large
enough to cover the entire opportunity cost of children aged 11–18.
Efficiency • Further advertisement of the LUL programme could have increased Yellow
programme take-up.
• Payment process was largely effective in ultimately delivering the correct
sum of money to beneficiaries.
Effectiveness • LUL reduced cost-related barriers to school access. Yellow
• LUL should be paired with interventions that directly target education
quality in order to achieve impacts on dropout rates, grade progression
and learning outcomes.
Impact • The transfer served as an incentive for households to enrol children in Yellow
school and offset lost wages from child labour.
• The size of the transfer was likely too small for households to cover other
education expenditures or to change aspects of their consumption
behaviour.
Coherence • The LUL cash transfer benefitted from synergies with TMDH. Yellow
• There may be additional opportunities for partnerships with other national
and international programmes.
Sustainability • The LUL transfer will not continue in its current form after the final Red
payments are made to beneficiaries in August.
Lessons learned
Several lessons learned emerged from the evaluation findings that can inform future cash
transfer programming—especially cash transfers focusing on education. In particular, the
results of this programme evaluation highlight the following lessons:
1. Programme goals should be carefully identified, and the transfer structured to attain
those goals.
2. Conditionality reporting for cash transfer programmes should be simplified as much
as possible to minimize the administrative work required of school staff and to ensure
that attendance data are reported accurately and with the required frequency.
5 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection
Component in Madagascar
3. Implementing agencies of cash transfer programmes should ensure that beneficiary
lists are frequently updated and there is adequate coordination between the
beneficiary lists when carrying out more than one interrelated programme (such as
TMDH-LUL).
4. It is important for studies of supplemental cash transfer programmes to continue to
include a mixed-methods design that allows for rigorous examination of the
supplemental cash transfer while still capturing more holistic perceptions about the
entire joint programme.
Key recommendations
The evaluation team developed recommendations for the LUL programme based on the
research findings and conclusions of this study. Based on a workshop conducted with duty
bearers, the team validated and prioritized recommendations. We have organized the
recommendations below starting with those that are of the highest priority and most feasible.
1. In future cash transfer schemes, UNICEF, FID, and MPPSF should ensure there is a
clearly defined and well-functioning complaints mechanism that all beneficiaries are
aware of. The key personnel who are tasked with transmitting beneficiary complaints to FID
and relaying follow-up information to beneficiaries must be clearly identified. Further, FID
should consider developing a mechanism for tracking complaints and communicating
complaint status to beneficiaries.
2. When payments are delayed, FID should ensure beneficiaries are promptly informed
of when they will receive the next payment. LUL payments were regularly delayed due to
COVID-19 and insecurity issues. It is essential to promptly and clearly communicate
payment delays to retain beneficiary trust and facilitate their planning.
3. UNICEF should work to ensure greater synergies between cash transfers and ongoing
interventions targeting education quality. LUL overlapped with initiatives aiming to
improve access to education but lacked a focus on education quality. Ensuring linkages
between cash transfers and programmes to improve education quality, could provide a more
comprehensive approach to overcoming the existing barriers to education that students face.
4. UNICEF, FID, and MPPSPF should consider a universal cash transfer scheme with a
smaller administrative burden to ensure payments are delivered on time consistently.
The administrative burden of reporting conditionality has already been identified by UNICEF
as a challenge to sustainability, and the organization’s plan to move towards an
unconditional, universal child benefit would avoid this issue. However, while the LUL
programme continues, FID should consider simplifying the process of reporting
conditionality as much as possible, and clearly communicate the process to stakeholders.
5. UNICEF should consider a larger transfer amount, combined with “soft conditioning
mechanisms,” to maximize impact and ensure the enrolment and attendance gains
continue as the programme transitions towards a universal cash transfer. . A larger
transfer per child could lead to bigger impacts and would address the concern about 10,000
AR being too small to induce change. Incorporating “soft conditioning” mechanisms, such as
messaging about the importance of attendance, could help sustain enrolment and attendance
gains observed through the LUL cash transfer supplement. This messaging could be targeted
at children in key transition grades who are particularly vulnerable to drop out.
6 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection
Component in Madagascar
6. UNICEF should continue to advocate for government support of cash transfers and
consider developing a contribution schedule with increasing annual targets for
government contributions to the universal cash transfer. As UNICEF moves towards a
universal cash transfer, continuing advocacy could foster government buy-in of cash
transfers, and a contribution schedule could encourage increasing levels of government
support of cash transfers going forward.

Component in Madagascar
1. Introduction
In late 2016, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), in partnership with the Ministry
of Population, Social Protection and Promotion of Women (MPPSPF) and in coordination
with the Development Intervention Fund (FID), undertook an adolescent-focused cash
transfer to support children’s education as they transition from primary school to secondary
school. The Let Us Learn (LUL) transfer programme (in Malagasy, Ndao Hianatra) is a
supplemental transfer that supports older siblings of children benefiting from the Monetary
Transfer for Human Development (TMDH). UNICEF designed the LUL programme in
response to the increasing school dropout rates beginning at roughly age 11.
UNICEF Madagascar contracted the American Institutes for Research (AIR) to design and
implement an impact evaluation of the programme in 2016. The evaluation of the LUL cash
transfer supplement is a mixed-methods study comprised of a 4.5-year randomised controlled
trial (RCT) with both longitudinal and cross-sectional elements and a qualitative process
evaluation. The purpose of the evaluation is to learn if and how the programme impacts the
lives of beneficiary households, particularly for children, for an array of outcomes including
school enrolment, consumption, child labour, and parents’ expectations (a complete list of
outcomes is included in this report). On a broader level, the evaluation aims to learn lessons
about implementation that will inform the future of the programme, as well as inform policy
makers and donors about the impacts of the programme.
For the baseline (2016) and midline (2018) rounds, AIR was responsible for LUL impact
study design, analysis of data, report writing, and collaborating with UNICEF to disseminate
results. ideas42, a global research firm, was hired by UNICEF to oversee data collection
activities at baseline and midline. Ideas42 was responsible for programme design and
sampling structure—they identified programme communes, randomly assigned treatment
arms, established data collection sample sizes, and oversaw data collection activities. In turn,
ideas42 hired CAETIC Développement, a locally based research and data collection
organisation, to oversee and coordinate quantitative data collection.
The midline evaluation found low take-up rates of the LUL programme (63 per cent of
eligible households), which compromised the transfer’s ability to improve schooling for all
households and the evaluation’s ability to detect programme impacts (AIR, 2019). Based on
these results, UNICEF decided to redefine the focus and scope of the evaluation. At endline,
UNICEF included additional research questions focused on identifying implementation
constraints through qualitative methods. UNICEF also included additional research questions
on relevance to better align the evaluation to UNICEF and UNEG evaluation norms. Further,
UNICEF requested that AIR take over responsibility for overseeing data collection activities
at endline (previously under ideas42).
This endline evaluation is summative in nature and includes the endline round of survey data
collection and an in-depth qualitative approach focused on the implementation of the
programme. The primary goal of this endline report is to assess the relevance, effectiveness,
efficiency, impacts, coherence, and sustainability of the LUL programme.

2. Background
The LUL transfer programme is part of an international initiative in five countries aiming to
increase equity in education programming. In Madagascar, the LUL programme focused on
providing cash transfers to encourage the transition from primary to secondary school as well
as to improve the education environment through school construction and teacher trainings.
2.1. Existing evidence
Cash transfer programmes are a common method of social protection used to increase access
to schooling, healthcare, and productive assets. Such transfers can be provided with or
without conditionalities attached (i.e., behavioural requirements that need to be met in order
to receive the cash). There is extensive literature on the effects of cash transfer programmes
on education and broader wellbeing outcomes in developing countries, with each providing
reviews of the literature on impacts on education (Baird, Ferreira, Özler, & Woolcock, 2014;
Fiszbein & Schady, 2009; Saavedra & Garcia, 2012). The systematic reviews and meta-
analyses referenced herein find that cash transfer programmes yield an average 6 per cent
improvement in school enrolment and a 3 per cent improvement in student attendance, with
transfers conditional on schooling attendance boasting even larger impacts. Effect sizes on
schooling outcomes have been found to depend in part on the size of the transfer and access
to schools.
Since launching its Social Framework in 2012, UNICEF has become one of the leading
funders of cash transfer programming around the world with over 100 country offices
supporting cash transfer programming by 2015 (UNICEF, 2017). UNICEF supports social
transfers as a means of social protection, especially for children, due to their predictable
nature and ability to protect households from the impacts of shocks and to support the
accumulation of human capital, productive and financial assets. Further, UNICEF has found
cash transfers to be one of the preferred methods of delivering social protection in many
countries as they are often cross-cutting programmes which support a variety of sectors
(UNICEF, 2017).
Many cash transfer studies demonstrate that improving a household’s food consumption, as
well as its access to basic needs such as healthcare, decreases the demand for children to
contribute to income generation and household chores (de Hoop & Rosati, 2014; Kilburn et
al., 2017). Additionally, several studies demonstrate the connection between decreased child
labour and increased school outcomes. Reduced child labour is one goal of the programme;
however, it also serves as a possible pathway to improving educational outcomes, as
demonstrated in several studies (Dammert, 2010; Handa et al., 2017; Khanam, & Ross, 2011;
Kookana et al., 2016; Nonoyama-Tarumi).
A large literature demonstrates the effects of cash transfers on child health, especially when
the cash programme targets children (De Groot, Handa, Ragno, & Spadafora, 2017;
Hirvonen, Bossuyt, & Pigois, 2017; Huang et al., 2017). Similar to food consumption,
improved child health represents an important step along the causal pathway to increased
school enrolment and attendance (Alderman, Behrman, Lavy, & Menon, 2001; Bobonis,
Miguel, & Puri-Sharma, 2006; Glewwe, Jacoby, & King, 2001; Miguel & Kremer, 2004;
Saps et al., 2018; Trinies, Chang, Garn, & Freeman, 2016).

2.2. Overview of intervention
As one of the poorest countries in Africa, 75 per cent of Malagasy people live below the
international poverty line of $1.90 in 2019 (World Bank, n.d.). Furthermore, 67.6 per cent of
Malagasy children are reportedly multidimensionally poor, meaning that they suffer material
deprivation in at least two different dimensions of well-being (Silva-Leander, 2020). Overall,
the country is ranked 164 out of 189 countries and territories on the Human Development
index, with a value of 0.528 (UNDP, 2020). Extreme poverty is further aggravated by natural
and environmental disasters, such as cyclones and drought. For example, Southern
Madagascar is facing its fourth consecutive year of droughts, the effects of which are
expected to quadruple child malnutrition in the region (UNICEF & WFP, 2021). In 2020, the
COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic has affected Madagascar’s upward economic growth
experienced over the last three years, potentially reverting recent declines in poverty rates. As
such, the World Bank Board of Directors approved in September 2020 a US$75 million
development plan to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on vulnerable
households (World Bank, n.d.).
Generally speaking, children in Madagascar lack opportunities to receive adequate support in
health and education. Only 76 per cent of children are enrolled in primary education, with
23.7 per cent repeating Grade 1 (World Bank, 2018). Disparities in school enrolment remain
strikingly high between the poorest and the richest children. With almost 80 per cent of the
country residing in rural areas, 21 per cent of primary school aged-children are out of school
children compared to 6 per cent of children in urban areas (World Bank, 2018). In addition,
compared to 9 per cent in other low-income countries, Madagascar’s per pupil expenditure
(PPE) in primary education as a percentage of GDP per capita is 7 per cent (World Bank,
2018). Thus, stressing the need for further investment in the education sector.
The existing literature on education in Madagascar suggests that large, structural problems
limit the effectiveness of schooling. The literature lacks evidence on education-focused cash
transfers in Madagascar. However, we can find more robust evidence on education more
broadly. Households in Madagascar seem not to understand the value of school achievement.
Glick and Sahn (2006) found that households are very sensitive to the cost of schooling. Poor
households in particular are more likely to withdraw their children from school as it becomes
costlier. Households also appear to have a poor understanding of the returns on education.
Nguyen (2008) found that people in Madagascar do not know how much children benefit
from education. However, when presented with this information, individuals begin to enrol
their children in school. This effect is particularly strong when individuals lack a role model
of someone who successfully completed school. Evidence also indicates that school
management suppresses school enrolment in Madagascar (Lassibille, Tan, Jesse, & Van
Nguyen, 2010). When individual schools reformed their management structure to improve
pedagogical practices, student enrolment, attendance, and grade repetition all improved.
In recent years, the government of Madagascar has been gradually developing a social
protection system to better responds to the needs of its population. In 2014, the Malagasy
government ranked last in the UNDP Social Protection Index for Africa, spending only 0.7
percent of its GDP on social protection (UNICEF, 2021). In order to encourage increased
investment in social protection, the government elaborated a National Social Protection
Policy in 2015 which focused on 4 axes:

Axis 1: Increasing the incomes of the poorest

programmes were launched by the MPPSPF, in collaboration with the FID as implementing
partner, World Bank as a funder for TMDH, and UNICEF Madagascar’s support as a
technical assistance partner and funder for the LUL conditional cash transfer programme.
UNICEF’s contribution to this project reflects the organisation’s commitment to promote
access to quality and fair education as an indispensable human right alongside other
fundamental rights such as nutrition, health, and access to water and sanitation. This
programme is aligned with sustainable development goal 4, “to ensure inclusive and
equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities to all.”
The TMDH provides a conditional cash transfer to households with young children not yet in
school and a transfer to households with primary school-aged children conditional on school
attendance. The TMDH programme targets areas with low school enrolment rates, high
malnutrition, and common food insecurity. The TMDH programme is available to eligible
households regardless of their child’s gender. While boys and girls often have equivalent
barriers to school enrolment (e.g., school fees, uniform fees, materials), girls and boys often

high malnutrition, and common food insecurity. The TMDH programme is available to
eligible households regardless of their child’s gender. While boys and girls often have
equivalent barriers to school enrolment (e.g., school fees, uniform fees, materials), girls and
boys often face different barriers related to school attendance (e.g., parental preference,
safety, labour, caretaking responsibilities, etc.). Out of 53 candidate communes, 39
communes (within six districts across four provinces) were randomly chosen for TMDH
eligibility during an event including representatives of each locality. Thirty-nine thousand
beneficiaries live in the districts of Mahanoro and Toamasina II in the east, the district of
Vohipeno in the southeast, the district of Betioky Atsimo in the south, and the districts of
Faratsiho and Ambohimahasoa in the central plateau. Each district was selected based on
levels of low school enrolment, malnutrition, and food insecurity.
Within each TMDH commune, all villages receive the TMDH transfer. Each village in a
transfer commune formed a social protection committee to identify all households that met
the four TMDH pre-eligibility criteria: (a) be a village resident, (b) have a child 10 years of
age or younger, (c) be amongst the most in need according to the committee, and (d) be
validated as such by the community. Each pre-eligible household completed a proxy means
test to determine the household’s vulnerability level. Households deemed vulnerable by the
proxy means test could register for the TMDH.
All beneficiaries receive the TMDH on a monthly basis. It provides a monthly transfer of
15,000 Ariary (approximately 3.30 USD) to poor households with children up to age 10. The
TMDH transfer further provides a 5,000 Ariary ($1.65) per child enrolled in/attending
primary school regardless of gender. Households maintain eligibility if they have a child
under 6 years old or if they have a 6- to 10-year-old child who attends primary school 80
per cent of the time. The TMDH programme does not differentiate based on the child’s
gender; these transfers should focus on the goals of supporting children’s introduction to
primary school and promoting improved nutrition amongst younger children.
The LUL conditional cash transfer was designed to provide a second cash transfer to TMDH
beneficiary households with older children in order to promote transition to and continued
enrolment in secondary school. Indeed, while 65.9 per cent of children in Madagascar
completed primary school in 2018, UNESCO reports that only 27.5 per cent enrolled in
secondary school in 2019 (UNESCO, n.d.). The transition from primary school (7ème) to
lower secondary school (6ème) at roughly 10 years of age is a point at which many students
leave school. UNICEF identified three goals for LUL:
1) A substantial number of girls and boys registered in school and the dropout rate is
reduced
2) A large proportion of children have access to basic education, especially the most
excluded children
3) Social protection dialogues are in place as well as measures to incorporate social
protection into relevant programme areas
The LUL supplement transfer is part of a greater LUL programme that also distributes
learning materials and is supporting a remedial education program entitled Cours de Remise à
Niveau (CRAN). This evaluation, however, only focuses on the supplemental cash transfer
component of the program. UNICEF uses the LUL supplement transfer to extend the support
of TMDH to benefit older siblings of lower secondary school age. From the 39 TMDH
communes, 20 were randomly assigned to receive the LUL supplement during a separate
12 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection
Component in Madagascar
drawing involving local representatives. To qualify, potential beneficiaries must meet TMDH
criteria and (a) have a child in the final year of primary school or (b) have a child of 11 to 17
years of age who has neither completed lower secondary school nor dropped out of school in
the past year. Thus, all LUL recipients have at least two children—one younger (TMDH
beneficiary child) and one older (LUL beneficiary child). The eligibility criteria and
conditions of the LUL and TMDH transfers are summarised in Table 1.
The LUL and TMDH transfers began in October 2016 and continued throughout the 2016–
2017, 2017–2018, 2018–2019, 2019–2020, and 2020–2021 school years and the LUL transfer
will end in its current form in August 2021. As of February 2021, 7,945 households received
the LUL programme (FID, n.d.). Some areas have more LUL eligible children than others;
the largest district is Faratsiho, with 4,575 LUL-recipient children, while the smallest is
Toamasina II, with 1,271 children eligible for the LUL supplement. Roughly half of LUL
supplement recipients have a single LUL-eligible child and half have multiple LUL-eligible
children. Throughout our analysis, we focus on households that have one or more eligible
children. This conditions requires that the household has a child who is between 11 and 18
years of age and has completed enough years of school that they could enrol in secondary
school. The present is a summative evaluation of the programme’s implementation. This
evaluation of the LUL cash transfer supplement has been commissioned by UNCIEF. A
separate evaluation of TMDH will be commissioned by the World Bank.
The LUL supplement is a child-targeted transfer based on the child’s age and status in school
regardless of gender. First, households with a child in the final year of primary school receive
a 10,000 Ariary (approximately 3.30 USD) bonus at the beginning and again at the end of the
school year. Second, any household with a child attending lower secondary school receives
monthly transfers of 10,000 Ariary. Distribution of the money occurs in alternating months at
the same time the TMDH transfers occur. LUL transfers are conditioned on the child
attending school at least 80 per cent of the time. Thus, it is possible for a household to leave
the programme if the qualifying child drops out, finishes school, or dies.
It is important to note that, despite the closure of schools due to COVID-19 pandemic, the
social protection programme continued to provide financial support to the poorest
households. However, cash transfers were no longer conditional on school attendance during
the period of COVID-19 and school closures.

2.3. Theory of change
The LUL supplement transfer provides cash to households with older children to support
lower secondary school enrolment. All beneficiaries qualify for the LUL transfer because
they have both young and adolescent children. Also, the TMDH proxy means test determined
they were amongst the most vulnerable. For households at such low levels of consumption,
the marginal propensity to consume will be almost 100 per cent; that is, they will spend all of
any additional income rather than save it. Thus, we expect the immediate impact of the
programme will be to raise spending levels on school fees and associated school costs. With
any remaining money, beneficiaries would be able to increase spending on food, clothing,
and shelter, some of which will influence children’s health, nutrition, and material wellbeing.
Once immediate basic needs are met, and possibly after a period of time, the sustained influx
of cash beyond the cost of school may then trigger further responses within the household
economy; for example, by providing room for investment and other productive activity, the
use of school services for nontargeted siblings, the use of health or other social services, and
the ability to free up children from work in the time not spent in school.
The AIR research team collaborated with UNICEF to elaborate a conceptual framework that
shows how the LUL supplement can affect household activity, the causal pathways involved,
and the potential moderating factors (see Figure 2). This conceptual framework was validated
by the ERG during the first iteration of the inception phase (2016). The diagram is read from
left to right. The immediate impact of the transfer is to subsidise the cost of school fees so
enrolment is less costly or even free. If the value of the transfer exceeds the total cost of
education, including foregone wages earned by the child, then the household will have extra
money available to meet members’ basic needs or even invest in productive assets.
Sociological and economic theories of human behaviour suggest that the impact of the cash
may work through several mechanisms, including the quality of schools parents select for
their children, households’ proximity to those schools, and the amount paid for school fees.
Similarly, the impact of the cash transfer may be weaker or stronger depending on local
conditions in the community. These moderators include the child’s gender or disability status,
return on educational investment, parents’ time preferences and education level, and shocks.
We believe being a girl or disabled may make a child particularly vulnerable to exclusion
from the transfer’s benefits. Moderating effects are shown with dotted lines that intersect with
the solid lines to indicate that they can influence the strength of the direct effect.3
The next step in the causal chain is the effect on children, which we separate into effects on a
child’s educational outcomes, a child’s lifestyle outcomes, and parental outcomes, because
the transfer can affect different dimensions of a child’s life. It is important to recognise that
any potential impact of the programme on children must work through the household by its
effect on spending or time allocation decisions (including school attendance and use of other
services). The link between the household and children can also be moderated by
3 A mediator is a factor that can be influenced by the programme and so lies directly within the causal chain. A moderator, in
contrast, is not influenced by the programme. Thus, service availability is a moderator, whereas women’s bargaining power
may be either a moderator or a mediator depending on whether it is itself changed by the programme. Maternal literacy is a
moderator and not a programme outcome, unless the programme inspires caregivers to learn to read and write.
14 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection
Component in Madagascar
environmental factors, such as distance to schools, as indicated in the diagram, and
household-level characteristics themselves, such as the parents’ willingness to forego a
child’s current earnings. Indeed, from a theoretical perspective, some factors cited as
mediators may actually be moderators, such as women’s empowerment. We can test for
moderation versus mediation through established statistical techniques (Baron & Kenny,
1986), and this information will be important to help us understand the actual impact of the
programme on behaviour.
Figure 1 identifies some of the key indicators along the causal chain that we analyse in the
evaluation of the LUL supplement transfer. These measures are consistent with the log frame
of the project and are all measured using established items in existing national sample
surveys such as the Living Conditions Monitoring Survey (LCMS).

3. Evaluation purpose, objectives and scope
AIR designed a quantitative impact evaluation study beginning in 2016 in response to
UNICEF’s request to better understand how the LUL transfer supported children
transitioning to secondary school. In 2020, UNICEF requested an expanded scope to include
a qualitative process evaluation.
3.1. Evaluation purpose and intended users
As articulated in the Terms of Reference (TOR) included in Annex A, the summative
evaluation serves two primary purposes. First, the evaluation will be used by primary users,
including UNICEF Madagascar, FID, MPPSPF, to inform the future of the LUL programme.
The secondary users include partners, policy makers, donors, UNICEF ESARO and
Headquarters. It is expected that the evaluation can inform users about the impact that the
national programme has had on reducing the vulnerability of poor people in Madagascar. In
this sense, the results and lessons learned from the evaluation will be used to inform the
development of the national social protection system in Madagascar. From this perspective,
the intended users of this evaluation include MPPSPF, the Ministry of National Education,
FID, the UNICEF Madagascar Country Office, and the World Bank, as known as the duty
bearers for the evaluation.
3.2. Evaluation objectives
As stated in the TOR, the general objective of the consultancy is to conduct impact and
process evaluations of the LUL component of the TMDH programme. The primary objective
of the evaluation is to assess the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impacts, coherence, and
sustainability of the LUL programme.
3.3. Scope of the evaluation
The evaluation aims to assess the TMDH programme and the LUL supplement on the
wellbeing of children and their families. We used three main methods for this evaluation:
desk review, primary quantitative data collection, and primary qualitative data collection. The
quantitative methods were used primarily to answer questions related to the programme’s
effectiveness and impact while qualitative methods focused on addressing questions related
to relevance, coherence, efficiency, and sustainability. Primary quantitative data was
collected over three time points: baseline (2016), midline (2018), and endline (2021).
For our quantitative approach, we conducted household surveys and child assessments of
eligible households in treatment and control communes in six districts: Ambohimahasoa,
Betioky, Faratsiho, Mahanoro, Toamasina II, and Vohipeno. These districts were selected
based on the roll out of the TMDH programme and the LUL supplement as well as the
geography, demographics, and socioeconomic conditions. We added additional quantitative
activities at endline in order to answer the new research questions laid out in the new TOR.
Specifically, we added an operational performance section to the household survey to assess
the fidelity of implementation of the programme, reliability of the transfers, or problems with
payment. The addition of this module enabled us to assess whether households viewed the
transfer as sufficiently large to enrol their children in school. We provide descriptive statistics
on these indicators to enrich our understanding of how the transfer’s implementation did or
did not work.
17 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection Component
in Madagascar
We also conducted a close examination of the MIS administrative payment records for
February 2021 to gain a better understanding of those who are not registered for the LUL
programme (i.e., take-up). A more thorough analysis of this data allows us to test whether
take up differs among populations of interest, such as across regions. Lastly, due to resource
limitations, we were unable to use quantitative methods to answer questions related to
programme efficiency. Calculating cost-effectiveness requires a special kind of analysis in
which the programme is broken down into components and the cost of each component is
rigorously estimated. While this type of analysis is possible, it would have required a
significant amount of additional effort and is thus outside the scope of this evaluation.
The qualitative data collection occurred along with the quantitative data collection at endline
(2021). AIR’s initial qualitative design included interviews and focus group discussions
(FGDs) at three levels: the central level (Antananarivo), the district level, and the
commune/village level. At the central level, AIR conducted key informant interviews (KIIs)
with selected UNICEF, FID, World Bank, and MPPSPF staff. At the district level, we
conducted KIIs with district education officials and district-level UNICEF, FID, and
MPPSPF staff. Finally, at the commune level we conducted KIIs with teachers and FGDs
with students and parents who are beneficiaries (also known as rights holders) of the LUL
programme. AIR purposefully selected three communes for qualitative data collection in each
of the two districts selected for the impact evaluation (total 6 communes).
In response to UNICEF’s changes to the TOR, AIR included FGDs with parents and out-of-
school children of non-beneficiary, LUL-eligible households in the qualitative sample. This
allowed us to understand the reasons for low take-up of the programme, as well as the
experiences of families who are eligible for the programme but have not become
beneficiaries. AIR conducted one FGD with non-beneficiary parents and one with out-of-
school children in each of the six selected communes for qualitative data collection (12 total).
Further, to understand how equity, gender equality, and human rights were incorporated into
the LUL programme design, AIR added a brief review of LUL programme documents. We
identified relevant programme documents, such as design plans and reports, in consultation
with UNICEF. Then, we reviewed these documents for content related to themes such as
gender, equity, and human rights. These documents shed light onto how well equity issues
were addressed by the programme and allowed us to triangulate information and perceptions
obtained through interviews.
4. Research design
AIR developed a mixed methods, longitudinal study design to fully assess the research
questions for this programme (see Section 3.2). The impact evaluation delivers the marginal
effects of the LUL cash transfer using a randomised control trial and difference in difference
model to estimate how the programme changed key outcomes from the 2016 baseline to the
2021 endline. The qualitative process evaluation relied on endline KIIs and FGDs to better
understand how stakeholders implemented the programme and to identify opportunities to
improve delivery in the future.

4.1. Evaluation questions
The stated purpose of the LUL social cash transfer programme is to promote adolescents’
transition from the end of primary school (7ème CM2) to the beginning of lower secondary
school (6ème). The mechanism is the LUL supplementary cash transfer, which provides
money to households with secondary school-aged children. First, the transfer will alleviate
the financial burden of school enrolment so parents can afford to send their children to
school. Therefore, it was important to test education-related outcomes, such as enrolment and
grade completion. Second, households may have extra money for other purposes if they are
left with more income after paying school costs than they would have had with the child out
of school. In this case, the household may increase spending to better meet children’s basic
needs, such as nutrition or clothing, or reduce the time the child spends working.
Furthermore, it was important to understand whether any effects of the LUL transfer last only
a short while or if it generates impacts throughout the duration of the transfer. Lastly,
households may change their behaviours and attitudes, so we captured parents’ expectations
and plans for the future.
The AIR team conducted an impact and process evaluation of the LUL transfer to identify
key lessons learned and opportunities for improvement. We examined the research questions
in the TOR, reviewed the updated Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) Criteria (which include a new category:
coherence) to aid us in meeting these objectives. The research questions can be categorised
into six primary themes: (a) relevance of the programme, (b) efficiency of programme
implementation, (c) effectiveness of the programme, (d) impact of the programme,
(e) coherence of the programme with national and international strategies and partners, and
(f) sustainability of the programme. We discuss the RQs for each theme in more detail next.
Relevance. Investigating the relevance of the TMDH-LUL cash transfer requires us to assess
the extent to which the programme incorporates the needs of school-aged children in
Madagascar, and to analyse whether the programme’s objectives and strategies were
formulated in a realistic and culturally appropriate way. The RQs under this theme test the
theory of change assumptions about programme inputs, such as alignment with the
government of Madagascar’s and UNICEF Madagascar’s country strategies.
Efficiency. Analysing the efficiency of programme implementation requires us to assess the
conditions for delivering the components of the programme for target beneficiaries. We
assessed the timeliness and accuracy of delivering transfer payments, main bottlenecks or
barriers to programme implementation, and the extent to which gender equality is considered
in the allocation of resources.
Effectiveness. Analysing effectiveness requires us to evaluate the extent to which
programme inputs and activities lead to outputs, such as increased enrolment for out-of-
school children and retention of those in school in the transition to secondary education. The
effectiveness of the transfer was measured based on the extent to which it achieves its
objective.
Impact. Analysing the impact of the LUL programme requires us to examine the extent to
which programme inputs translate into improved schooling outcomes including enrolment,
attendance, retention, and promotion, and household wellbeing outcomes such as
19 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection Component
in Madagascar
consumption, food security, and savings. Further, we assessed how these impacts are
distributed by gender and regional context.
Coherence. Analysing coherence requires us to determine the extent to which the transfer
programme is consistent with other national assistance programmes and strategies. We also
assessed whether and how the programme coordinates with other interventions and partners
to limit duplication of efforts, drawing lessons from our analysis of the programme’s
relevance and efficiency.
Sustainability. Analysing the sustainability of the LUL transfer programme requires us to
assess the delivery of inputs and programme activities, as well as the linkage between
activities and desired outputs, in order to determine the extent to which programme benefits
are likely to be sustained and replicated. We drew on lessons from other components of the
study (e.g., relevance, coherence, efficiency, effectiveness, and impact) to assess whether the
programme aligns with other social protection and assistance programmes in a way that
increases the likelihood that programme benefits will be sustained in the future.
We present the evaluation matrix in Annex D. The evaluation matrix summarizes all research
questions, indicators, and data sources. All research questions are from the TOR and were
developed by UNICEF. However, UNICEF shared additional questions with a revised TOR
during the endline phase (2020). All new questions include an asterisk in the
evaluation matrix.
4.2. Evaluation design
We developed a mixed-methods approach that included an impact evaluation with a multi-
armed RCT design and a qualitative process evaluation focused on the fidelity of programme
implementation. The impact evaluation generated impact estimates for the effect of the LUL
supplement on key outcomes affecting children. Qualitative information deepened our
understanding of programme impacts and also shed light on process or implementation issues
that potentially inhibited the programme’s impact. While the impact evaluation provides
information on the effect of the LUL transfer on beneficiaries, the qualitative process
evaluation helps us understand why and how the LUL component is succeeding, as well as
ways it could be improved.
The impact evaluation included three rounds of data collection: baseline (2016), midline
(2018), and endline (March-April 2021). The process evaluation included one round of data
collection which occurred at the same time as endline. The qualitative sampling and
instruments were deeply informed by midline impact evaluation results, which indicated low
rates of take-up in the LUL programme. Findings from the endline impact evaluation and the
qualitative process evaluation have been triangulated in this report. See Figure 2 below for a
summary of the evaluation design.

in Madagascar
Figure 2: Summary of Evaluation Design
21 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection Component in Madagascar
In this section, we present the research design for both components of the evaluation. We
begin by presenting the impact evaluation design, sampling, analysis plan, survey
instruments, key indicators, and data collection plan. Then, we describe the process
evaluation design, methodology, and sampling, followed by the analysis plan. We then
discuss the risks and limitations of our approach, as well as ethical considerations.
4.3. Impact evaluation
We conducted a quantitative analysis to identify how the LUL transfer affected households
after accounting for the effects of the TMDH transfer. To do so, we rely on the RCT design
of the LUL programme, in which communes randomly were assigned to the control, TMDH-
only, and LUL study arms so that we can compare the three groups without concern that there
may be systematic underlying differences that would confound our results.
4.3.1. Study design overview
The impact evaluation of UNICEF’s Let Us Learn supplement to the TMDH transfer was a
4.5year, mixed methods, multi-armed, RCT design. The study has generated impact estimates
for the effect of the TMDH transfer as well as the TMDH transfer + the LUL supplement on
key outcomes affecting children. It compares outcomes for households that receive no
transfer (control), households that receive the TMDH transfer but not the LUL supplement
(TMDH-only), and households that receive the TMDH and LUL transfers (LUL), hence the
necessity of the multi-arm design. The multilevel nature of the experimental design allowed
the evaluation team to test the separate impacts of each aspect of the transfer programme with
a view towards identifying the most effective treatments to be scaled as part of the future
national rollout of an expanded social protection programme.
An RCT is the most powerful research design for drawing conclusions about the impacts of
an intervention on specific outcomes. An RCT draws from a pool of comparable subjects and
then randomly assigns some to a treatment group that receives the intervention and others to a
control group that maintains “business as usual” against which comparisons can be made. An
RCT permits us to directly attribute any observed differences between the treatment and
control groups to the intervention; otherwise, other unobserved factors, such as motivation,
could have influenced members of a group to move into a treatment or control group
(Campbell & Stanley, 1963). Randomisation helps to ensure that both observed and
unobserved characteristics that may affect the outcomes are similar between the treatment
and control conditions of the sample. In a randomised experiment, treatment and control
groups are expected to be comparable (with possible chance variation between groups), so the
average differences in outcome between the two groups at the end of the study can be
attributed to the intervention.
Due to operational constraints, the cash transfer intervention itself was rolled out in two
waves. The first payment took place for the initial wave of 25,000 households in October
2015. The first payment for the second wave of 15,000 households was held in the following
years. This rollout lent itself nicely to an RCT design whereby eligible households in areas
not yet receiving the transfer could ethically serve as control households as they will receive
the intervention in the future.
22 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection Component
in Madagascar
In this report, we provide rigorous impact estimates because the treatment arm was randomly
assigned at the commune level using a two-step process (see Figure 3). During the first step,
38 of the 52 communes were randomly assigned to receive the TMDH transfer, while the
remaining 14 communes would receive no transfer. During the second step, 26 of the 38
communes were randomly assigned to receive the LUL supplement in addition to the TMDH
transfer. We can now compare outcomes for all three treatment arms because the random
assignment ensures that the communes were similar until the transfer began. Therefore, we
can attribute any differences at midline or endline to the transfer since it was assigned
randomly.4
Figure 3. Multi-Arm RCT Design
4 We understand that the delivery of the programme was compromised by the Covid-19 pandemic as well as other
unforeseen obstacles at the end of 2019. Even so, we will conduct the intent-to-treat analysis to assess the impact of the
programme on beneficiary households. We can further examine the impact by number of payments received in 2020 or other
relevant disaggregations that may help elucidate the impacts with greater fidelity of implementation, depending on the
heterogeneity in programme operations,

4.3.2. Sampling
The study included three rounds of Figure 4. Map of Study Areas by Treatment Status
data collection: the baseline round
was conducted in August and
September 2016, a one-year follow-
up was conducted in mid-2018, and
the endline took place in early 2021.
Households in both treatment and
control areas completed surveys.
ideas42 was responsible for the
sampling strategy and household
selection and both baseline and
midline. Baseline survey
respondents were randomly selected
by ideas42 from a roster of eligible
households. All survey respondents
qualified for the study by scoring
below a threshold set in a proxy
means test which occurred one to
two months before the baseline
survey. At baseline, 4,484
households participated in the
survey. Figure 4 shows the location
and treatment status of the 52
communes these households come
from. Our study focused only on a
subset of respondents—those
meeting both the TMDH and the
LUL inclusion criteria. We excluded households that do not meet LUL eligibility criteria. Of
the households surveyed at baseline, about 37 per cent of households were eligible for the
LUL supplement, meaning they have an 11- to 17-year-old child. Thus, at baseline we used
data only from 49 LUL supplement recipients in LUL communes and 21 LUL-eligible
observations in the TMDH-only and in the control communes.
The baseline survey was smaller than subsequent rounds of data collection. This difference
was due to ideas42’s plan to use baseline data primarily as a mechanism to test the balance
between the treatment arms and the logistical challenges of collecting largescale datasets in
new areas.
At midline, the sample increased to a total of 6,006 households. Between the baseline and
midline rounds, 3,650 household joined the study to increase its statistical power while
2,356 households were holdovers from baseline. The additional midline households were
randomly selected from a roster of eligible households. Table 2 shows the location of the
52 communes in the study by district.

At endline, AIR assumed control of the sampling strategy based on the samples surveyed in
the previous two rounds. Accordingly, we surveyed 2588 total households (1,455 from
midline plus 1,133 new randomly selected households). Of these households, 1602 were LUL
recipients (a 66.85 per cent increase from midline); 462 were LUL-eligible, TMDH-only
households; and 524 were LUL-eligible households from control communes (not receiving
either LUL or TMDH). We provide details of the calculations conducted to ascertain this
sample was sufficient to detect meaningful effects in the power calculations section below.
Power analysis
AIR believes it is important to design evaluations so that studies are sufficiently powered to
detect meaningful effects of the programme. We therefore present the results of a power
analysis to evaluate the effects of the TMDH and TMDH+ LUL using the methodology
described below. This study estimates the impacts of the LUL supplement and the TMDH
transfer on all recipients, including the effect for the subgroup of girls.
Effect of LUL supplement: The expected endline sample size of 1,099 LUL-recipient
households, 1,102 LUL-eligible TMDH-only households, and 395 LUL-eligible control
households enabled us to detect a marginal LUL effect (𝛽 ) of at least 0.215 standardised
2
mean difference for all children and 0.227 for the subsample of girls eligible for the LUL
supplement. We expected to detect these effects with 80 per cent likelihood and 95 per cent
confidence.
Effect of TMDH transfer: Using the same data to estimate the effect of TMDH on LUL-
recipient children enabled us to detect a TMDH effect (𝛽 ) as small as 0.210 standardised
1
mean difference for all children and 0.229 amongst the girls in the sample. We again
expected to detect these effects with 80 per cent likelihood and 95 per cent confidence. These
estimates relied on the same figure of 52 LUL-eligible households per commune.
Power analysis assumptions: The minimum detectable effect sizes for both LUL and TMDH
analyses were based on the below assumptions about in-sample parameters. The comparison
of TMDH-only beneficiaries to LUL-recipient beneficiaries identifies the marginal effect of
LUL. The comparison of control households to TMDH-only and LUL-beneficiary
households to control households identifies the effect of TMDH.
25 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection Component
in Madagascar
For both the all-children and girls-only samples, we expected that child-level background and
demographic data collected during the survey would explain 25 per cent of the total variation
for the longitudinal analysis. We expected they would predict only 10 per cent of the
variation for the cross-sectional analysis, since we would no longer use baseline observations.
We assumed commune-level data will explain 10 per cent of total variation.
We accounted for the correlation in child outcomes within a commune by calculating the
intracluster correlation (ICC). We found there was an ICC of 0.05 for primary school
completion (Morey, 2016). This parameter was based on the primary school completion of
young adults in central Madagascar, near but not including Faratsiho and Ambohimahasoa.
Existing data suggested that the average woman bears 4.4 children (United Nations, 2019).
Some of these children may have completed secondary school, some will not survive until
school age, and some will be too young for secondary school, so we assumed there would be
2 children of school-going age per household. There are 98.3 males per 100 females in rural
Madagascar (Institut National de la Statistique & Direction des Statistiques des Manges,
2010). We assumed there will be one girl out of the two children, on average, per LUL
beneficiary or eligible household.
4.3.3. Analysis plan
The quantitative analysis is designed to provide the most rigorous estimates of the impact of
the LUL supplement. We used a multi-arm, cluster RCT design with difference-in-
differences (DID) regressions to test the effect of the TMDH and the TMDH + LUL
supplement on educational outcomes and household wellbeing. Our analysis relied on the
randomised assignment of communes to different study arms to create a counterfactual.
Because there are no underlying community characteristics that determine receipt of the LUL
supplement, we can derive impacts from a simple comparison of endline outcomes between
treatment and control. However, we use a DID design because that approach will control for
any idiosyncratic differences that remained after the randomization process. Furthermore, we
use time-invariant household-level characteristics to further improve the precision of our
estimates. For a full discussion of the quantitative analysis plan, please see Annex H.
The results of all impact analyses are located in Annex G. For impact results, we present two
different estimates plus descriptive statistics of the three study arms. The first column of
numbers represent the marginal effect of receiving the LUL supplement. This result is the
primary estimate from which we derive our conclusions. It provides us a measure of the
change in the outcome that we can attribute to receiving the LUL supplement. The second
column of numbers provides the base impact of receiving the TMDH transfer amongst those
households that are also eligible for the LUL supplement. Because this study focuses only on
a subset of TMDH recipients, this result cannot be interpreted as the overall impact of
TMDH. Finally, we present the mean outcome value and sample size for the LUL, TMDH-
only, and control groups, respectively. These descriptive statistics provide the overall average
of the outcome at endline. While the impact estimates should capture the differences between
the groups due to the programme, the impact estimates will not simply equal the differences
between the mean values. The reason for this disconnect is that the impact estimates are more
sophisticated by using the DID model to control from any differences at baseline and
individual characteristics that will improve the precision of the impact estimates.

in Madagascar
4.3.4. Survey instrument
All quantitative analysis relied on household-level survey data and review of administrative
data such as the MIS. During each round of data collection, selected households completed a
multidimensional survey. The survey covered basic household information, food
consumption and expenditure, non-food item consumption and expenditure, other
expenditures, agricultural production, income sources, gender and social equity, and food
security. Due to the length of this instrument, we present a brief description of each section
separately while the full tool is provided in Annex E.
In collaboration with UNICEF and data-collection partners, AIR contributed questions to the
survey that would enrich the planned analysis of the LUL supplement. These questions
focused on the educational attainment of children, community educational infrastructure, and
parents’ or guardians’ attitudes toward education.
Household roster: This section contains demographic and educational information about all
members of the household. There is a particular focus on education of all members—adults
and youths—because it is relevant to LUL programme objectives.

4.3.5. Key indicators
We planned to evaluate three domains of children’s outcomes: (a) child in-school outcomes,
(b) child out-of-school outcomes, and (c) parents’ attitudes toward children. Each of these
topics measured a separate dimension of the LUL goal to promote children’s secondary
school registration and to reduce the dropout rate. The goal of this evaluation is to understand
the direct impacts of providing the LUL supplement to existing TMDH beneficiaries. As
such, the findings discussed in Section 6 compare LUL beneficiaries to those only receiving
TMDH rather than the national levels or to Government of Madagascar targets.
We estimated the effect of the LUL and of TMDH for multiple groups of interest. Our
primary analysis tested the impact of key indicators on the overall beneficiary population. We
also tested the impact for subgroups that are particularly vulnerable, such as girls and the
disabled. This focus enabled us to better understand how access to basic education changed
28 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection Component
in Madagascar
for all children. We used qualitative data at endline to explore which types of children may be
vulnerable and will investigate these characteristics quantitatively.
We thoroughly investigated children’s secondary school attendance, grade completion, and
future enrolment plans. The overall objective of the LUL programme is to facilitate children’s
transition from primary to secondary school. We used these measures to evaluate whether the
LUL supplement effectively increased children’s presence in school in very directly
measured ways.
We tested the impact of the LUL transfer on the children’s use of time and access to basic
goods and services. When children’s basic needs are met, they are more likely to succeed in
school (Martorell et al., 2010). We tested whether the transfer increased the availability of food
and household items and whether children were allowed to dedicate their time to school
activities even when not in class.
We investigated the programme’s effect on parents’ expectations for their child’s educational
attainment and the age at which the child will marry. These questions measured whether
parents’ intrinsic value of education has changed.
4.3.6. Quantitative data collection
There were three rounds of quantitative data collection: baseline (August through September
2016, midline (mid-2018), and endline (early 2021). The baseline data collection was
necessary to measure the starting place of the LUL recipients, TMDH-only recipients, and the
control group before any cash transfers have been paid. These data provided a detailed
description of beneficiaries and enabled the evaluation team to perform the pre-analysis tests
described above. It is vital that the baseline data was collected before the treatment group
received payments. Some short-term indicators such as school enrolment, consumption, and
child labour were likely impacted by the programme soon after receiving payments; thus, we
needed to conduct the baseline survey before these impacts occurred to ensure that we
properly measure the full impacts of the programme, otherwise benefits from the programme
that took effect in the short term would be lost and not attributed to the cash transfers.
The follow-up rounds occurred one and four years post baseline. These periods allowed
adequate time for the programme to have a measurable effect. It takes time for a measurable
difference to occur between the treatment and control groups for many important indicators,
such as health or investment in livestock. The midline study captured the short-term impacts of
the first year of the transfer, while mitigating concerns about seasonality since it occurred at the
same time of year as the baseline. This endline study captures the longer-term impacts four
years after the transfers began.
Baseline data collection began in August 2016, as soon as beneficiaries were selected from
the candidate pool using a proxy means test survey. CAETIC Developpement was
responsible for logistics and conducting the actual surveys, while ideas42 was contracted to
supervise the process and serve as the ultimate authority. Data collection rolled out in a
staggered schedule, with baseline collection occurring as soon as proxy means tests were
complete; the districts of Betioky Atsimo and Toamasina II were the first, followed by
Vohipeno and Mahanoro, and lastly, Ambohimahasoa and Faratsiho.
29 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection Component
in Madagascar
Midline sample design and data collection were again the responsibility of ideas42 with
support from CAETIC Developpement. AIR contributed advice and input to the data-
collection planning process, and sent a representative to observe all rounds of data collection.
For endline, AIR assumed sole responsibility for sample design, data collection, and
oversight and contracting of CAETIC Developpement. Due to COVID-19 travel restrictions,
we provided remote oversight and support to CAETIC staff in Madagascar and attended
training via Microsoft Teams.
4.4. Process evaluation
The process evaluation complements findings from the impact evaluation by deepening our
understanding of programme impacts and shedding light on implementation issues that could
potentially affect impacts. In addition, the process evaluation also identifies ways in which
the LUL programme could be improved. In this section, we present the process evaluation
design, methodology, sampling, and analysis plan.
4.4.1. Study design overview
The process evaluation design included one round of qualitative data collection at the central,
district, and commune/village levels, which occurred in March 2021. AIR collected
qualitative data from LUL beneficiaries (children and parents); teachers; non-beneficiary,
LUL-eligible households (children and parents); implementing partners; and other relevant
key stakeholders.
Qualitative inquiry is particularly strong for investigating processes because of its descriptive
and discursive nature. Specifically, qualitative methods are uniquely appropriate for process
evaluations because:
1. Depicting process requires detailed descriptions of what happens and how people engage
with one another.
2. People’s experience of processes typically varies in important ways, so respondents’
experiences and perceptions of their experiences need to be captured in their own words.
3. The process is fluid and dynamic, so it cannot be fairly summarised on a single rating
scale at one point in time.
4. The process may be the outcome (Patton, 2014).
Furthermore, qualitative data collection is well suited to informing process evaluations
because it enables the researchers to explore not only formal activities and anticipated
outcomes but informal patterns and unanticipated interactions (Patton, 2014). Qualitative data
gives the researcher flexibility to explore unforeseen areas of interest to understand where
elements of programme implementation may have affected impacts. The process evaluation
illuminates strengths and challenges associated with implementing an intervention, as well as
how beneficiaries experience the programme and translate lessons learned into practice.
4.4.2. Methodology and sampling
We collected qualitative data through interviews and focus groups at three levels: the central
level (Antananarivo), the district level, and the commune/village level. Data collected at the
central and district levels will be limited to KIIs with selected UNICEF, FID, and MPPSPF
staff, as well as other implementers and education officials. In consultation with UNICEF,
30 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection Component
in Madagascar
AIR purposefully selected two out of the six districts of the impact evaluation sample for
qualitative data collection based on LUL take up rates and performance in key outcomes from
the midline evaluation. Mahanoro was selected as a higher performing district, and
Ambohimahasoa was selected as a lower performing district. Within those two districts, AIR
purposively selected three communes, for a total of six communes, based on performance on
key outcomes from the midline evaluation. A full list of the districts and communes is
presented in the table below.

At the commune level, we interviewed key informants (teachers and local education
officials), beneficiaries (children and parents), and LUL-eligible non-beneficiaries (children
and parents).
AIR worked with ATW International (located in Antananarivo) to collect data for the
qualitative portion of this study. AIR co-led the enumerator training, and ATW led
enumerator recruitment, piloting, and data collection with AIR’s supervision. Given our
inability to travel due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, AIR worked to ensure constant
communication and supervision of ATW during training and data collection. AIR participated
in enumerator training remotely (through Microsoft teams) and oversaw piloting and data
collection via email and/or WhatsApp communication.
We used two primary methods for the qualitative data collection: FGDs and KIIs. Table 4
describes our qualitative data collection sampling for this study. All qualitative data
collection tools can be found in Annex D.

Desk review
AIR conducted a brief document review to address research questions related to relevance,
coherence, efficiency, and sustainability of the LUL programme. In consultation with
UNICEF, we identified and compiled relevant LUL programme design documents and
reports, UNICEF programmatic and strategic documents, and national social protection
strategy and policy documents. We reviewed these documents for content related to themes
such as the LUL programme’s relevance to government needs and priorities; alignment to
national social protection strategies and policies in Madagascar; integration of gender, human
rights, and equity into programme design; coherence and strength of partnerships with
national and international stakeholders; and potential for sustainability. We also reviewed
programme reports and records to determine the extent to which programme activities were
implemented as planned. These documents shed light into the relevance, coherence,
efficiency, and sustainability of the programme and enabled us to triangulate household
survey and qualitative interview data.
Key informant interviews
We conducted a total of 22 KIIs at the central, district, and commune levels. A key informant
is a person who possesses expert knowledge about the LUL programme or a topic related to
the programme. We interviewed key informants to investigate research questions related to
programme relevance, efficiency, coherence, and sustainability. We conducted KIIs with
selected UNICEF, FID, World Bank and MPPSPF staff overseeing the LUL component, as
well as other collaborators/implementers, at the national level (six KIIs), the province levels
(four KIIs) and district levels (three KIIs). In particular, interviews with UNICEF, MPPSPF,
World Bank and FID staff focused on the programme’s relevance to target groups, alignment
to government priorities and social protection policies in Madagascar, the extent to which the
programme was implemented as planned, coherence and leveraging of partnerships with
national and international stakeholders, and the extent to which support is likely to continue
after the programme ends. In addition, we conducted KIIs with district education officials
(two KIIs) and local education officials, teachers and directors from selected communes (ten
32 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection Component
in Madagascar
KIIs). These interviews focused on the programme’s relevance to target groups, the perceived
adequacy of the size and regularity of transfers (including the extent to which the size of the
transfer reflects the needs of scholarship recipients), and the integration of concerns about
equal participation in the programme implementation. Interviews with district education
officials and teachers also explored perceived barriers to school enrolment from potentially
LUL-eligible households.
Focus group discussions
To address research questions related to programme relevance, efficiency, and impact, AIR
conducted focus groups with beneficiaries (six FGDs with children and six FGDs with
parents) and non-beneficiaries (six FGDs with children and six FGDs with parents), for a
total of 24 FGDs. Focus groups are guided discussions with a group of purposively selected
individuals that create a context in which participants feel comfortable and empowered to
discuss the research topics with their peers and the carefully trained facilitators, and react to
each other’s opinions and experiences with the programme. Focus groups are typically
conducted with groups of six to eight participants. The format enables the team to understand
the experiences of a greater number of intended beneficiaries in a short period of time, in a
group environment with their peers where we can observe interactions amongst participants.
Focus groups are typically ideal for beneficiary-level participants, where the format will
reflect a broader range of experiences with programme implementation.
FGDs with parents in beneficiary households explored the perceived relevance of the LUL
cash component to target groups, including the perceived adequacy of the size of the transfer
and to what extent it reflects beneficiary households’ needs. Beneficiary FGDs also provided
information on the efficiency of the programme, such as the extent to which programme
activities were implemented as planned, the reported frequency and timeliness of payments
received by respondents, and their perceptions of the effectiveness and timeliness of the
management of payment delivery. Further, beneficiary FGDs investigated perceived impacts
of the programme, including unintended impacts. FGDs with beneficiary children
investigated their understanding of the programme, their experiences attending school and
helping out in the household, and their school aspirations.
FGDs with non-beneficiary, potentially LUL-eligible parents and children explored barriers
to school enrolment and programme uptake, including administrative barriers. We ensured
the inclusion of diverse perspectives within the focus groups by recruiting similar numbers of
male and female beneficiaries, and also including non-beneficiaries as part of our sample.
4.4.3. Qualitative data analysis
AIR adheres to strict data analysis principles, regardless of the type of data being collected.
All data from KIIs, and FGDs was coded and analysed using the NVivo qualitative software
programme. We created a preliminary coding outline and structure on the basis of the
research questions, interview protocols, and memos of ideas that emerged during data
collection. This coding outline served as the tool to organise and subsequently analyse the
information gathered in the interviews and focus groups. The outline was a living document
that was modified as new themes and findings emerge during data analysis. A list of
definitions for the codes accompanied the outline, so that coders categorise data using the
same standards. After inputting the raw data into NVivo, coders selected a sample of
interviews to double code, to ensure inter-rater reliability. The team subsequently input the
data into the thematic structure. The qualitative team used grounded theory (Strauss &
33 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection Component
in Madagascar
Corbin, 1998) to identify themes, categories, and theories that emerge from the data and that
confirm or refute the researchers’ initial impressions. That is, rather than basing the analysis
on a hypothesis, the researchers created concepts and categories based on the data, refining
the concepts as they go along to eventually inform the overall findings. First, the research
team did a round of open coding to classify the data according to the coding structure and any
additional themes that emerge from the data. Then, the research team did a round of axial
coding to characterise the prevalence of responses, examine differences amongst groups, and
identify key findings and themes related to the research questions. These key findings and
themes identified through axial coding, along with narrative examples and quotes from
research participants, formed the basis of qualitative findings for the report. For the document
review, the evaluation team identified relevant information from selected documents and
exported these data into an Excel spreadsheet structured by themes of interest. Then the
evaluation team distilled document review findings to answer specific research questions. We
analysed document review findings alongside qualitative data from KIIs and FGDs and,
where relevant, household survey data, to ensure that we triangulated and added depth to
interview and survey data.
4.5. Methodological limitations
There are several unavoidable limitations despite the rigorous RCT design. We discuss these
limitations because they affect how we interpret the findings. We identified seven primary
limitations to the study:
1. The LUL transfer targets, among others, children who have already dropped out of school
and we are less likely to detect impacts for that group. Children out of school face
additional barriers to reenrolment that make them less likely to reenrol. For example, a
child may have forgotten some of the material they learned before dropping out. Or, they
may have to purchase new school uniforms, notebooks, or other materials instead of
being able to reuse them from their previous year in school. When we estimate the
impacts of the programme on eligible children, we cannot distinguish between those out
of school and those still enrolled in school, and who do not face these additional barriers.
2. We could not secure the transfer of a full history of administrative transfer records, so it
was not possible for us to characterize the typical payment delay. FID provided the AIR
team via UNICEF with February TMDH and LUL payment records. These limited data
helped us to understand one instance of payment delays but not the broader challenges
faced by recipients who may have faced regular, extended delays. While we cannot
provide reliable findings on the history of delays, we mitigate this risk by presenting
mixed methods results confirming that beneficiaries regularly experienced delays (62 per
cent) and triangulating this with beneficiary interviews documenting the challenges these
delays posed.
3. Households may have reacted to their treatment status before the baseline survey. The
randomisation event that assigned communes to their treatment status occurred before
baseline data collection. This event was public, so commune officials knew whether or
not their residents would receive the transfer. If this information was relayed to survey
respondents, they might have changed their answers based on the knowledge that they
would (or would not) receive a transfer. LUL households might have already begun
behaving as though they would receive the transfer by baseline. If they did change their
behaviour before baseline, then we would not capture the full impact of the transfer. For
example, a household might have already increased consumption, knowing that they
would soon be eligible for the transfer. Then we would mistakenly think their
34 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection Component
in Madagascar
consumption at baseline was higher than it would have been without anticipating the
transfer. Households in the control or TMDH group might have reacted in the opposite
direction. If households changed their responses in anticipation, then we likely would be
underestimating the impact of the LUL. However, households in rural areas are
disconnected from high-level commune officials, so most households probably knew little
of their treatment status.
4. Our research design included only one round of qualitative data collection, which gives us
a snapshot of implementation at a given time but does not allow us to fully understand
how implementation has changed or evolved over time. This is especially challenging
given that qualitative data collection occurred during the COVID pandemic, which has
directly affected programme implementation. While we asked key stakeholders about the
trajectory of the programme, respondents often cited issues related to the COVID
pandemic and other emergencies which were happening at the time of data collection,
which were front of mind for them. To mitigate this risk, whenever possible we
triangulate between information gathered from interviews with programme
documentation to understand how programme implementation evolved over time.
5. Due to travel restrictions during the COVID pandemic, the AIR team was not able to
travel to Madagascar to train the ATW team and conduct high-level key stakeholder
interviews in person. To mitigate this risk and ensure the quality of data collection, AIR
developed a rigorous online training and maintained constant communication with ATW
via WhatsApp and email during data collection. In addition, we reviewed interview
transcripts on a rolling basis to provide feedback and points of improvement to ATW
researchers. Travel restrictions did not pose as much of a challenge to quantitative data
collection training, since CAETIC had successfully completed two previous rounds of
data collection for the LUL evaluation and was thus well experienced and familiar with
the study area and instruments.
6. Qualitatively, it was challenging to disentangle the perceived impacts of LUL from
TMDH. Although we asked beneficiaries about the impacts of LUL, responses indicated
that people were often talking about both programmes together when describing how
LUL had impacted their livelihoods. This means that our findings on perceived impacts of
LUL may also include some perceived impacts of TMDH. However, our quantitative
approach allows us to successfully disentangle the impacts of LUL from those of TMDH.
Therefore, we often present the larger perceived impacts of LUL after discussing the
quantitative findings on impact.
7. Most studies are vulnerable to biases that can affect the validity of findings. One of the
key biases that this study must address is selection bias, in which case certain types of
individuals are more likely to receive the treatment than others. Our study is likely
resilient to selection bias due the experimental design. Furthermore, we found relatively
few cases of contamination where households in control or TMDH-only communes
reported having received the transfer. There are other potential sources of bias, such as
social desirability bias where respondents misrepresent outcomes to reflect a response
that they suspect is preferred by data collectors or implementers. For example,
respondents may be more likely to report their children enrolling in school than was true.
However, this trend would have applied to respondents across the three groups and if
there were different levels of social desirability bias, it likely would have biased our
results to zero which provides even more confidence in our findings.

4.6. Ethical considerations
AIR conducts rigorous ethical reviews through its IRB for all of its own internal research
activities and provides this service for a variety of subcontractors and collaborators. AIR’s
IRB has conducted expedited and full board reviews of research involving human subjects for
more than 25 years. AIR is registered with the Office for Human Research Protections
(OHRP) as a research institution and conducts research under its own Federalwide
Assurance. The AIR IRB follows the standards set forth by the American Evaluation
Association’s Guiding Principles and the Joint Committee on Standards for Educational
Evaluation. Three general principles define these standards: (1) evaluators will conduct
evaluations legally and ethically, taking into account the welfare of those involved in the
evaluation, as well as the general public; (2) evaluators will conduct evaluations in a
competent and efficient fashion that will lead to reliable and accurate results; and
(3) evaluators will design evaluations and report the results in a manner that is useful and
appropriate to the intended audience. Clear guidelines exist regarding the expectations with
which local data collectors must comply (e.g., how to document informed consent, how to
store and restrict access to physical files and electronic data files and how to treat identifiable
information).
AIR follows the United Nation’s Evaluation Group’s (UNEG) Code of Conduct, which
requires both a conflict- and gender-sensitive approach to research and adherence to the “do
no harm” principle, as well as transparency, confidentiality, accuracy, accountability and
reliability, among other key principles which are further described below. AIR also adheres
to UNICEF’s Procedure for Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation, Data Collection and
Analysis. Specifically, with regard to the protection of vulnerable individuals and
communities, AIR respects and adheres to the United Nation’s Universal Declaration of
Human Rights; the UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees; the United Nation’s
Convention on the Rights of the Child; and the United Nation’s Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women; as well as other human rights
conventions and national legal codes that respect local customs and cultural traditions,
religious beliefs and practices, personal interaction, gender roles, disability, age and ethnicity.
We obtained approval from the AIR IRB prior to data collection. Please see Annex E for the
approval letters. The following outlines how we (a) obtained consent for qualitative data,
(b) maintained confidentiality for all research, (c) managed and reported any adverse events
during qualitative collection, (d) implemented our COVID-19 mitigation plan, and (e) respect
for beliefs, human rights, gender equity, and the ‘do no harm’ principle
4.6.1. Consent
Prior to participating in qualitative data collection activities, team leaders introduced the
study and obtained informed verbal consent from them. Adults were asked directly for
permission to include them in the study and parents or guardians were asked for permission
for their children to participate in the study. Youth aged 13 years or older were asked to give
their assent. Participants were informed that the information they shared was confidential and
would not be shared with anyone, and that their participation was voluntary, and they could
end their participation at any time or skip any questions they did not wish to answer.
Informed verbal consent/assent was obtained from each participant after the consent form
was read to him or her. All informed consent forms can be found in Annex J.
36 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection Component
in Madagascar
4.6.2. Assurances of confidentiality
Confidentiality was protected by a number of methods. First, no individual household or
member was identified by name in any report or publication about this study. Specific
information learned about a household was not shared with others outside the research team.
Data-handling procedures were developed to safeguard completed data sets. Each household
was assigned a unique identification code, which was used to link household records across
modules and survey rounds. We needed an identifier because this design is a partially
longitudinal study and the households were contacted at baseline, in the one-year follow-up,
and at endline. Data was always be saved in secure systems.
AIR received anonymised survey data from data-collection firms. The de-identified files were
used for all analyses. AIR had no way of identifying survey participants. Data was analysed
collectively so that information from any one household or participant would remain
anonymous. We also ensured that study staff members were trained to understand ethical
research.
Upon receipt of qualitative data, AIR researchers immediately processed the data to remove
any identifiable information from transcripts. De-identified qualitative data was used for all
analysis and report writing purposes. Original transcripts are kept by the principal
investigator and are accessible only to her.
4.6.3. Identifying, managing, and reporting adverse events
While it was unlikely there will be adverse events attributable to the study, we knew it was
possible youth or adult participants could experience psychological discomfort from an
interview. Therefore, we were prepared to report any unanticipated problems involving risks
to participants or others, serious or continuing noncompliance, or any other incident that is
reportable to IRB per protocol or per IRB to the data-collection supervisor, the principal
investigator, and the AIR IRB. The supervisor and principal investigator were instructed to
consider available resources and develop a plan to best meet the needs of the respondents.
All participants were supported to make an informed decision regarding their participation.
Participants were consistently reminded throughout the study that their participation remained
voluntary and that they could choose to decline to answer some or all of the questions,
without any negative repercussion.
4.6.4. COVID-19 mitigation plan
As part of our ongoing research work, AIR has prepared a mitigation strategy related to data
collection during the global COVID-19 pandemic to minimise risks for participants, staff, and
partners in the field. The strategy enabled us to swiftly adapt research design, data collection
instruments, and strategies to respond to the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic in
Madagascar at the time of data collection. While the AIR team was unable to travel to
Madagascar for data collection training, we participated via virtual meeting software (Zoom
and Microsoft Teams). In addition, we ensured that CAETIC and ATW observed social-
distancing measures; and facilitated the provision of preventive measures for staff, such as
masks and hand sanitising. Last, we closely collaborated with CAETIC and ATW, our in-
country data collection partners for this study. These collaborations allowed for local
presence and knowledge, and for continued data collection even though intercontinental
travel remained restricted. Being prepared for these situations enabled us to minimise the risk
of COVID-19 transmission while we conducted our research activities without delay.
37 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection Component
in Madagascar
Additionally, this preparation gave us the opportunity to design context-suitable research
instruments and to reduce possible biases in responses and response rates in instances in
which data could be collected in person.
4.6.5. Respect for beliefs, human rights, gender equity, and the ‘do no harm’
principle
To ensure respect for UNEG principles, AIR led trainings with data collectors which were
held for approximately a week. Sessions were conducted by AIR with CAETIC (for
quantitative training) and ATW (for qualitative training) to ensure standardised, accurate,
sensitive, and safe interviewing techniques with the interviewers. The training sessions
covered the following topics: (a) background on the purpose of the study and on data
collection and design; (b) a participatory review of the questionnaire/protocol and practice
interview techniques in class, including role playing; (c) the procedures for and importance of
maintaining confidentiality; (d) sensitivity toward study subjects; (e) protecting the privacy of
the participants; (f) identification and response to adverse effects; (g) interviewer safety; and
(h) human subjects research protection.
5. Description of beneficiary households
In this section, we describe the LUL-eligible beneficiary population in terms of the
characteristics that the LUL transfer does not affect. These characteristics include household
demographics and adults’ education level. We summarize these dimensions separately from
the impact evaluation component because they should not change as a result of the
programme. However, these outcomes are important moderators for the LUL programme.
Throughout this section, we focus on different collections of respondents, depending on the
nature of the outcome. Table G.1 summarizes the number of households in the control group,
the Transferts Monétaires pour les Droits Humains (TMDH; Monetary Transfer for Human
Development) group and the LUL group. The table also breaks the LUL group (n=771) down
into those who enrolled in the programme (n=543) and those who lived in LUL communes
and were eligible for the programme but did not enrol to receive the transfer (n=228).
5.1. Household composition
LUL-eligible households in our sample are generally large households with multiple young
household members. There is a large range of household sizes, with most households
consisting of 4–10 members (see Figure F.1). The average household size is 7.4 members,
which is larger than the national average (4.9 members). To be included in the programme,
LUL-eligible households must have one head, one child aged 10 years or younger to qualify
for TMDH, and one child aged 11–18 years who can enrol in the final year of primary school
or in secondary school to qualify for LUL. Table G.2 shows that households average
1.2 children aged 5–10 years and 2.5 children aged 11–18 years. The population of our study
is largely shaped by the programme eligibility. The two main subgroups of our study are the
eligible children and their parents. Figure F.2 shows a large mass of individuals under the age
of 20 years who make up the children eligible for the transfer and their siblings. We also see
a slight bulge among adults in their late 30s to early 50s, corresponding to the parents of these
children. Given the sampling strategy of LUL-eligible households, we see relatively few
individuals in their late 20s and early 30s because they are too old to enrol in LUL and too
young to have LUL-eligible children. We also see few elderly household members, who are
38 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection Component
in Madagascar
too old to be parents of LUL-eligible children. We found that households in LUL communes
are roughly balanced between males and females (49.7 per cent female).
5.2. Adult education
About the Evaluative ratings
Adults in LUL-eligible households have completed As part of our evaluation, we assigned an
evaluative rating to each evaluation criterion:
relatively little schooling. These adults generally

• A red evaluative rating indicates that

per cent completed four years or fewer of school, and
less than one in four adults attended school beyond the five years of primary school. These
numbers are lower than the national primary school completion rate, which was 31.57 per
cent when last recorded in 2018 (UNESCO, 2018). There were 2,678 adults over 18 years of
age in total in our sample, with females comprising 48.9 per cent of the adult sample.
Females completed slightly less school than their male counterparts, with 16.3 per cent never
completing any school and 64.2 per cent completing less than a primary education. There is a
strong relationship between an individual’s age and the likelihood of having enrolled in
school. Figure F.4 shows that about 96 per cent of young adults (aged 19–29) and 85 per cent
of adults aged 30–64 had ever enrolled in school. Only 71 per cent of older adults (aged 65
and above) had ever enrolled in school.
6. Evaluation findings
In this section, we describe the findings from the LUL impact and process evaluations. We
present findings that answer each evaluation question (as presented in the terms of reference)
and we have organized the evaluation questions in accordance with the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development’s Development Assistance Committee criteria. We
also present evaluative ratings for each evaluation criterion, as described in the textbox on the
right.

all of the education expenses.

in Madagascar
school expenses due to poverty. As discussed in more detail under Evaluation Question 5, the
programme followed comprehensive targeting criteria to identify the most vulnerable
households to benefit from the cash transfer. A district education official described the dire
situation faced by parents from vulnerable households: “When the parents don’t have money,
they don’t send their children to school because they don’t even have food.” In addition,
parents often had many children and were unable to send all of those children to school. A
beneficiary explained that parents often had to be selective with schooling when they had a
large family: “In our case, we are many siblings, and our parents cannot afford to send us all
to school, so my elders had to drop out.” Other children and parents who benefited from LUL
offered similar accounts of pulling older children out of school.
Respondents explained that older children often dropped out of school to work and help their
parents earn money. Dropout is common among children ages 6–18 years, with roughly 10–
20 per cent of children ages 6–18 who enroll in school later dropping out. Figure F.5 shows
the share of children in each district who have dropped out. Of note, many of the children still
enrolled in school will drop out in the future, so this number will increase in years to come.
Both girls and boys participated in income-generating activities, while girls also tended to get
married. Children often participated in agricultural work to provide for their families, and a
few respondents mentioned that children worked in the gold mines. Beneficiary children and
parents confirmed instances of older children dropping out of school to work. Even when
children did not drop out of school to work, a few teachers mentioned that students missed
class during the planting and harvest seasons, which interrupted their education.
While less common, a few respondents recognized non-financial barriers to accessing
education, including difficulty passing the Certificat d’Études Primaires Élémentaires (CEPE)
exam and a lack of parental support for education. Several teachers and parents of
beneficiaries told stories of students dropping out of school after failing to pass their CEPE
exam. A parent explained that her son’s discouragement caused him to give up on his
education: “He sat for the CEPE exam, but failed. And he said he wanted to stop and go to
work. So, he is farming, now.” A respondent from FID mentioned that parents tended to
undervalue education in the countryside and were less willing to send their children to
secondary school. Stakeholders noted that a lack of confidence in the school system also
contributed to limited parental support for education.
Evaluation Question 2: How adequate have the size (value) and regularity of the scholarship
been to achieve the scholarship programme objectives?
The LUL bi-monthly transfer appears to have been too small to induce the kind of
widespread change envisioned when the programme was designed. While large enough to
attain some level of impact for the core goal of increasing enrolment (see Impact section), the
impacts could have been larger and could have extended to a wider range of domains. Figure
F.6 shows that the majority of households reported that a hypothetical 10,000 AR per child
(whether they had already received the LUL transfer or not) was not enough to enrol their
children in school. This view was reported relatively consistently across the three groups in
the study, with about 30–40 per cent of households in control, TMDH and LUL communes
all reporting that the amount was too small. A hypothetical 10,000 AR per child corresponds
to the actual impacts that we present in Section 6.4 because we test for the marginal impact of
the LUL transfer. In other words, we do not consider the total value provided to the
household by TMDH-LUL since both TMDH and LUL households will receive the basic

- Parent costs, the impact of the LUL transfer will be limited.
Evaluation Question 3: Has the allocated funding reflected the level of needs of scholarship
recipients and the operating needs?
Respondents felt that the cash transfer did make a difference in helping families send their
children to school, though they agreed that they still had outstanding education costs
associated with children’s schooling.5 While many of the households could have paid for
school expenses without the LUL transfer, some needed the cash to pay for expenses they
could not have otherwise afforded. Interviewees explained that parents covered numerous
expenses related to education, spending the largest amounts on buying stationary, food and
uniforms; supplementing teachers’ salaries; and contributing to school upkeep. Given all of
these costs, parents felt that the transfer amount made a small contribution to their spending
needs. In addition to the expenses detailed above, some parents noted that they had paid
registration fees during the most recent school year, even though most respondents explained
that these fees had been waived.
Parents reported that they struggled to pay various
operational school costs, including teacher salaries and “20,000 Ariary is not enough to
school maintenance costs. A parent explained that the cover the children’s schooling and
community was often responsible for paying fees to stationeries. It is just enough for the
keep schools running, as well as the salaries of school uniform.” - Parent
additional teachers who were not paid by the
government: “Besides, they don’t have enough teachers in government schools, and the
parents are charged with hiring community teachers … So, the little help that we get, we also
have to share it with the community teachers.” Parents described paying between 7,000 and
10,000 Ariary and 100 to 200 cups of rice to cover teacher renumeration. Stakeholders
explained that parents also covered gaps in government allocations to maintain school
premises. A district education official explained:
For example, there is no desk, the cash in hand of the mayor is not enough to pay [for]
desks for each establishment within the Commune he is in charge of; it must be the
parents in the area who are going to think about it, and there must be an amount to be
paid. That’s why I say that education at 0 ariary doesn’t exist; there must be an
amount to be paid.
Several parents confirmed that they were required to make payments for school tables and
benches through the parent–teacher association.
5 The LUL cash transfer was not intended to cover all costs associated with education but instead contribute to the expenses
parents must incur to send their children to school.
41 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection Component
in Madagascar
Evaluation Question 4: How relevant is the LUL cash component to meet government needs
and priorities?*
Respondents believe that the LUL cash transfer programme supports the government of
Madagascar’s education priorities, specifically in terms of preventing student dropout and
retaining students in secondary school amongst the 39,000 households the programme aimed
to serve. A district education official discussed the programme’s support for secondary
education: “It really helps the poorest households who have children attending the secondary
schools.” The government’s education commitments are outlined in policy documents
including the National Development Plan and the National Education Sector Plan (PSE)
2018–2022, among others. A respondent from UNICEF noted LUL’s alignment with the
National Development Plan, which focuses on poverty alleviation by increasing access to
social services including education. The PSE aims to improve access to secondary education,
with an emphasis on creating a system of scholarships that favours poor and female students
(Ministry of National Education, Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research,
Ministry of Employment and Technical and Vocational Education, 2017, p. 20). Stakeholders
also discussed LUL’s alignment with the social protection policy, which is discussed in more
detail under Evaluation Question 7.
Evaluation Question 5: To what extent have equity, gender equality, and human rights goals
and processes been incorporated into the planning of the scholarship programme?
Respondents agreed that the LUL programme was
designed to incorporate principles such as equity, “The programme is focusing on
gender equality and human rights. The programme human rights because it is

makes it possible to target the most vulnerable
populations” (UNICEF Madagascar, 2016).
Respondents described the targeting approach, explaining that it incorporated both a review
of household assets and community validation to confirm that identified households were
truly vulnerable.
Stakeholders explained that gender equality was integrated into the programme by providing
the cash transfer to women. The LUL 2016 Programme Document noted that paying the
transfer directly to women encouraged empowerment and positive coping mechanisms
(UNICEF Madagascar, 2016). A respondent from FID added that programme indicators
included a focus on women-headed households. Beyond this, the programme was designed to
target girls and boys equally. This is discussed in more detail under Evaluation Question 6.
Stakeholders believe that the LUL programme is guided by human rights goals, such as
ensuring a child’s right to education. In its Human Rights-Based Approach to Education for
All Framework, UNICEF asserts that “the duty is to encourage [secondary education]
42 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection Component
in Madagascar
development and make it available and accessible to every child, and free where possible”
(UNICEF/UNESCO, 2007, p. 30). This aligns closely with LUL’s explicit goal of increasing
enrolment and attendance in secondary school specifically.
Evaluation Question 6: Has the scholarship been designed to provide for equal participation
by all relevant groups (i.e., girls and boys)?
Respondents believe that the programme is designed to reach different vulnerable groups
equally. Specifically, stakeholders reported that the programme targeted both girls and boys,
without prioritizing one group over another. The LUL 2016 Programme Document explains
the rationale behind this approach: “It was decided not to favour girls over boys because the
net enrolment rates did not show any differences between the sexes” (UNICEF/UNESCO,
2007, p. 30). A respondent from FID elaborated on this point: “There was no discrimination
against girls, all households were treated equally. LUL is given to two children in a
household; whether the household has a girl and a boy or two girls makes no difference.”
Teachers and principals validated LUL’s approach, mentioning that they were not aware of
major differences in attendance or enrolment between girls and boys; adolescents of both
genders are at risk of dropping out of school due to financial barriers and often leave school
to work and support their family. While the programme did not prioritize one group over
another, 12,703 girls and 11,508 boys participated in the programme, demonstrating that the
LUL cash transfer reached more girls than boys (UNICEF Madagascar, 2021).
Evaluation Question 7: To what extent was the programme aligned to policies and strategies
in Madagascar, and how relevant is the programme to implement the social protection policy in
Madagascar?*
Findings from the desk review and qualitative data suggest that LUL supports the
implementation of Madagascar’s national social protection policy. One of the goals of the
national social protection policy is to improve access to education. The policy document
notes that different mechanisms support the realization of this goal, including conditional
cash transfers and social safety nets (Ministry of the Population, of Social Protection, and of
the Promotion of the Woman, 2015). As a conditional cash transfer benefiting the most
vulnerable households, LUL directly supports access to education in line with the goals of the
policy. A respondent from FID explained:
We are all aware that LUL programme is providing scholarship for households, this is
significantly contributing to social protection because (…) those households are
among the most disadvantaged. As a result, this programme is joining the social
protection programme of the government.
Respondents from MPPSPF agreed that LUL advances the objectives of the national social
protection policy. Notably, the addition of the LUL cash transfer to TMDH increased the
coverage of the programme, providing financial support to access education to more children
than before. This is key to the national social protection policy, as it underscores the need for
increased access to education, especially for children. LUL’s alignment with other policies in
Madagascar is discussed under Evaluation Question 4.

Evaluation Question 8: What barriers have potentially LUL-eligible households with out-of-
school children faced in enrolling children in school?
Similar to beneficiaries, non-beneficiaries explained that they struggled to enrol their children
in school due to financial barriers. According to discussions with parents and children, most
children had been enrolled in school at some point but dropped out due to the inability to
cover costs associated with education (including school fees and supplements for teacher
salaries). A non-beneficiary parent recounted having to pull her child out of school: “The first
boy who is 14 used to be at school, but due to our problems in life, he couldn’t continue
because we can’t afford paying school.” Another parent explained that her child dropped out
of school because of the high fees for teacher salaries: “But we had to pay our contribution
per child in PTA which was meant for the payment of non-civil servant teachers [volunteer
teachers]. That was very heavy for us.” Other non-beneficiaries experienced similar
challenges covering education expenses.

entitled. At the time of endline data collection,
only 8 per cent of beneficiaries (44 in total) were still waiting on LUL funds. The largest
proportion of beneficiaries with outstanding payments lived in Betioky Atsimo (18.6 per
cent) followed by Vohipeno (11.6 per cent), Ambohimahasoa (9.9 per cent), Mahanoro (3.8
per cent) and Faratsiho (1.1 per cent). These findings align with data collected from
beneficiaries during qualitative focus group discussions. (For detailed evaluation findings
related to payment delivery, please see Evaluation Question 9.) We also found that
households enrolled in the LUL programme (not just our sample) received a total average
transfer of 56,000 AR, of which the LUL supplement made up just over 15,000 AR per
household. The total transfer comprises more than just the LUL transfer—the general transfer
and the transfers for younger children enrolled in school made up roughly 41,000 AR per
household. With a 10,000 AR LUL payment per eligible child, plus the bonus amount
available for students in the 7ème and 3ème grades, an average of approximately 15,000 AR
per household for LUL is reasonable.
Understandably, the COVID-19 pandemic led to other deviations from the LUL cash transfer
programme design. For example, the attendance requirement was waived during the
pandemic and community for development (C4D) activities were suspended temporarily.
44 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection Component
in Madagascar
However, a few respondents (in particular, teachers) reported that when the attendance
requirement was active, attendance data were not always used to determine payments,
compromising the conditionality of the cash transfer. A teacher from Ambodiharina reported,
“[Beneficiaries] are always benefiting because [attendance] reports are not received
regularly.” It is not clear how widespread this perception is (of attendance reports being
delayed or not fully considered by FID), but numerous teachers mentioned that beneficiary
lists were not being consistently updated and referenced the challenge of producing
attendance reports in the format required by LUL. Regarding updates to beneficiary lists,
several teachers and education officials mentioned that households with children who had
dropped out of school or died continued to receive the cash transfer.
Lastly, case management services do not appear to have consistently functioned as intended.
According to programme technical reports, FID’s operational team is responsible for
managing complaints about project activities (UNICEF Madagascar, 2021, Section 5.1) and
FID maintains that complaints with required support documentation are resolved in a timely
manner to respect the rights of beneficiaries. However, beneficiaries from Betsizaraina and
Mahanaro, in particular, reported a lack of follow-up on their registered complaints. One
beneficiary from Betsizaraina said, “We lodged a claim when we had that problem [not
receiving the correct amount], but as [our contact from FID] no longer worked for them, we
don’t know where our claim went.” According to another beneficiary, four mothers from
Betsizaraina reported incorrect payment amounts but were still waiting for resolution at the
time of data collection. Other beneficiaries also reported that their phone calls were not
answered or returned.
While the technical reports state that the FID
operational team is responsible for managing “We did not get the payment, so,
complaints, mother leaders also appear to be we called them, but they did not

from Camp Robin told the research team, “For
example, if there are complaints from the recipients,
we receive it first and then transmit it to the FID, or to the CPS which transmit it itself to the
FID.” Beneficiaries from Mahanoro confirmed that mother leaders listened to their
grievances but indicated that there had been no resolution to their complaints yet.
Finally, while certainly not the fault of the LUL cash transfer programme, it is worth noting
that a number of beneficiaries shared their reluctance to file complaints in the first place. One
beneficiary from Manandroy explained, “We’ll eventually receive the full amount, anyway.
So why complain?” Other beneficiaries, including this beneficiary from Ambatosoa, noted
that they were afraid to complain: “There won’t be people that will dare complain.” Lastly,
some beneficiaries mentioned that it is not their custom in rural areas to question or complain.
For example, a parent from Mahanoro did not receive the full payment and was told their
child had skipped school. Even though they did not believe this to be the case, they did not
press the issue: “You see, we, in the countryside, we are afraid of something like that, when
we are told to do something, we obey.” Thus, in addition to the case management system not
functioning consistently, some LUL transfer beneficiaries were reluctant to lodge complaints.

Programme take-up
The LUL transfer’s take-up rate increased among eligible households from 62.5 per cent at
midline to 71.9 per cent at endline, according to respondents’ self-reporting. In Figure F.7,
we see that the district of Mahanoro had the lowest self-reported take-up rate of 60.2 per cent
at endline, while the district of Ambohimahasoa had the highest self-reported take-up rate of
85.1 per cent. With the exception of Faratsiho, district level self-reported take-up rates tend to
be higher than the take-up rates reported in the program’s administrative data. This is
particularly noticeable in Toamasina II where the self-reported take-up rate is almost twice as
large as the administrative data. This mismatch may be due to fact that some households that
have dropped out of the programme reported that they were still receiving transfers or to
inaccuracies in the administrative data itself. As shown in Figure F.8, none of the TMDH-
only households and only a few control households received the LUL transfer, which
indicates that there was little to no contamination between the LUL, TMDH-only and control
groups. The proportion of control households that received the transfer is low at 3.8 per cent
and is likely due to households moving from a LUL-eligible district to a non-eligible one.
Most households in LUL communes were aware of cash transfer programmes taking place in
their communities. As shown in Figure F.9, 95 per cent of households in LUL communes
knew that cash transfer programmes were available in their community, and 90 per cent of
households were aware of the LUL programme specifically. Awareness of cash transfers was
high in TMDH communes (89 per cent) but fewer households in TMDH communes were
familiar with the LUL programme specifically (57 per cent). In contrast, less than half of the
households in control communes had heard of cash transfer programmes.
While most LUL recipients understood the programme’s enrolment conditions, a large
minority of households in eligible communes did not know about the programme. As
illustrated in Figure F.11, 96 per cent of LUL households who received the LUL transfer
believed that the programme’s enrolment criteria were clear. However, a minority of LUL-
eligible households were not aware of the programme’s existence, which appears to have
substantially driven down LUL uptake. Figure F.10 shows that 36 per cent of LUL-eligible
households who did not enrol in the programme had never heard of LUL, while 12 per cent
knew of the programme but did not know that they were eligible to receive the transfer.
Lastly, roughly one in four households reported that they did not enrol in LUL because they
did not have a child in the eligible grade levels. For those with children aged 11–18, they may
not have known that they would become eligible upon enrolling their child in school.
A majority of households had to travel for over an hour to receive their LUL transfer, but the
long travel distance was not perceived as a risk by LUL recipients. As shown in Figure F.14,
close to half of LUL households reported travelling for more than an hour to reach their
payment location. However, only 5.1 per cent of households reported having problems or
needing to take a risk to receive their transfer.

case reported a delay receiving funds from
UNICEF. However, a few respondents noted administrative challenges on FID’s
reconciliation of payments which caused delays in the disbursement of subsequent transfers.
For instance, UNICEF respondents noted that payment delays were due to “administrative
problems, management of funds and liquidation” on the part of FID, while one informant
from FID stated, “UNICEF procedure is very heavy (…) if we have to repatriate the money
then ask it back again.” Importantly, however, beneficiaries reported during focus groups
that while they sometimes went as long as four to six months without receiving a payment,
most beneficiary households ultimately received their full payment amount. Quantitative
survey results corroborate this finding, with only 8 per cent of households still awaiting
payment at the time of data collection (see Figure F.12).
Receipt of correct amount
We found that a large majority of households on the LUL registry received the correct
amount, as defined by programme records. However, we were only able to detect the extent
to which actual payments matched the payments calculated from administrative data. If the
administrative data are incorrect, the calculated payment will also be incorrect. For the LUL
payment preceding endline survey administration, only 7.7 per cent of LUL beneficiaries
(n=7,729) received a correction payment to adjust for previous errors. This rate indicates that
beneficiaries generally received the amount that FID administrative data determined they
should receive. However, this does not account for errors in the administrative data that result
in the planned payment amount being incorrect. For example, the administrative data may
incorrectly record a child as being out of school and hence ineligible.
47 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection Component
in Madagascar
Evaluation Question 11: How timely and effectively has the scholarship delivery process
been managed?
As discussed in detail under evaluation question 9, most households (61 per cent) reported
experiencing delays receiving payments. However, nearly all households (92 per cent)
reported ultimately receiving the full amount to which they were entitled. So, while we
cannot say that the payment process was consistently timely, it was largely effective in
(eventually) delivering the correct sum of money to beneficiaries. Further, the fact that the
LUL cash transfer is a supplement to TMDH may have incurred in cost and time savings in
comparison to a standalone programme.
As for case management, as discussed in detail under evaluation question 8, beneficiaries
reported mixed experiences with case management services. Several focus group participants
reported that their complaints had not been responded to or resolved as of the time of data
collection, so we cannot say that the case management services have operated entirely
efficiently or as intended. Survey data also indicate that awareness and use of case
management services were low among LUL beneficiaries. Despite recurring payment delays,
only 5.1 per cent of LUL households—28 in total—reported experiencing other payment
problems or taking risks in order to receive their transfer. Among households that
experienced payment problems, only a third knew to contact FID payment personnel, and
even fewer (28.6 per cent) contacted FID regarding their payment issues (see Figure F.13).
Moreover, less than half (42.9 per cent) of households that used case management services
saw their problem eventually resolved.
In considering the overall efficiency of the programme, it is worth noting that one quarter of
TMDH-LUL transfer beneficiaries reported travelling an hour or more to receive their
transfer (see Figure F.14). Significant travel time could potentially reduce uptake among
households who cannot or will not travel to the pay point. The survey question, as posed to
respondents, should only capture the time taken to travel to the distribution point. However,
some of the longer travel times may have been reported by respondents who provided the
total travel time (i.e., a round trip).
Evaluation Question 12: Were capabilities built or in place to ensure implementation?*
The conditionality of the LUL cash transfer supplement—and the heavy administrative
burden associated with maintaining the conditionality—continued to present challenges for
programme implementation at the time of endline data collection. A respondent from
UNICEF suggested that the programme should be simplified to prevent the types of recurring
delays that have plagued the programme thus far:
We have the conditionalities linked to each child, we have conditionalities to follow,
we have a database to update every school year which makes it really difficult, and
that is, we are always late, we are never regular. So, for me, it’s simple, we really
have to simplify our job because we are in a country which has very low
administrative capacity and we cannot make such a difficult programme.
Other respondents noted the need for more capacity-building related to taking attendance and
using attendance information. According to one local education official (chef de zone
d’administration pédagogique—ZAP), “The school directors responsible for the attendance
record should get some training.” Teachers noted the difficulty of taking attendance in the

required format, and one teacher from Betsizaraina expressed a desire to be compensated for
the extra effort:
I have been among the teachers to fill in the forms since our school receives the LUL.
It’s very difficult to fill in the forms, and also for the colleagues because there is one
responsible teacher per level to do it and to monitor the children. There is nothing to
motivate us, so we ask the partners to think thereof.

for serving in that role.

increased from 76.5 per cent at baseline to 82.3 per

respectively. These results are particularly encouraging considering that the net enrolment
rate for primary and secondary school in Madagascar was 61.2 per cent when last reported in
2019 (UNESCO Institute for Statistics, 2021). Enrolment at endline was slightly higher
among girls than boys, at 85.4 per cent and 83.9 per cent respectively (see Figure F.15).
Across LUL districts, enrolment was lowest in Faratsiho, at 76.9 per cent, and highest in
Toamasina II, at 88 per cent (see Figure F.16). The total rate of primary school enrolment in
Madagascar in 2012-2013 was 69.4% whereas the government target is 90% (see Annex I).
49 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection Component
in Madagascar
While our sample’s estimate is well above the national average and close to the government
target, it is important to note that our sample is representative not of overall enrolment but
inststead for just those children eligible for LUL.
This is supported by the qualitative findings on enrolment. Many stakeholders—primarily
teachers and education officials—noted that school enrolment rates had increased since the
LUL programme started. For example, a school principal from Camp Robin explained that
enrolment rates had increased regularly during the LUL programme period. Similarly, a
district education official from Ambohimahasoa stated that he had observed enrolment
increases due to the LUL programme because the cash transfer was an important incentive for
parents: “There was an increase [in enrolment], because of this programme. It really is a big
incentive for parents. And the teachers even told me that this programme should be
continued, because at this rate, we may achieve to drastically reduce the dropout rate.”
However, respondents from some programme areas (notably Camp Robin, Betsizaraina and
Ambatosoa) believe that increased enrolment may also be related to the fact that the
government waived school registration fees. For instance, the chief ZAP from Camp Robin
explained, “There is a positive change regarding the number of enrolled children attending
school. This is due to the free-of-charge enrolment.” A teacher from Ambatosoa reported a
similar situation: “[Enrolments] have increased so much since the launching of the
programme, and this time it was even more so with the fact that the registration and the
school fees are now free so it increases.”
Generally, respondents stated that there was no difference in enrolment between girls and
boys.
Attendance
Like enrolment, child attendance was high overall and slightly higher for girls. At the time of
data collection, 93.6 per cent of girls and 92.6 per cent of boys had attended every day of
school in the previous month. Attendance rates were consistent across the 11ème to 1ère
grades (over 90 per cent) but were lower in the maternelle and terminale grades (88.4 per cent
and 81.3 per cent, respectively) (see Figure F.19). Across districts, attendance was highest in
Mahanoro, at 95.8 per cent, and lowest in Betioky Atsimo, at 87.2 per cent (see Figure F.18).
These attendance rates are high, so it is likely that the programme faced ceiling effects and
could only improve attendance by a small amount. It should also be noted that enrolment,
attendance and grade progression outcomes were self-reported. These results are therefore
subject to recall bias (i.e., forgetting the true value) and social desirability bias (i.e., providing
answers the respondent thinks the enumerator wants to hear).
These high reported rates of attendance align with data from qualitative interviews. The
majority of stakeholders—including education officials, teachers and directors—reported that
attendance rates were high and believe that the LUL cash transfer helped to improve student
attendance. The most cited reason for this belief was that parents were motivated to send their
children to school because they were afraid to lose the cash transfer support. For example, a
teacher from Camp Robin explained:

students to attend school. Perceptions of gender
differences in school attendance were mixed. A few respondents noted that girls had better
attendance records, while others stated that there were no differences in attendance by
gender.
Dropout
We found differences in enrolment and dropout rates between children in various age cohorts,
which suggests that LUL may be supporting certain children’s academic progress more than
others based on their age and grade. As shown in Figures F.20-F.25, enrolment was highest in
the 7- to 13-year-old age range (i.e., children of primary school age and children who were
beginning secondary school). However, enrolment rates continuously declined among
children aged 12 and older and reached their lowest among 18-year-olds. This decrease was
noticeable among both girls and boys (see Figure F.22). Additionally, a quarter of children
aged 15–18 had dropped out of school, compared with 10.1 per cent among 6- to 10-year-
olds and 5.7 per cent among 11- to 14-year-olds (see Figure F.23).
There was general agreement among qualitative respondents that the LUL programme had
reduced school dropout. Most stakeholders reported that fewer children were abandoning
school since the LUL programme began. Similar to perspectives about attendance, the main
reason cited for this reduced dropout rate was parents’ motivation to meet LUL attendance
criteria in order to continue receiving the cash transfer. For example, a district education
official from Ambohimahasoa noted:
Thanks to the LUL programme, more children are going to school. And if this goes
on, I think we can achieve the zero dropout. The parents are now aware of the
importance of schooling, and they also want to get the financial support. So, they send
them, because they get multiple benefits.
Once again, there were mixed opinions on differences in dropout by gender. Several
respondents reported that there was no difference between girls and boys in dropout rates,
while others mentioned that girls may drop out more because of marriage.
51 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection Component
in Madagascar
Grade progression
While roughly 80 per cent of children enrol in primary school by 7 years of age, progression
through subsequent grades slows, with a quick drop-off in the share of children who remain
on track to complete one grade per year. Figure F.25 shows the percentage of children who
enrolled in primary school (11ème) and progressed one grade per year. Roughly three out of
four children had fallen behind this pace by the age of 11, when they should be entering
secondary school (6ème). This finding suggests that many children face educational
challenges prior to being eligible for the LUL transfer.
Grade progression over the previous year among LUL-eligible children was high and
consistent across LUL districts. We found that 89.1 per cent of children had progressed to the
next grade between the 2019–2020 and 2020–2021 school years. The progress rate was
lowest in Vohipeno, at 85.3 per cent, and highest in Toamasina II, at 92.2 per cent (see
Figure F.27). Differences in grade progression rates by sex were negligible: 89.6 per cent for
girls, compared with 88.5 per cent for boys (see Figure F.26). However, grade progression
rates were particularly low in the 3ème grade (60.9 per cent) and the terminale grade (28.6
per cent) (see Figure F.28). In Madagascar, 3ème and terminale are the last grades in lower
and upper secondary school, respectively. Students in these grades must take national exams
in order to progress to the next phase of their education. These exams—the Brevet d’Études
du Premier Cycle de l’Enseignement Secondaire (BEPC) in 3ème and the Baccalaureate in
Terminale—create an additional obstacle for students and may explain why grade
progression rates are lowest in those grades. Although most students progressed to the next
grade over the previous year, losing 10 per cent of students per year still results in a large
number who fall behind over the course of several years.
National exams drove down grade progression, likely due to students failing to pass the test.
For example, as illustrated in Figure F.28, only 61 per cent of children who enrolled in the
3ème grade during 2019–2020 progressed to the 2nde grade in 2020–2021.
These results are consistent with data from interviews with programme stakeholders, as well
as focus groups with parents. Teachers and education officials noted that grade progression
has improved since the LUL programme started, largely due to increased attendance, which
they believe has improved student performance. Many beneficiary parents also reported that
their LUL beneficiary children were able to progress at a satisfactory rate. However, some
parents reported that their children had repeated their grade. In alignment with the findings on
lower progression rates in the 3ème grade, a few parents noted that their children had failed
the BEPC exam and had repeated their grade several times.

spending (tuition, fees and supplies), there were no spending impacts attributable to LUL.
Household education expenditures remained relatively constant across household size. Figure
F.29 shows that spending per child was roughly US$8, regardless of household size. This
finding is important because the LUL transfer is capped per household, which means that
households could have more eligible children in need but would receive the same level of
support.
The LUL transfer design aims to cover the costs of schooling, both direct and indirect. Table
G.3 shows the impacts of the transfer on some of the direct costs of schooling. In this table
and the impact tables that follow, we present the impact estimate for LUL in the far-left
column of numbers and the impact of TMDH on LUL beneficiaries immediately to the right.
From left to right, we present the means and sample sizes for LUL, TMDH and control
households. We did not detect statistically significant impacts for any of the three main
categories of direct school costs. Had the direct cost of schooling functioned as the main
impediment to children’s school enrolment, we would expect to see significant, positive
impacts. However, given that a majority of households reported that the transfer was too
small (see Figure F.6), it could also be the case that the transfer did not cover the direct costs.
Furthermore, there are many indirect costs of education that may contribute to children not
enrolling in school. Although we did not detect any meaningful impacts on consumption,
these tests were at the household level. If we had the data to test child-level consumption, we
could find impacts at that localized level.
Qualitative findings suggest that LUL beneficiaries spent the cash transfer primarily on their
children’s education, although these expenses may include indirect costs such as food, school
uniforms and other clothing items, additional school fees beyond school registration (such as
payment of teachers’ salaries), and rent for those students whose homes were too distant from
school to otherwise attend (for example, some respondents from Mahanoro had children who
lived away from home to attend school). A few parents reported that they used LUL money
to buy livestock such as chickens, in order to eventually sell chicks or eggs to help with their
children’s education expenses. As a parent from Camp Robin noted, “For me, when we get
the money we buy chicken. And it is with these hens that we help the children.” Although
respondents generally agreed that the LUL cash transfer was not enough to cover education
expenses (as discussed in detail in Evaluation Question 3), several respondents stated that
they felt relieved to receive the cash transfer, and that it made a difference to their ability to
cover school expenses. Another respondent from Camp Robin noted, “For me, the existence
of the LUL grant made me feel relieved about the school fees and school supplies.” A
respondent from Ambatosoa expressed a similar opinion:
As for me, school expenses are heavy. We cannot say that the money they give is
sufficient but it depends on the parents. For instance, I receive the 20,000 Ariary from
LUL, I will give a part of that the teacher, and still there are materials to buy to do
things well. So, I cannot wait for the next LUL distribution date and have to sell one
chicken for example. Once I get the money, I buy a new one and that’s how it works.
Same for the rice, grow and sell. So I wonder, maybe we can say it is not enough but
anyway it helps parents a lot. So we thank the people who brought it here.
Consumption
Despite detecting some small, positive impacts on three categories of food consumption, the
overall impact of the transfer on household consumption was limited. Overall, the transfer did
not have any statistically significant impacts on the consumption of either food or non-food
53 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection Component
in Madagascar
items. When we focused exclusively on expenditures on cereals, flour and prepared food, we
did find positive impacts on per-capita expenditures. However, those positive impact
estimates largely offset negative impact estimates seen for the TMDH transfer. It is unlikely
that TMDH actually reduced food consumption; rather, it is likely that the random
assignment of communes to the treatment arm resulted in a TMDH group with unusually low
consumption by chance. That would mean that the TMDH group shows consumption lower
than the control group and the LUL remains in line with the control group. On net, the LUL
group consumption is largely similar to the control group consumption. Furthermore, the
impacts only represented a change of about 2 per cent in total consumption.
The LUL transfer was primarily intended to cover the direct costs of education and offset lost
wages from child labour, so it is unsurprising that there were limited impacts on broader
consumption.
According to data from focus groups, food was one of the primary items on which
beneficiary parents reported spending the LUL transfer. Food purchased using LUL cash
transfer funds often consisted of snacks to be consumed by children during the school day,
but also included food for the household. This aligns with the finding that LUL caused
households to spend US$0.05 more on prepared foods per week.
Agriculture
Overall, we detected no meaningful impacts on households’ agricultural outcomes. At
baseline, 88.4 per cent of households in LUL communes grew crops. This high percentage
means that ceiling effects likely prevented the transfer from increasing the share of
households who grew crops, as the 11.6 per cent of households who were not growing crops
may have had no land, agriculturally unsuitable land or other limitations preventing them
from growing crops. While Table G.5 shows a 12-percentage-point increase in the likelihood
that LUL households owned any form of livestock, we determined that this impact was likely
spurious given that the LUL mean was lower than the control group. Livestock holding can
benefit individuals through two main channels: first, livestock can improve nutrition by
providing dairy or meat products for consumption; and second, livestock can serve as a store
of wealth. As discussed previously, beneficiaries interviewed in focus groups recounted using
LUL cash transfer money to invest in livestock as a way to save for educational expenses in
the future.
Food security
We found no evidence that the LUL transfer affected households’ food security (see Table
G.6). This result is unsurprising, given that there were no meaningful impacts on food
consumption or agricultural output. While we found no meaningful impacts on food security,
we did detect an 11-percentage-point impact on the number of days that LUL households
went without food during the week prior to data collection.6 However, this estimate has two
limitations. First, the sample is somewhat small, in that it only focuses on the 303 LUL
households who had limited access to food. Second, it was rare that households faced days
without any food. For example, TMDH and control households averaged zero days without
food. This means that even a single household changing their response could affect our
impacts.
6 All impact estimates come from ordinary least squares regressions. In cases such as this, where there are many observations
at the minimum value, results can become unstable. To test whether this case faces such a problem, we ran the model using a
tobit regression and found similar results.
54 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection Component
in Madagascar
Food security plays an important role on the pathway from a cash transfer to children’s
education outcomes. A household that is food secure is less likely to undertake negative
coping strategies, such as removing children from school. However, our findings do not
indicate that the food security pathway had any effect on education outcomes. Nonetheless,
beneficiary focus group participants often mentioned that the LUL transfer enabled them to
provide their children with snacks for the school day. Parents, teachers and education
officials believe that this enhanced access to food and snacks, enabling children to learn and
perform better in school.
Evaluation Question 16: To what extent has the LUL top-up resulted in additional impacts on
student absenteeism, dropout, attendance, retention, and promotion?
Schooling, children aged 11–14
The LUL transfer was effective at improving schooling outcomes among children aged
11–14. Table G.7 shows that there was a 7-percentage-point increase in overall enrolment for
this age group. However, this impact was driven entirely by increased enrolment by girls.
While there was no impact on boys’ enrolment, girls were 13 percentage points more likely to
be enrolled in school than they would have been without the LUL transfer. This finding
shows that the transfer reached some of the more vulnerable members of the target group.
However, the enrolment rate at endline for girls in LUL communes reached 95 per cent.
Combined with a 91 per cent enrolment rate for boys, this means that it is unlikely that
increasing the transfer size would result in a much larger impact, as enrolment would likely
face ceiling effects where the transfer could not induce the remaining children to enrol
in school.
Enrolment rates in our LUL sample fluctuated throughout the course of the study, starting at
94.5 per cent at baseline, dropping to 87 per cent at midline and increasing back up to
93 per cent at endline. The dip at midline was mirrored in the control group, where enrolment
dropped to 71 per cent at midline. However, enrolment in the control group only recovered to
85 per cent at endline. Some of the enrolment effect may have come from preventing children
from leaving school in the first place. The transfer reduced the likelihood that children
dropped out of school by 11 percentage points. It is likely that keeping children in school is
the easiest way to increase enrolment. Children who have dropped out of school face fixed
costs to re-entry, such as lost wages and effort to recover lost learning. Finally, we also found
that the LUL transfer increased attendance. LUL children were 6 percentage points more
likely to have attended school more than 90 per cent of the time. However, more than
95 per cent of children in the control group and TMDH group already attended school 90 per
cent of the time or more, leaving limited room for impacts on attendance.
The LUL transfer appears to have altered students’ progression through school. We found
that LUL caused children’s likelihood of progressing to the next grade to fall by 14
percentage points between 2019–2020 and 2020–2021. One possible explanation is that the
LUL transfer prevented marginally qualified students from dropping out of school, which
lowered average student capability in LUL communes. As described in Evaluation
Question 13, most stakeholders agreed that the LUL programme reduced dropout, with some
indicating that more students were persisting in school after taking the BECP exam—a
previously common point for dropping out of school. Alternatively, COVID-19 school
closures—which were reportedly common (see Figure F.30)—may have suppressed progress
55 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection Component
in Madagascar
in school. However, there is no reason to expect COVID-19 closures to affect LUL children
differently from TMDH or control children.
Labour, children aged 11–14
We found no impacts of the LUL programme on the overall likelihood of employment, but
we did see some changes in the composition of child labour. Table G.8 shows a 9-percentage-
point reduction in the likelihood that boys performed work for pay. The income provided by
the transfer should replace the income provided by working children. We also found an
offsetting increase of 23 percentage points in the likelihood that girls reported performing
domestic work. Changes to domestic work are not as clear to interpret; they conflict with time
a child would otherwise spend in school, but they could also represent children contributing
to overall household wellbeing. More importantly for school enrolment, we found that girls
spent less time working overall. Table G.8 shows that LUL girls worked about 7.8 fewer
hours during the two weeks prior to data collection than a similar TMDH girl. However, it is
important to note that the rate of labour is low across all types of labour. The theory of
change posits that the cash transfer should supplement household income so that children can
stop earning money or providing value through domestic labour and attend school instead. It
appears that this step in the theory of change—in which children are freed up to attend
school—was successful, at least for girls.
Key informants had mixed opinions about how the LUL cash transfer affected child labour.
Some education officials and teachers noted that demand for child labour had decreased since
the LUL transfer started, while others stated that child labour practices remained the same.
Data from focus groups with parents and beneficiary children, however, suggest that LUL
beneficiary children performed a variety of domestic chores at home, with a smaller number
working outside the home for pay. Beneficiary children and their parents reported that
children generally performed various household tasks (fetching water, collecting firewood,
doing dishes, cooking food, washing clothes) and farming activities (crushing rice, collecting
cloves, feeding farm animals, working in the fields), despite going to school. A few
respondents reported that LUL beneficiary children conducted paid work, such as gold
mining and working in farm fields for others.
However, most parents and children noted that this did not interfere with schooling because
children conducted these activities at the weekend, after school and during school breaks. For
example, one parent from Camp Robin noted, “You know, the students only work on fields on
off days, when they don’t have school. Paddy cultivation or cultivation of beans.” One parent
from Betsizaraina noted that her children performed agricultural activities when they were
not at school and believed that this did not affect her children’s schooling: “No. That’s not a
tough job, so it’s not difficult for them.” A minority of parents stated that their children did
not undertake household chores or paid work because they had to study. When asked whether
her children did household chores, a parent from Manandroy noted, “No, they don’t. (…)
They arrive at home at 05:00 PM, and they still need time for their homework.”
Health, children aged 11–14
We found no evidence that the LUL transfer had an impact on 11- to 14-year-old children’s
health and wellbeing (see Table G.9). We did not detect impacts from the transfer on any of
the following outcomes: the likelihood that a child was sick, the likelihood that a sick child
went to a clinic, the likelihood that a child had her or his own blanket, or the likelihood that a
child owned a pair of shoes. There are two main reasons why the transfer may have failed to
56 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection Component
in Madagascar
yield impacts for children’s health. First, children were already generally very healthy, with
only 6 per cent of children reporting that they had been sick during the two months preceding
the survey. This left limited opportunity to change outcomes for sick children. Second, the
design of the transfer targeted children who were likely to need support for their education
and not their health, which means that the targeted population did not necessarily stand to
benefit from improved health outcomes.
Schooling, children aged 15–18
We found similar results for schooling outcomes for older LUL beneficiaries. Table G.10
shows that there was a 9-percentage-point increase in the likelihood that older LUL
beneficiaries would enrol in school. While increased enrolment of children aged 11–14 was
driven by girls, increased enrolment of children aged 15–18 was driven by boys, who were 13
percentage points more likely to enrol in school. This large increase in enrolment is
meaningful, especially for older boys, who have a larger opportunity cost of attending school
given that they can likely attain higher wages and may have longer distances to travel to
school than their younger counterparts since there are fewer upper secondary schools (Lycée)
than lower secondary schools (CEG). Again, this impact may be the result of keeping
children enrolled in school, rather than coaxing out-of-school children to return to school.
(Table G.10 shows the 14-percentage-point reduction in children aged 15–18 dropping out of
school.) As discussed previously, the threshold to induce a child to remain in school is likely
lower than the threshold to encourage a child to return to school.
We also found that older LUL beneficiaries were less likely to progress from one grade to the
next. Children aged 15–18 were 12 percentage points less likely to have progressed grades
during the previous two academic years. This finding mirrors the results for children aged
11–14 and may be driven by a similar dynamic, whereby the LUL transfer kept marginal
students in school, who then struggled to progress from one grade to the next. This aligns
with the previously discussed qualitative findings, which suggest that LUL reduced school
dropout, and that more students are staying in school beyond the BECP exam.
Labour, children aged 15–18
We found that the LUL transfer was effective in reducing child labour for pay and reducing
the total amount of time children spent working. Table G.11 shows a 22-percentage-point
reduction in the likelihood that girls worked for pay. This finding supports the theory of
change’s hypothesis that replacing possible lost income would allow children to remain in
school. However, children aged 15–18 working for pay remains rare, with only 4 per cent of
girls who work doing so for pay.7 At the same time, we found an increase of about
17 percentage points in the likelihood that children performed domestic work. This result was
robust across genders, with significant results for both girls and boys. As with children aged
11–14, this increase is difficult to interpret. However, we also found that children worked
roughly eight fewer hours of total labour during the two weeks prior to data collection. This
result was significant for both girls and boys. Similar to children aged 11–14, this finding
supports the theory of change’s hypothesis that providing a cash transfer would free up
children aged 15–18 to attend school, rather than work for their family.
As discussed previously, beneficiaries in focus groups reported that children were involved in
a variety of domestic chores and agricultural activities despite attending school, but only a
7 The impact of 22 percentage points accounts for differences in demographics and changes over time. So, this impact does
not contradict the 4 per cent rate of work for pay among the control group. This result suggests that had neither group
received the LUL transfer, the LUL group would have seen higher rates of work for pay among girls 15–18 years of age.
57 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection Component
in Madagascar
minority of respondents stated that children performed work for pay. Furthermore, parents
largely believe that domestic chores do not interfere with children’s education because they
do not keep them from attending school.
Health, children aged 15–18
We found that children aged 15–18 saw no benefits from the LUL transfer in terms of health
and broader wellbeing outcomes. Similar to children aged 11–14, children aged 15–18 in all
three groups (control, TMDH and LUL) were healthy at baseline (21.2 per cent had been sick
during the two weeks prior to data collection) and even healthier at endline (7.8 per cent had
been sick during the two weeks prior to data collection). If children generally remain healthy,
sickness does not pose a major constraint to enrolling in or attending school. Only a small
share of children stand to benefit from the LUL transfer in terms of improving their health.
Schooling, children aged 6–10
The LUL transfer does not appear to have had an impact on 6- to 10-year-old children’s
enrolment across the same set of school outcomes as older age groups. Table G.13 shows that
there were no statistically significant results suggesting an improvement in younger
children’s schooling. With roughly 96 per cent of children aged 6–10 enrolled in school at
baseline, it is very likely that ceiling effects prevented the LUL transfer from having spill-
over effects for younger siblings.
Labour, children aged 6–10
We found mixed evidence on the effect of the LUL transfer on labour among children aged
6–10. We found that these younger children were 12 percentage points more likely to
perform domestic work than they would have been had their older siblings not received the
LUL transfer. Increased domestic labour aligns with the trend that we observed in older
children. We also found that working younger children were 14 percentage points less likely
to perform unpaid labour. The transfer may have had an indirect effect on children’s unpaid
labour, having alleviated the need to use children to complete work outside the house for
which they would not be paid. For example, rather than pulling children from school to help
with agricultural activities for which they would not be paid, the household may be able to
hire a worker instead. We do not have data to confirm or deny this scenario, and there are
many other possible explanations.
Health, children aged 6–10
We found no impacts on the health of children aged 6–10. In Table G.15, we show that the
LUL transfer did not improve health outcomes for children in this age range. As with older
children, younger children were rarely sick, leaving limited opportunity for the transfer to
improve health outcomes.
Evaluation Question 17: To what extent has the LUL top-up affected women’s
empowerment?
We found that the LUL transfer had meaningful impacts on girls’ empowerment and
households’ expectations of girls’ education. Table G.16 shows that children aged 15–18 in
LUL communities were 3 percentage points less likely to marry. This finding applies to both
girls and boys, as child marriage was rare in our sample (about 2 per cent in LUL
communes), which meant that we were unable to break the analysis apart by gender.
58 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection Component
in Madagascar
However, both girls and boys are likely to face pressure to withdraw from school if married.
We also found that among households with at least one daughter, the LUL transfer increased
the desired number of years of schooling for girls by 1.14 years. As seen in Figure F.32, the
desired number of years of schooling for girls and boys was nearly at parity by endline
(15.2 years versus 15.3 years). This constitutes a large increase from baseline, when the
desired number of years was 13.29 years for girls and 13.59 years for boys.
We found no evidence that the LUL transfer changed the household decision-making process
for women. Table G.17 shows eight different types of decision that a household can make,
and that the impacts of the LUL transfer on those types of decision were not significant. This
result is unsurprising for two reasons. First, most households reported that women played a
role in each type of decision (80 per cent or more). This high rate of reported involvement in
decision-making leaves little room for improvement. Second, the LUL transfer was not
targeted in a way that would alter gender dynamics in households. While households
participated in mother-leader initiatives that addressed gender, those pieces of the programme
cut across each of our groups in such a way that we would not expect impacts on gender and
decision-making. Indeed, these outcomes do not factor directly into the outcomes in the LUL
theory of change.
Beneficiaries had more positive perceptions of LUL’s impact on women’s empowerment.

credited training on household management and
finances, as well as the monetary resources
provided by the cash transfer, with helping to increase their decision-making power within
the household. For instance, a beneficiary from Camp Robin stated:
A few women who participated in focus groups reported that they did not have a say in
household decision-making. When asked how her family made spending decisions, a female
beneficiary from Manandroy replied, “Men don’t trust us with money.”
Evaluation Question 18: To what extent has the LUL top-up resulted in unintended impacts
(either positive or negative)?
The perceived impacts of the LUL transfer were generally positive and spanned a wider range
of outcomes than quantitative results would suggest. Households who received the LUL
transfer nearly unanimously stated that LUL had improved education for children. This
matches the findings described earlier in this memo, which detected increased enrolment and
decreased dropout. A larger majority of the households receiving the LUL transfer also stated
59 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection Component
in Madagascar
that they felt the transfer had improved nutrition outcomes. This does not align with the
findings described earlier, which suggest that there were no impacts on food security and
limited impacts on food consumption. However, qualitative data suggest that the LUL
transfer enhanced parents’ ability to provide snacks and other food provisions for children to
eat during the school day, which they believe motivated children to study and helped them
perform better at school.
Similarly, a slight majority of households stated that the LUL transfer improved health
outcomes. Again, the findings discussed earlier suggest that children were healthy enough at
baseline to leave limited room for improving health outcomes. Households receiving the LUL
transfer also felt the transfer improved clothing and their overall quality of life. While
perceptions of quality of life are inherently subjective, the fact that these households believe
that their lives improved suggests that the transfer may have had impacts broader than the
limited education and child wellbeing outcomes highlighted in the theory of change.
Qualitative respondents cited a few unintended impacts of the LUL programme. On the
positive side, respondents noted that the programme enabled students to be less stressed about
money and finances. For instance, a teacher stated that students were no longer ashamed of
not paying school fees, which helped motivate them to attend school. In another case, a
parent from Camp Robin explained that children were now able to focus on education and not
finances: “The real impact seen on kids’ behaviours since the transfers is that they do not
think about daily life as money is there. (…) If not, kids would think about what would we eat
at home? Will we have rice at home?”
On the negative side, beneficiaries and stakeholders cited instances of non-beneficiaries
becoming angry because they did not fully comprehend why they were ineligible for the
programme. For example, a school director from Manandroy noted that parents blamed him
for not benefiting from the programme. In addition, many respondents stated that non-
beneficiaries were jealous of or angry with beneficiaries. In a few cases, beneficiaries
recounted that they were expected to contribute more to community works and other resource
needs because they were LUL beneficiaries. For example, a parent from Betsizaraina
explained, “When the community needs to do something, [non-beneficiaries] withdraw,
saying that it’s for those who benefit from the programme, they have the money to do it.”
Lastly, a few education officials stated that enrolment had increased due to the LUL cash
transfer. A few respondents explained that this increased enrolment led to crowded classroom
conditions, which may affect students’ learning and performance. For example, one district
education official (chef de circonscription scolaire [CISCO]) from Ambohimahasoa noted,
“This academic year, for example, thanks to the LUL and the removal of the subscription fee,
there was a huge change [in enrolment]. The schools are crowded, and they don’t have
enough benches, and it’s sad to see that some students have to sit on the floor.”
Evaluation Question 19: To what extent has the programme influenced poverty reduction or
reduced the vulnerability of poor households in selected districts?
We found that the LUL transfer may have had some positive effect on household resilience to
shocks. Among LUL-eligible households who experienced at least one shock during the
previous year, LUL households were 11 percentage points more likely to have recovered
from all of those shocks. Among LUL households, the most common shocks were pests (17.3
60 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection Component
in Madagascar
per cent) and drought (25.2 per cent). However, the mechanism through which households
could have increased their resilience is unclear; we found no impacts on household savings,
salary, agricultural assets or agricultural sales. We also detect a 15 percentage point reduction
in the likelihood that anyone in the household received a salary. One possible mechanism for
this reduction is that the LUL supplement disincentived work. However, given that
respondents consistently viewed the 10,000 Ar transfer as a small amount, this explanation
does not clearly hold. To fully understand the labour market effects of the LUL supplement,
one would require a full time use module, which was not possible for this study.
6.5. Coherence

other national and international stakeholders?*

“It is teaching us about multi-coloured food, about
how to cook nutritional food.” Another beneficiary parent noted that she benefited from an
information session on finances, specifying, “It is awareness raising regarding savings
account.” Stakeholders explained that these awareness sessions provided a holistic approach
to improving children’s wellbeing beyond the area of education.
Stakeholders also mentioned several ongoing initiatives focused on improving education
access that were indirectly related to LUL. For example, FID noted that it partnered with the
Ministry of Education to conduct sensitizations on the importance of education, while
respondents from UNICEF described inclusive education efforts that included messaging to
enrol girls and students with disabilities in school. Respondents also noted that several
programmes targeted student dropout. A teacher from Betsizaraina mentioned that Humanity
Inclusive was implementing a project within a LUL commune focused on re-enrolling
children who had previously dropped out of school. A few stakeholders also discussed catch-
up classes implemented by the Ministry of Education and international organizations to help
children re-enrol in school. For students attending school, several respondents noted that
UNICEF provided school supplies to encourage participation in school.
There is also evidence that the government took steps to avoid duplication between LUL and
other assistance programmes. For example, some non-beneficiaries mentioned that they had
received in-kind donations (rice, oil, condensed milk) from the government. Non-
beneficiaries explained that they were selected to receive this aid because they did not benefit
from TMDH or LUL, demonstrating that the government attempted to target households
outside of TMDH and LUL through the provision of basic foodstuffs.
61 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection Component
in Madagascar
Evaluation Question 21: Were mechanisms put in place to ensure coordinated actions?*
While respondents described several mechanisms to support programme coordination, several
stakeholders called for stronger collaboration related to monitoring student attendance.
UNICEF and FID staff reported that they relied on meetings as well as implementation and
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) frameworks to ensure coordination throughout programme
implementation. A respondent from FID described these formal channels: “Regarding the
official communication, there are also official memos that is regarding the framing and the
implementation, the operational plan. There is an official communication but that doesn’t
prevent the officer from liaising with various interlocutors, all is well coordinated.” A
respondent from UNICEF also described working with relevant ministry counterparts to
support the realization of implementation plans related to LUL.
Several stakeholders also called for stronger coordination in terms of tracking programme
conditionality. Starting at the school level, many actors were involved in tracking attendance
to ensure students met the conditionality requirement for payment. The attendance list was
completed by teachers and signed off by the school director, before being verified by the
chief ZAP. The chief ZAP would then share the list with FID to make the payments. As
mentioned under Evaluation Question 10, teachers reported difficulty completing the
attendance sheets. In addition, a chief ZAP described being unable to verify the accuracy of
the attendance sheets: “Because, when they arrive at the level of the ZAP … and in general
those sheets, I don’t know whether the attendance sheets reflect the reality at school or not,
but if they are here the school director has accepted them that means, they are the true ones,
so I have to accept.” Challenges in accurately tracking attendance may have resulted in
beneficiaries receiving payments regardless of their attendance record, as noted under
Evaluation Question 8.
Evaluation Question 22: Has the programme approach leveraged resources of other
stakeholders and government agencies?*
Respondents explained that LUL saved time and resources by harmonizing its programming
with TMDH—specifically, by following the same targeting criteria and working with the
same implementing agency. A respondent from FID described how the targeting for LUL
built on what had already been done for TMDH:
We took the names of LUL beneficiaries from that same group [TMDH], with the
condition that they have children in the fifth grade or children going to secondary
school. Because, when we carried the [TMDH] surveys out, we have already stored
data on the number of children and their educational levels in a software program.
The targeting process under TMDH takes approximately a year to complete and draws on
existing data, creating time savings for LUL. An informant added that the World Bank
indirectly contributed to the design of LUL due to the programme’s reliance on TMDH’s
targeting criteria.
Stakeholders noted that LUL benefited from working with FID due to its familiarity with
TMDH and its existing knowledge on implementing conditional cash transfers. Respondents
also suggested that working with the same implementing partner saved resources, as some
FID staff involved in LUL were already paid by TMDH. An informant explained, “Only a
62 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection Component
in Madagascar
few people are paid by LUL. For example, the CEO of FID is supervising all the programmes
they implement, the CEO is also supervising the LUL. But the CEO of FID is funded at 100
per cent by the programmes of the World Bank.” Another stakeholder added that many FID
staff were involved in the implementation of LUL, even if only some were paid by UNICEF.

our own.” However, no respondents interviewed
for the evaluation indicated that any concrete steps had been taken to shift financing
responsibility to the government. On the contrary, one individual from the Ministry of
Population, Social Protection and Promotion of Women commented, “It is UNICEF’s role to
look for any investment for this project.” Another individual from FID stated, “[The transfer]
would stop if UNICEF doesn’t provide enough funding, it would stop.” Respondents from
UNICEF agreed that while social protection is a priority area for the government, no funds
have been earmarked to take on the LUL transfer because this particular programme will end
after the August payments are made to beneficiaries. UNICEF reported that they have
leveraged the apparent success of the LUL programme to secure additional funds for future
cash transfer schemes.
Evaluation Question 24: Is national support and involvement, as well as that of other
stakeholders, likely to continue after the three-year programme period?*
UNICEF’s sustainability strategy has emphasized capacity-building to ensure that tools and
skills are in place to continue the programme, but UNICEF respondents cautioned that
government buy-in will be critical to ensure that cash transfers are prioritized in the national
social protection plan. Respondents noted that government priorities change frequently, and
that education is likely to receive less attention than natural disasters and humanitarian crises.
Furthermore, frequent staff turnover poses an obstacle to sustainability. UNICEF focuses on
building technical capacity to deliver the programme (e.g., to identify families, ensure money
is transferred properly, interpret programmatic data) but people then transfer or leave and the
technical capacity leaves with them.
Several respondents noted strong interest in the external evaluation findings, as well as a
belief that the results of the evaluation may influence sustainability and future support for
cash transfers. One UNICEF informant stated, “I think LUL can be integrated into national
social protection plan … [but] I think the endline needs to show positive results. Then I think
it can be integrated. Without the evidence base, I don’t think [the government] would be
63 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection Component
in Madagascar
convinced to continue it.” A different UNICEF informant clarified that UNICEF’s goal is to
continue to support the government’s emphasis on social protection, but through different
schemes, such as a universal, unconditional cash transfer for households with children that is
less complicated than the current LUL program. Other informants made observations about
the lack of evidence of success for the current program, noting the need for data to inform
solutions to issues such as eligible households not enrolling in the programme, as noted in the
midterm evaluation report.
7. Evaluation conclusions
While LUL was an appropriate intervention to meet the needs of the target group,
beneficiaries did not view the transfer as sufficient to induce children to stay in school, or to
return to school for those children who had dropped out. Programme take-up levels have
increased at endline, but many eligible households still have not enrolled in the programme.
Our findings suggest that lack of awareness of the programme may be a barrier to take-up.
While we cannot say that the payment process was consistently timely, it was largely
effective in ultimately delivering the correct sum of money to beneficiaries. Beneficiaries
discussed mixed experiences regarding the resolution of complaints. It was unclear whether
the attendance data were correctly used to determine eligibility, and there were reports of
outdated TMDH beneficiary lists leading to inclusion and exclusion errors.
LUL led to improvements in school enrolment amongst recipients, but the transfer’s benefits
do not extend to other academic outcomes. We conclude that LUL has reduced cost-related
barriers to school access but that the programme needs to be paired with interventions that
directly target education quality in order to achieve impacts on dropout rates, grade
progression and learning outcomes. Further, although LUL led to improvements in school
enrollment and child labour amongst recipients, these changes did not extend to other
indicators of household wellbeing. We deduce that the transfer served as an incentive for
households to enroll children in school and offset lost wages from child labour, but that its
size was likely too small for households to cover other education expenditures or to change
aspects of their consumption behavior.
Finally, the LUL cash transfer benefitted from synergies with TMDH, though there may be
additional opportunities for partnerships with other national and international programmes—
particularly those focused on education quality and supply-side bottlenecks in the education
system. The LUL cash transfer will not continue in its current form after August 2021, as
UNICEF is moving towards an unconditional child benefit. While some informants expressed
concern about the heavy reliance on UNICEF for financing, others noted that the government
had started contributing to the TMDH cash transfer and were more optimistic about
government ownership of cash transfers as part of the national social protection plan moving
forward. Below we present conclusions organized by the OECD criteria that served as the
framework for this evaluation.
7.1. Relevance
The LUL transfer provided monetary support to households with children who might
otherwise not have been able to attend school. This transfer took place in an environment
where parent education levels were low; only 40 per cent of adults in the LUL-eligible
household had completed primary school. Despite the fact that enrolment remains high
64 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection Component
in Madagascar
among younger children, dropout remains incredibly common, with school enrolment
dropping by roughly 8 percentage points each year beginning at age 13. It is important to
support children’s education in such an environment where so few children remain enrolled
in school throughout their adolescence. However, this study also finds that households did
not view the transfer as sufficient to induce children to remain in school, or to return to
school for those children who no longer attended school. Most respondents stated that 10,000
AR would not be enough money to enrol a child in school. Even though the households were
receiving more than 10,000 AR in total as their transfer, due to TMDH credits, the amount
that a household would receive for enrolling a child or lose for a child dropping out is only
the 10,000 AR plus any 6eme or 3eme bonus. So, while transfers were quite relevant for the
setting of secondary school in Madagascar, the amount of the transfer was not large enough
to cover the entire opportunity cost of children aged 11-18 years.
7.2. Efficiency
LUL transfer take-up improved from midline to endline, but there remained additional
eligible households that did not enrol in the programme. The overall take-up rate was 67.1
per cent, meaning that nearly 33 per cent of households met the primary eligibility criteria of
having a child in the appropriate age range who could enrol in secondary school but did not
receive the LUL transfer. We expect that take-up would be less than 100 per cent. For
example, if a household had an 18-year-old who dropped out of school at age 11, it is
unlikely that any transfer could induce them to re-enrol in school. However, there is a sizable
minority (16.7 per cent) of households who have a child aged 11–18 years and who is already
enrolled in secondary school but did not receive the transfer. In other words, nearly one in six
households in our study met all conditions to receive the LUL transfer but did not do so. We
cannot say whether the child met further attendance requirements, so that could explain a part
of the disconnect between transfer eligibility and receipt. However, 36 per cent of those not
receiving LUL said they did not even know of the programme’s existence. Taken together,
these findings suggest that further advertisement of the LUL programme could have driven
the take-up rate higher. Furthermore, the criteria for LUL should be advertised to those not
receiving the cash transfer. Nearly all beneficiaries understood the criteria, so explaining the
criteria better might help the 16.7 per cent of eligible non-beneficiaries receive the
programme.
Most households (61 per cent) reported experiencing delays in receiving payments. However,
nearly all households (92 per cent) reported ultimately receiving the full amount to which
they were entitled. So, while we cannot say that the payment process was consistently timely,
it was largely effective in ultimately delivering the correct sum of money to beneficiaries.
Further, the fact that the LUL cash transfer was a supplement to the TMDH may have
incurred in cost and time savings in relation to a standalone programme. There were
challenges related to the complaints mechanism - with some beneficiaries reporting that their
complaints had not been responded to or resolved. Also, the conditionality of the top-up
transfer places a heavy administrative burden on programme implementers that continued to
pose challenges at the time of endline data collection. In some cases, it was not clear whether
the attendance data were correctly used to determine eligibility, and there were reports of
outdated TMDH beneficiary lists leading to inclusion and exclusion errors.
7.3. Effectiveness
LUL led to improvements in school enrolment amongst recipients, but the transfer’s benefits
do not extend to other academic outcomes. We found that a statistically significantly higher
65 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection Component
in Madagascar
proportion of LUL recipients were enrolled in school compared to the TMDH-only and
control groups. Furthermore, enrolment rates amongst LUL recipients at endline were higher
than the national average. School attendance rates were also high amongst LUL recipients
regardless of sex, district, or grade. This aligns with qualitative findings showing a
widespread perception that the LUL transfer has helped increase enrolment. However, high
dropout rates amongst 15–18-year-olds and poor grade progression outcomes suggest that
aside from the cost of enrolment, children are facing other problems that negatively affect
their academic outcomes. Based on these findings, we conclude that LUL has reduced cost-
related barriers to school access but that the programme needs to be paired with interventions
that directly target education quality in order to achieve impacts on dropout rates, grade
progression and learning outcomes.
7.4. Impact
Although LUL led to improvements in quantitative measures of school enrollment and child
labour amongst recipients, these changes did not extend to other indicators of household
wellbeing, such as resilience, female empowerment, or food security. Though focus group
participants described spending LUL cash transfer money primarily on educational expenses
(such as school supplies, uniforms, and school fees) and food (including snacks for children
to take to school), we did not detect any positive impacts on household consumption,
education expenditure, agricultural activity, and food security. From these findings we
deduce that the transfer served as an incentive for households to enroll children in school and
offset lost wages from child labour, but that its size was likely too small for households to
cover other education expenditures or to change aspects of their consumption behavior. This
conclusion is reinforced by the fact that most surveyed households perceived the transfer size
as too small to enroll a child in school. While focus group participants reported that the LUL
transfer had made a difference in their ability to cover educational expenses, they may be
lumping in TMDH and LUL benefits when discussing the impact of the cash transfer on
their lives.
LUL improved schooling outcomes amongst eligible households, but these positive impacts
were limited to certain age and sex subgroups. We found that the transfer improved school
enrollment amongst girls aged 11 to 14 years old and amongst boys aged 15 to 18 years old.
This is largely in alignment with the perceptions of programme stakeholders and
beneficiaries, who reported that enrollments had increased due to the LUL program. We did
not detect any improvements in enrollment amongst 6- to 10-year-olds. It should be noted
that these effects only capture the marginal impact of the LUL programme and do not reflect
the combined impacts of the LUL and TMDH transfers. We would likely find broader
impacts on enrollment by looking at the combined impact of LUL and TMDH. This would,
however, necessitate another study, given that our current study design is not intended to
detect the combined impact of LUL and TMDH.
We found that LUL reduced participation in paid and unpaid labour but increased
participation in domestic work amongst children in eligible households. LUL decreased
unpaid labour amongst 6- to 10-year-olds and reduced paid labour amongst 11- to 14-year-
old boys and 15- to 18-year-old girls. The transfer also reduced the overall time that children
spent working amongst children aged 11 and above. On the other hand, we found that LUL
increased domestic work amongst eligible children across all age groups. Qualitative data
suggest that children continued to engage in a variety of domestic labour activities while
receiving the LUL transfer, though most parents believed this did not affect children’s
schooling. However, these increases in domestic work likely reflect changes in children’s
66 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection Component
in Madagascar
contribution to overall household wellbeing as they spend less time on paid labour outside the
home and more time on household chores. We found no evidence that the LUL transfer
changed the household decision-making process for women. Beneficiaries had more positive
perceptions of LUL’s impact on women’s empowerment.
7.5. Coherence
The LUL cash transfer benefitted from synergies with TMDH, though there may be
additional opportunities for partnerships with other national and international programmes.
Stakeholders noted that LUL built upon existing systems and practices under TMDH, which
increased programme efficiency. Aside from the cash transfer, LUL beneficiaries also
participated in other components under TMDH, such as sensitizations to improve child
wellbeing. Most ongoing programs that overlapped with LUL also focused on improving
access to education through interventions targeting demand. However, stakeholders and
beneficiaries discussed concerns related to quality education, indicating the importance of
efforts to also address supply-side bottlenecks in the education system.
7.6. Sustainability
The LUL transfer will not continue in its current form after the final payments are made to
beneficiaries in August. Respondents interviewed for this evaluation emphasized the
importance of the evaluation findings to build the evidence base and, ideally, garner
government support for future cash transfer schemes. For its part, UNICEF advocates for a
simpler, unconditional cash transfer scheme with a lower administrative burden. The
complexity of the LUL cash transfer’s conditionality requirement was considered an obstacle
to sustainability. Some informants expressed concern about the heavy reliance on UNICEF as
the external funder of the LUL cash transfer, but others noted that the government of
Madagascar had started contributing to the TMDH cash transfer and were more optimistic
about government ownership of cash transfers as part of the national social protection plan
moving forward. However, the fact that there are no government funds earmarked for the
LUL supplemental cash transfer suggests a lack of government buy-in and investment in
education cash transfers, despite the government’s commitment to access to education and
social protection.
8. Lessons learned
Several lessons emerged from the evaluation findings that can inform future cash transfer
programming, especially cash transfers focusing on education. In particular, the results of this
programme evaluation highlight the following lessons:
Focusing objectives of cash transfer programming. It is important for a cash transfer to
have clearly defined goals, and that these goals are reasonably attainable for the value of the
transfer. The primary avenue through which a cash transfer initiates change is by alleviating
the constraints a household faces due to the lack of resources. A transfer’s effect on its
recipients will be proportional to its monetary value. The primary goal of the LUL transfer
was to support children’s transition to secondary school, especially as they lost TMDH
support. However, the secondary goals (listed in the Terms of Reference) of outcomes such
as food security and savings were likely not in line with the size or structure of the transfer.
67 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection Component
in Madagascar
In future cash transfer programming, the goals should be carefully identified and the transfer
structured to attain those goals.
The administrative burden of reporting conditionality can create challenges. Education
cash transfers such as LUL require efficient and accurate reporting of attendance data in order
to maintain conditionality. However, the process of conditionality reporting requires
administrative work at different levels, from education officials to school administrators and
teachers. This can become an administrative burden that creates frustration among teachers
and school administrators. Further, if the conditionality reporting is too burdensome, it can
affect the accuracy and frequency of attendance data reported. In future cash transfer
programming, conditionality reporting should be simplified as much as possible to minimize
the administrative work required of school staff and to ensure that attendance data are
reportedly accurately and with the required frequency.
Cash transfer supplement programs require frequent coordination between
administrative systems. Cash transfer supplement programmes such as TMDH-LUL require
special attention to coordination between the administrative systems of both programmes in
order to avoid inclusion/exclusion errors. LUL beneficiary lists were tied to TMDH
beneficiary lists, which created challenges for including newly eligible LUL beneficiaries and
excluding beneficiaries who died or dropped out of school. In future cash transfer supplement
programmes, implementing agencies should ensure that beneficiary lists are frequently
updated, and that there is adequate coordination between the beneficiary lists of both
programmes.
It can be challenging to investigate a cash transfer supplement programme
qualitatively. Our experiences studying the LUL transfer qualitatively suggest that it is
challenging to disentangle perceived impacts of the LUL from those of the TMDH, given that
beneficiaries often think about the TMDH-LUL programme together. Fortunately, our
quantitative impact evaluation design allows us to examine the LUL programme separately
from TMDH. Therefore, it is important for studies of supplemental cash transfer programmes
to include a mixed-methods design that allows for rigorous examination of the supplemental
cash transfer while still capturing the more holistic perceptions about the entire joint
programme.
9. Recommendations
The evaluation team developed recommendations for the LUL programme based on the research
findings and conclusions of this study. Based on a workshop conducted with duty bearers, the
team validated and prioritized recommendations. Our recommendations are described in detail
below.
1. In future cash transfer schemes, UNICEF, FID, and MPPSF should ensure there
is a clearly defined and well-functioning complaints mechanism that all beneficiaries
are aware of. Qualitative data indicated that case management services for the TMDH-
LUL do not appear to be consistently functioning as intended. In particular, beneficiaries
reported a lack of follow-up on complaints filed with FID. In addition, mother leaders
appear to be collecting grievances for the programme, though complaints made through
mother leaders also appeared to be unresolved. In future cash transfer schemes, UNICEF,
FID, and MPPSF should find ways to ensure that the complaints mechanism is structured
68 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Social Protection Component
in Madagascar
and that the responsibilities for collecting grievances and following up with beneficiaries
on complaints are clear. In particular, the key personnel who are tasked with transmitting
beneficiary complaints to FID and relaying follow-up information to beneficiaries must
be clearly identified. It is important to have multiple channels accessible to beneficiaries
to make complaints (for instance, both phone and in-person), that the process of filing
complaints does not exclude illiterate beneficiaries, and that staff responsible for
complaints are not the same ones who are distributing the cash payments. Further, FID
should consider developing a mechanism for tracking complaints and communicating
complaint status to beneficiaries. This may include generating numbers to identify
complaints and storing information about each complaint in the programme’s monitoring
systems. Beneficiaries should be able to consult about the status of their complaint, and
periodic communications should be made to beneficiaries when complaints are
resolved/addressed.
2. When payments are delayed, FID should ensure beneficiaries are promptly
informed of when they will receive the next payment.
Programme stakeholders cited COVID-19 and safety issues as the primary reasons for
payment delays. While most beneficiaries ultimately received the full amount they were
due, they did not receive consistent information as to when and why payments were
delayed. Though FID representatives noted that mother leaders and CPS are tasked with
relaying this information to beneficiaries, data suggests there may be communication
breakdowns along the way. Moving forward, to retain beneficiary trust and facilitate their
planning, payment delays should be promptly and clearly communicated to beneficiaries.
3. UNICEF should work to ensure greater synergies between cash transfers and
ongoing interventions targeting education quality.
Qualitative data revealed that non-financial barriers to education were related to poor
education quality. For example, some students dropped out of school due to failing
qualifying exams and limited parental support for education was influenced by a lack of
confidence in the school system. While LUL overlapped with several initiatives aiming to
improve access to education, these interventions generally lacked a focus on education
quality. Going forward, UNICEF should ensure linkages between the cash transfers and
education quality interventions to provide a more comprehensive approach to overcoming
the existing barriers to education that students face.
4. UNICEF, FID, and MPPSPF should consider a universal cash transfer scheme
with a smaller administrative burden to ensure payments are delivered on time
consistently.
The conditionality of the top-up transfer places a heavy administrative burden on
programme implementers, and this continued to pose challenges at the time of endline
data collection. In some cases, it was unclear whether the attendance data were correctly
used to determine eligibility, and there were reports of outdated TMDH beneficiary lists
leading to inclusion and exclusion errors. The administrative burden of reporting
conditionality has already been identified by UNICEF as a challenge to sustainability, and
the organization’s plan to move towards an unconditional, universal child benefit would
avoid this issue. However, while the LUL programme continues, FID should consider
simplifying the process of reporting conditionality as much as possible, to alleviate the
burden on teachers and school management and ensure that the reported attendance data
are accurate. Further, FID should ensure that the process is clearly communicated to
stakeholders.

in Madagascar
5. UNICEF should consider a larger transfer amount, combined with “soft
conditioning mechanisms,” to maximize impact and ensure that enrolment and
attendance gains continue as the programme transitions towards a universal cash
transfer. A larger transfer per child could lead to bigger impacts and would address the
concern about 10,000 AR being too small to induce change. Incorporating “soft
conditioning” mechanisms, such as messaging about the importance of attendance, could
help sustain enrolment and attendance gains observed through the LUL cash transfer
supplement. This messaging could be targeted at children in key transition grades (7eme
and 3eme) who are particularly vulnerable to drop out.
6. UNICEF should continue to advocate for government support of cash transfers
and consider developing a contribution schedule with increasing annual targets for
government contributions to the universal cash transfer. As UNICEF moves towards
a universal cash transfer, continuing advocacy could foster government buy-in of cash
transfers, and a contribution schedule could encourage increasing levels of government
support of cash transfers going forward.

Introduction
Le décrochage scolaire est un problème grave à Madagascar, de nombreux enfants
quittant l'école avant d'avoir pu passer d'un niveau à l'autre. Environ 79 % des enfants
s'inscrivent à l'école primaire dans tout le pays, alors que le taux de scolarisation
tombe à seulement 27 % pour le secondaire (UNESCO, 2015). En outre, le
redoublement est fréquent dans les écoles malgaches et est susceptible de provoquer
l'abandon scolaire (Wills, Reuter, Gudiel, Hessert et Sewall, 2014).
Le transfert monétaire supplémentaire Let Us Learn (LUL) vient s'ajouter au
programme de Transfert Monétaire pour le Développement Humain (TMDH) – qui est
un programme national, afin de favoriser la transition des enfants vers l'école
secondaire et leur maintien à l'école. Le transfert TMDH est une subvention destinée
aux ménages ayant des enfants de 10 ans et moins. Le Ministère de La Population,
de la Protection Sociale et de La Promotion de La Femme (MPPSPF) du
gouvernement de Madagascar a initié le TMDH dans le cadre d'un effort coordonné
pour encourager la scolarisation des enfants, avec un accent particulier sur les enfants
vulnérables. Le transfert LUL soutient les enfants de 11 à 18 ans dont les jeunes frères
et sœurs reçoivent la TMDH. La Banque mondiale et l'UNICEF siègent à un comité
de coordination qui contribue à la mise en œuvre de la TMDH et de la LUL.
L'UNICEF utilise le transfert LUL pour étendre le soutien de la TMDH aux frères et
sœurs plus âgés en âge de fréquenter l'école secondaire. Le supplément LUL est un
transfert ciblé sur les enfants, basé sur l'âge et le statut de l'enfant à l'école. Pour en
bénéficier, les bénéficiaires potentiels doivent répondre aux critères de la TMDH et
avoir un autre enfant inscrit à l'école secondaire ou se préparant à y entrer. Afin de
tirer des leçons de la mise en œuvre de ces deux programmes et d’avoir des
données probantes des impacts de ces programmes, le MPPSPF, l’UNICEF et la
Banque Mondiale se sont associés dans une rigoureuse évaluation d’impact qui
a débuté en 2016. Toutefois, au vu des résultats des évaluations mi-parcours et
des contraintes de mise en œuvre occasionnant des reports et de retour de
fonds, l’UNICEF veut redéfinir le focus et la portée de l’évaluation finale du
TMDH-LUL.
75 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Programme in Madagascar
Contexte et justification
L’approche commune adoptée entre l’équipe de la Banque Mondiale et de l’UNICEF
a été de construire une évaluation d’impact rigoureuse expérimentale, basée sur une
approche Random Control Trial. Après la randomisation des fokontany en Juin 2016
la veille du démarrage du TMDH-LUL, une enquête de référence a été établie en fin
2016/début 2017 au sein de 14 communes control, 26 communes LUL+TMDH et 12
communes TMDH (TMDH non LUL). L’échantillon a été solide avec 4,484 ménages
enquêtés qui couvrent 27,437 individus.
En fin 2018, une première évaluation à mi-parcours a été conduite à la fois pour le
TMDH et le TMDH-LUL. Spécifiquement pour le TMDH l'évaluation d'impact vise à
tester le succès des principaux objectifs du programme LUL. L'objectif du programme
de transfert d'argent de LUL est de soutenir la transition des adolescents de l'école
primaire à l'école secondaire (de la septième à la sixième année). En fournissant un
revenu supplémentaire aux ménages, le programme vise à soutenir la scolarisation et
à maintenir les garçons et les filles à l'école au moins jusqu'à l'achèvement du premier
cycle du secondaire.
L'évaluation globale (baseline 2016, mi-parcours 2018 et finale 2020) couvre quatre
critères : les impacts, l'efficacité, l'efficience et la pertinence. L’évaluation à mi-
parcours s’est concentrée sur les impacts et l'efficacité du transfert LUL. Les résultats
nous ont révélés des tendances positives qui ont permis de valider les hypothèses de
la Théorie du Changement mais a également soulevés des lacunes.
Le premier constat est que le taux d’adhésion au programme TMDH-LUL était
quelque peu faible, avec seulement 63 % des ménages éligibles au LUL recevant
le transfert et que les 37 % restants des ménages éligibles n’ont pas adhéré au
transfert malgré les incitations.
Résultats en matière d'éducation : Nous avons constaté que le transfert a amélioré
les résultats scolaires des enfants de 11 à 14 ans, mais pas ceux de 5 à 10 ans ou de
15 à 18 ans. Les enfants âgés de 11 à 14 ans et éligibles à la LUL avaient 6 points de
pourcentage de plus pour s'inscrire à l'école et passaient environ 14 minutes
supplémentaires à étudier par jour. Nous avons également étudié les résultats
scolaires des enfants, mais n'avons constaté aucun impact pour les enfants de tous
âges. Plus de 90 % des enfants âgés de 11 à 14 ans étaient inscrits à l'école au départ,
ce qui crée un effet de plafond avec peu de marge de manœuvre pour améliorer la
scolarisation des enfants de cette tranche d'âge à mi-parcours.
Constatations sur le travail : Nous n'avons pas trouvé de preuves que le transfert de
la LUL a réduit le travail des enfants éligibles. Nous avons constaté que le transfert a
réduit la probabilité que les enfants âgés de 5 à 10 ans travaillent contre rémunération
d'environ 8 points de pourcentage, mais seulement 1,4 % environ travaillaient contre
rémunération au niveau de base, ce qui ne constitue pas un changement significatif.
Nous avons testé plusieurs mesures du travail des enfants, notamment pour savoir si
les enfants travaillaient contre rémunération ou s'ils effectuaient des travaux
domestiques, ainsi que le temps consacré au travail non rémunéré. Le programme n'a
eu d'impact sur aucun de ces indicateurs du travail des enfants.
76 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Programme in Madagascar
Résultats des dépenses en matière d'éducation : Nous avons constaté que les
ménages LUL ne sont pas plus susceptibles que les ménages TMDH uniquement de
dépenser pour les coûts directs de l'éducation. Nous n'avons constaté aucun effet sur
les dépenses liées aux frais de scolarité, aux droits de scolarité et aux fournitures
scolaires. L'une des principales voies qu'un transfert d'argent devrait emprunter pour
améliorer l'éducation des enfants consiste à couvrir les coûts directs de l'école. Une
fois qu'un ménage reçoit le revenu supplémentaire, il devrait pouvoir assumer ces
coûts directs.
Ce rapport conclut que l'utilisation du transfert LUL a été trop faible pour que l'on
puisse constater un quelconque impact sur les résultats au niveau des enfants
et des ménages. Seuls 63 % des ménages éligibles se sont inscrits au transfert LUL.
But, objectifs et portée de l’évaluation - refocussé
Le but et utilisation des résultats restent les mêmes, c’est-à-dire que l'évaluation
servira à informer l'avenir du programme et à renseigner les décideurs et les donateurs
sur l'impact que le programme national a eu sur la réduction de la vulnérabilité des
personnes pauvres. Les résultats et les leçons tirées de l'évaluation seront utilisés
pour développer davantage le système national de protection sociale à Madagascar.
Les objectifs restent également les mêmes8 mais les portés doivent subir quelques
modifications :
- Rajouts de questions d’évaluations et requêtes additionnels spécifiques au vu
des préoccupations issus des résultats de l’évaluation à mi-parcours et des
problèmes rencontrés.
- Prise en charge de la collecte des données quantitatives et qualitatives si
auparavant celle-ci a été confiée à un autre partenaire ;
- Renforcement du volet qualitatif et nécessité d’une analyse plus approfondie
des « pourquoi et des comment ». Le rapport précèdent a donné, bien que
limité par le taux d’adhésion, des mesures robustes des attributions – valeurs
ajoutées du LUL par rapport au TMDH seulement. Ces mesures manquent
toutefois d’une compréhension précise des raisons des changements et surtout
d’absence de changements ;
- Meilleur alignement des analyses sur les normes et principes spécifiques
d’évaluations à l’UNICEF. Le rapport à mi-parcours s’est beaucoup plus
apparenté à une recherche d’évaluation d’impact qu’à une évaluation (voir
politiques et normes d’évaluation UNEG et ceux spécifiquement pour
l’UNICEF).

Pertinence policy in Madagascar?
According to the midline report: LUL eligible households were
better off in terms of education and other indicators of child
wellbeing already at baseline than LUL non eligible
households. An HH must have at least one child with
completed primary education to be eligible for LUL. With limited
resources for social protection, should we focus on supporting
the completion of primary education or transition to secondary?
Can the final report address more in depth this issue and
provide some recommendation based on evidence?
How effectively have the scholarship programme identified
children who are not-in-school for socio-economic
reasons and brought them back, and maintained them into the
school system? Can we organize qualitative data collection/
focus groups with out of school children in potentially LUL
eligible households to understand their barriers in enrolling
them to school?

Annex H. Analysis Plan
Pre-analysis tests
The primary purposes of the baseline data collection are to measure the starting point for
everyone in the sample and to check that the treatment and control conditions are balanced
before the start of the intervention. In theory, randomization should create groups with
statistically similar group means on outcome and control indicators, but this may not always
happen. For this reason, we measured each group at baseline and tested for differences to
determine whether the identification process led to a balanced sample.
We found that the LUL, TMDH, and control groups were similar for almost all outcome and
control variables. This suggests that the control group is a suitable counterfactual for the
treatment group. Most importantly, we found equivalence for the primary outcomes of the
study, including child education. We tested more than 120 indicators and found only nine
statistically significant differences between the three groups. No one group consistently
performed better or worse than the other two, with the difference between groups varying
across indicators. Additionally, the sample size is quite large, so we can detect small and
relatively meaningless differences as statistically significant. Lastly, this number of
differences is acceptable, especially considering that we expected to find a certain number of
significant differences due to the number of tests that we ran. Specifically, we expected to
find one spurious result for every 20 indicators tested, since we set the alpha level to 0.05 for
significance. The number of statistically significant differences we found falls well within the
range expected, given the number of indicators.
Follow-up analysis
We used a multi-arm, cluster RCT design with difference-in-differences (DID) regressions to
test the effect of the TMDH and the TMDH + LUL supplement on educational outcomes and
household wellbeing. Our analysis relied on the randomised assignment of communes to
different study arms to create a counterfactual. First, communes were randomly assigned to
receive the TMDH transfer or to be a control commune. Then, communes receiving the
TMDH transfer were randomly assigned to also receive the LUL or to only receive the
TMDH. So, the control group received no transfer, the TMDH-only and the LUL group
received the TMDH transfer, and only the LUL group received the LUL supplemental
transfer. These groups were equal, on average, before the transfer, so any differences at
midline or endline are due to the transfer.
Our objective in this analysis was to answer two general classes of questions. First, did the
TMDH transfer improve outcomes for LUL-eligible older children on its own? Second, did
the LUL supplement improve key outcomes for LUL-eligible children relative to those who
received only the TMDH transfer? In other words, what, if any, additional benefit does the
LUL supplement provide above and beyond that provided by the TMDH alone?
DID analysis took the strong design of an RCT and exploited the multiple rounds of data
collection to improve the precision of our estimates to answer these questions. DID analysis
compare the change in treatment outcomes to the change in control outcomes. If there were a
statistically significant difference in the outcome changes, we can attribute the difference to
the transfer. DID analysis also control for any chance variation between the groups prior to
181 | AIR.ORG Endline Report for UNICEF’s Let Us Learn Cash Transfer Supplement Programme in
Madagascar
the transfer as well as for any common time trends. If there was no chance variation and no
common time trends, then this DID model would function the same as a single-difference model.
We used cluster robust cross-sectional DID regression techniques to estimate the impact of
the TMDH and TMDH + LUL supplement. We estimate the following equation:
𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 = 𝜙+𝛼 ⋅𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 +𝛼 ⋅𝑇𝑀𝐷𝐻 +𝛼 ⋅𝐿𝑈𝐿 ⋅𝑇𝑀𝐷𝐻 +𝛽 ⋅𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 ⋅𝑇𝑀𝐷𝐻
ℎ𝑐𝑡 1 𝑡 2 ℎ 3 ℎ𝑐 ℎ 1 𝑡 ℎ
+𝛽 ⋅𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 ⋅𝐿𝑈𝐿 ⋅𝑇𝑀𝐷𝐻 +𝛾 ⋅𝐶 +𝛾 ⋅𝐻 +𝜀
2 𝑡 𝑐ℎ ℎ 1 ℎ𝑐 2 ℎ ℎ𝑐𝑡
where the explanatory variables are defined as:
• 𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 measures the outcome of interest for child 𝑐 in household ℎ at time 𝑡
ℎ𝑐𝑡
• 𝐿𝑈𝐿 is an indicator variable equal to 1 if child 𝑐 in household ℎ is LUL-supplement
ℎ𝑐
eligible and 0 otherwise
• 𝑇𝑀𝐷𝐻 is an indicator variable equal to 1 for all households ℎ in TMDH-only or
ℎ
LUL communes, and 0 for households in control communes
• 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 is an indicator equal to 1 for observations at follow-up and zero for baseline
𝑡
observations
• 𝐶 is a set of child-level variables for child 𝑐 in household ℎ
ℎ𝑐
• 𝐻 is a set of household-level variables for child 𝑐 in household ℎ
ℎ
• 𝜀 is unexplained model error for child 𝑐 in household ℎ.
ℎ𝑐
The primary parameters of interest are 𝛽 and 𝛽 . The parameter 𝛽 measures the change in
1 2 1
the outcome that can be attributed to the TMDH transfer. The parameter 𝛽 provides the
2
additional effect the LUL supplement has on key outcomes given that LUL households
already experience the effect of TMDH through the 𝛽 term. If LUL recipients had outcomes
1
that were better or worse than TMDH-only households, 𝛽 will be statistically significantly
2
different than zero. The total impact of the combined transfers on LUL beneficiaries is simply
𝛽 +𝛽 .
1 2
The parameters 𝛼 , 𝛼 , and 𝛼 control for any chance variation across treatment arms or over
1 2 3
time. The coefficient 𝛼 controls for common time trends, so observations at baseline are
1
comparable to observations at follow-up or endline. Next, 𝛼 controls for any time-invariant
2
differences at baseline between the TMDH-only arm and the other arms. Lastly, 𝛼 controls
3
for any time-invariant differences at baseline between the LUL recipient arm and the
other arms.
The parameters 𝛾 and 𝛾 improve the precision of the impact estimate by control for
1 2
child-level and household-level factors. However, they are unnecessary from a technical
perspective because the variables 𝐿𝑈𝐿 and 𝑇𝑀𝐷𝐻 should be uncorrelated with
𝑐ℎ ℎ
other variables.
We used cluster robust standard errors at the commune level to account for correlation
amongst observations specific to the commune. This approach ensured that we detect an
effect of the transfer only when it truly had an effect.

Introduction
I work for the American Institutes for Research, an organization based in the United States. I
would like to ask you to help me by being in a study. But before I do, I want to explain what
will happen if you decide to participate.
Participation
I will ask you to participate in a discussion about your opinions about school. The discussion
will take about two hours. I will ask you a series of questions and there are no right or wrong
answers. By being in this study, you will help me learn more about your feelings about
school.
I will be taking notes and if you are comfortable, I would like to record our discussion.
Risk
You do not have to be a part of this study if you do not want to be. What you decide won’t
affect your education in anyway. I won’t be upset and no one else will be upset if you don’t
want to be a part of the study. If you decide to participate, you can stop at any time. If there’s
any question that you don’t want to answer, you don’t have to answer it. If there is anything
you don’t understand let me know so I can explain it to you.
Benefits
I do not have anything to give you when we finish our discussion. It will help us understand
how the LuL program is working.
Confidentiality
No one will not know what you have said. When I tell other people about my study, I will not
use your name, and no one will be able to tell who I am talking about.
Voluntary Participation
Your parents said it is ok for you to be a part of my study. But if you do not want to be in the
study, you do not have to be. If you want to be in the study now and change your mind later,
that is okay.
You can say no to being a part of this study. It is up to you. And if you say ‘yes’ now, you
can change your mind later.
More Information
If you have any questions about this study you may contact UNICEF Madagascar or [include
contact name] at Tel: [include contact telephone number].
Informed Consent
Do you understand what I have told you or have any questions?
Would you like to participate? [Please initial or make an ‘X’ in the space below.]
