Executive Summary
Purpose, Including Intended Audience(s)
The purpose of this external evaluation was to learn and assess the results of Education Cannot Wait (ECW) facilitated Multi
Year Resilience Programme (MYRP)-2019-2021 in the State of Palestine (SoP) and provide recommendations for any future
MYRP in SoP in terms of its design and implementation modality.
The main users of the evaluation are the Ministry of Education (MoE), ECW, Education Cluster partners, the Education Sector
Working Group (ESWG) members, the donor community, and key education stakeholders.
Objectives and Brief Description of Intervention
The ECW/MYRP was implemented in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip between 2019 and 2023. The programme aimed at
ensuring that crisis-affected vulnerable and marginalized girls and boys (6-17 years) have sustained and safe access to
improved quality and relevance of education in inclusive and protective environments. The programme sought to achieve this
through three outcomes:
Outcome 1 Improved, sustained and safe equitable, inclusive and gender-responsive access to education and
learning opportunities for crisis-affected vulnerable and marginalized girls and boys (6-17 years old)
Outcome 2 Improved quality and relevance of education for crisis-affected vulnerable and marginalized girls and boys
(6-17 years old) in inclusive and protective environments
Outcome 3 Strengthened capacity of the education system to respond to chronic humanitarian needs and to deliver
a coordinated and mainstreamed response
Methodology
The evaluation employed a mixed methods approach, which collects both qualitative and quantitative data. The following data
collection tools were developed and deployed by the consultancy team: MYRP Beneficiary Survey, MYRP Beneficiary FGD,
Teacher Training and Recruitment Survey, Implementing Staff (Teacher) KIIs, and Client and Stakeholder KIIs. The sample
achieved includes 807 MYRP Beneficiary Surveys, 74 MYRP Beneficiary FGD (with a total of 359 participants), 123 Teacher
Training and Recruitment Surveys, 75 Implementing Staff (Teacher) KIIs, and 33 Client and Stakeholder KIIs.
Main Conclusions
The report identified the following conclusions, linking to each of the key evaluation questions:
 EQ1: How relevant, appropriate, and significant is the SoP ECW/MYRP at the country level? How can these aspects
be strengthened in any future MYRPs in SoP?
A review of the approach taken to respond to, and reduce differentiated inequalities and needs (including those
resulting from age, gender, geographic, disability and/or socio-economic factors), suggests that MYRP design and
implementation intended to impact vulnerable groups by focusing on schools located in areas most impacted by
protracted crises, where children face barriers to access and continuity of education and communities are
experiencing the highest levels of poverty, limited access to services and resources, and are isolated in a manner that
increases their vulnerabilities and marginalisation, while reinforcing certain tradition norms, behaviour and practices
detrimental to specific groups or individuals. Further efforts to pivot programming to emergent COVID-19 needs also
further promoted a view of intended responsiveness to the needs of children in target zones. The reprogramming of
MYRP highlights the programme’s flexibility and adaptiveness. Allocation of ‘flexible funds’ also highlights the
responsiveness of MYRP in SoP. However, the lack of strong MEAL and outcome monitoring/documentation, and
dependence on self-reporting of implementing partners, makes it challenging to establish the degree to which
programming directly responded to the priority needs of children in SoP. This stems from disjointed design affecting
the establishment of a harmonised MEAL framework, potentially compounded by ECW reporting requirements, i.e.
‘reach’ figures. A related issue is the disjointedness and fragmentation of interventions due to siloed projectisation
within the wider MYRP design.
| iii |
EQ2: To what extent is the SoP ECW/MYRP aligning with, complementing, and leveraging international and national

humanitarian-development system(s) and related plans, policies, and frameworks? How can these aspects be
strengthened in future SoP MYRPs?
The SoP MYRP was aligned and integrated with other systems and related plans, including in the national education
system and related governmental plans (Education Sector Strategic Plan, Joint Advocacy and Protection Strategy,
the UNRWA Mid-Term Strategy, the Humanitarian Response Plan, and the National Inter-sectoral Violence against
Children Strategy in the Context of Covid-19 2021-2023); however, this may have been (in the case of this specific
MYRP) to the detriment of differentiable impact arising from ECW’s seed funding, and certainly to the detriment of
EiE- and nexus-focussed outcomes and impacts. The core constituency of vulnerable and marginalised children, who
are the main targets as per ECW’s strategic priorities and articulated in the MYRP as Bedouins, Herders etc., were
not demonstrably served by its programming. Likewise, there is an apparent lack of alignment with the wider
Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP). To be concrete, given that the MYRP did not appear to have its own coherent
theory of change, that it was used to fund subcomponents of other siloed education programmes and activities, rather
than a cohesive, holistic set of its own interventions, and that there was limited coordination between the implementing
partners, clear impacts and effects arising from highly atomised ECW-funded activities were difficult to identify.
 EQ3: How does the SoP ECW/MYRP align with, complement, and leverage ECW Global strategic plan, core functions
and other investment modalities (FER)? How can this be strengthened?
There was a nominal alignment to ECW’s global strategic plan and objectives described in the planning phase and
initial application, namely to support in the education of 8 million children across the whole of ECW’s portfolio, and to
increase political support to education in crises; increase financing for education in crises; Improve joint planning and
responses; strengthen capacity to respond; and improve accountability. However, given the high degree of
integration/fragmentation across modality types, partners, and regions, it is challenging to establish the degree to
which ECW actually contributed to the achievement of these objectives. Strengthening this alignment, and desired
impacts, have been addressed in the relevant section below.
 EQ4: To what extent is the SoP ECW/MYRP managed in an efficient, timely and transparent manner? How can these
aspects be strengthened in any future MYRPs?
The efficiency of the MYRP, given the high degree of integration in other programmes implemented by the partners,
can be seen as a strength of the programme, in spite of the typical bureaucratic and other hurdles faced in the course
of implementation. Primary delays in implementation arise in early phases of the project, and as a result of the COVID
crisis; however, partners managed to achieve required outputs before the end of the programme.
 EQ5: To what extent and how has the SoP ECW/MYRP created political commitment to address the needs of children
and youth (boys/girls) affected by conflict and crisis on a global and in-country level?
The MYRP has garnered significant political commitment from domestic leadership in SoP. This is most clearly
expressed in the MoE’s leading role in the MYRP’s governance structure, where the Minister of Education is co-chair
of the Steering Committee (SC) and a senior MoE official from the MoE’s ECW Core team is the co-chair of the
Technical Committee (TC) (ECW narrative report for period 01/2020 – 12/2020, 2021). Since December 2019, the
MoE has taken a series of steps to affirm and consolidate its role in ECW/MYRP governance. These include creating
a team of six officials to liaise with the MYRP’s PMU on management issues, and fostering communication between
MoE officials and the SC and TC by bringing six and 11 officials to them respectively (Ibid.). During 2021, the technical
meetings including the Y3 reprogramming exercise had MoE officials at the core of discussions. The MoE’s Deputy
Minister led the exercise with the PMU and all five MYRP partners involved (Ibid.). UNICEF SOP’s most recent
narrative report to ECW states that this political commitment has helped ensure ‘solid technical discussions and better
information flow within the Ministry and with the ECW partners’ (Ibid., p. 14). Furthermore, MoE has played a proactive
leadership role, appointing a dedicated focal person, reorganising the governance structure, and providing an office
space to PMU for effective coordination and decision making, such as identification of priority needs for allocation of
‘Flexible Funds’.
 EQ6: To what extent and how has the SoP ECW/MYRP contributed directly &/or indirectly to mobilizing and leveraging
funds at country level? How can the MYRPs be strengthened in this regard?
It does not appear that additional international or national resources were mobilised in support of the broader MYRP,
nor does it appear that seed funds contributed toward generation of additional funds earmqarked for MYRP
implementation. In fact, the opposite appears to be the case in SoP: seed funds largely contributed toward other
programmes, priorities, and activities defined by the implementing partners operating in their siloes. This challenge
has been described at length in other sections of the report; it does appear that this inversion of mobilisation (i.e., that
| iv |
seed funds were mobilised to other strategies and priorities, rather than vice versa) resulted in the dilution of
perceivable or discernible impact arising from ECW's support. Including strategic stakeholders (such as donors, multi-
lateral agencies, and other resource arrangements such as JFA and the GPE) in the Steering Committee to monitor
‘resource mobilisation’ as one of the KPIs of MYRP requires significant restructuring of governance arrangements.
The current governance arrangement face potential conflicts of interest, and are overly narrow in scope and remit.
EQ7: To what extent and how did the SoP ECW/MYRP promote and strengthen a joint, (humanitarian-development)

coordinated, evidence-based, and inclusive approach to EiEPC programming in the State of Palestine? How can
these aspects be strengthened in MYRP?
The MYRP appears to have contributed to the strengthening of existing relationships between various partners and
stakeholders across SoP through the implementation of joint programming, though there were challenges in the
collection and analysis of evidence and data, and related response. Establishment of key units (like the PMU), and
strengthening of existing coordination entities were also highlighted as key, positive outcomes arising from this seed
fund. Since new strategies are due to be developed in the following months, the PMU could serve a coordinating role
to ensure alignment of plans/programmes, including the new ESSP and MYRP, and resources from donors such as
ECW, GPE, JFA, the WB, USAID etc.
EQ8: To what extent and how did the SoP ECW/MYRP strengthen country and local capacities at individual,

organizational and institutional levels for improved EiEPC programming? How can the MYRPs be strengthened in this
regard?
There were a variety of trainings provided to local authorities, which many cited as contributing directly to improved
capacities at the national and local level; furthermore, many of the downstream partners for MYRP implementation
were national and local in nature. However, once again, due to the high level of fragmentation of support, limited
documentary evidence on outcomes and impact, and turnover of local authorities, it is a substantial challenge to point
directly to the MYRP’s impact on capacity, both across national and international partners. Furthermore, it is not
possible to establish whether training leads to capacity building and learning outcomes without a structured, evidence-
and measurement-based approach, such as pre- and post-training assessment and/or training impact assessment.
Additionally, capacity improvement and systems strengthening did not form part of Results Framework (RF) as
intermediate outcomes/results contributing to the overall outcomes/results. As such, there is a lack of evidence to
measure and attribute the impact of training/capacity building/system strengthening inputs.
EQ9: To what extent and how did the SoP ECW/MYRP promote and strengthen: (i) the availability of quality data on

education needs/gaps in SoP, and (ii) the measurement of output and outcome results? How can the MYRPs be
strengthened in this regard?
This was one of the primary deficiencies of the programme highlighted both by investigation and by key informants.
Limited evidence and data was generated, and no evidence on outcomes provided; all evidence generated was on
an output basis, and this appeared to be inconsistent and unstructured, with most of it provided in laconic narrative
reports and none of it independently verifiable. Lack of a unified MEAL Framework and Plan is an important gap, which
originates from the fragmentation and projectisation of MYRP.
EQ10: What is the progress made towards the different collective beneficiary results as identified in the country result

frameworks (access, continuity, equity and gender equality, quality and learning, safety)? How can the MYRP be
strengthened in this regard?
Once again, results beyond outputs were a substantial challenge to establish, given (once again) the high degree of
fragmentation of support, as well as the limited documentary evidence on outcomes collected in the course of the
programme.
 EQ11: How is the SoP ECW/MYRP promoting and strengthening sustainable and resilient education systems and
solutions so far? How can it be strengthened in this regard?
It has been very difficult to determine the specific impact of the programme, not least in terms of its impact on resilience
to crisis or conflict (which is already a very subtle, and difficult to define area). Integration in other larger responses
and actions by the high quantity of implementing partners, and resulting difficulty in discerning unique or differentiable
impact, have much to do with this. Similarly, the way in which the programme and its linked activities were intended
to improve conflict resilience do not appear to have been well defined from the outset, making it even harder to
comment concretely on this research question. Nuanced conflict analysis, vulnerability analysis, and factoring in
resilience within the MYRP design and establishing indicator/s for measuring resilience could be considered for next
generation of MYRP.
| v |
 EQ12: To what extent have cross-cutting themes such as gender, age, disability, vulnerability, child and
human rights, and accountability been integrated in the programme?
Crosscutting themes (including all of those mentioned) do appear to have broadly informed implementation of the
MYRP, with nearly all stakeholders praising this aspect of programming; however, the degree to which this was
intentional (rather than an incidental) effect of integration in other, established programmes led by experienced UN
and international partners remained unclear, especially in light of the high degree of fragmentation mentioned in the
findings section of this document. Feedback from stakeholders suggests that programme design was undermined by
a lack of the use of specific tools or programming frameworks (e.g. GEDSI, etc.).
Recommendations
The MYRP faced similar challenges across the ECW portfolio; their recent shift has resulted from their learnings in the past
(many of which reflect those from the SoP MYRP): smaller but targeted beneficiary scale, offering holistic support to smaller
numbers of children impacted by emergency and/or crisis; work on ensuring ECW's 'value-add’ (i.e. in legitimate emergency
response and/or crisis programming vs complement to development-focussed programming like GPE ESPIGs); minimising the
number of partners involved; strengthening MEAL and developing a standardised MYRP level MEAL plan to ensure that
reporting is consistent, up-to-date, and includes metrics of outcome in learning, access, and equity.
In line with the findings and conclusions of the evaluation, the following are presented as the key recommendations for future
development and implementation of MYRPs within the Palestinian context:
Recommendation 1: Design Strengthening
Adopt a targeted, strategic and crisis-focused approach, built on concrete evidence and a data-driven basis, ensuring
that resilience is clearly defined, and informed by a robust multi-dimensional barrier analysis addressing the needs of
vulnerable groups.
Recommendation 2: Effective MYRP Delivery
Ensure that interventions are communicated effectively to beneficiary communities, and streamline partnership
arrangement based on VfM, localisation of aid, and AAP principles and commitment, selecting implementing partners
through open and competitive bidding process.
Recommendation 3: Sector-wide Alignment
Develop a digital and centralised platform for tracking resource mobilisation and alignment, in which nexus-focussed
activities are defined, specifying how they can add value.
Recommendation 4: Effective Coordination and Resource Mobilization
Clearly and realistically define the scale and types of additional resources to be leveraged and how the MYRP can do
so, while aligning future programming with other funding sources and mechanisms and ensuring that economies of
scale are achieved where possible.
Recommendation 5: Strengthening Governance of MYRP
Ensure government roles and responsibilities are clearly/well integrated from the outset of the programme, avoiding
potential conflict of interests, and that the government has a leading role in leadership and oversight of programming,
while building on PMU successes and capacity.
Recommendation 6: Robust monitoring, impact measurement and accountability of MYRP
Partners should be actively encouraged to report on outcomes, and link programming to impact, maintaining (and
sharing) quantitative data on clear and measurable outcomes, and ensuring output data is systematically collected and
independently verifiable.

Chapter 1: Context and Description of the
Object of the Evaluation1
1.1 Intervention Context
The Education Cannot Wait (ECW) facilitated Multi Year Resilience Programme (MYRP) was implemented in the State of
Palestine (SoP) between June 2019 and December 2022. The following sub-sections provide contextual information for the
intervention.
1.1.1 Context Figure 1: UN OCHA State of Palestine Map2
The State of Palestine is located in Western Asia,
bordering the Mediterranean Sea, Egypt, Israel,
and Jordan. The total population of the State of
Palestine in 2023 is estimated to be 5,483,450
people (Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics,
2021). As of 2021, the country’s GDP was
US$18.04 Billion, with a per capita GDP of
US$3,052.6 (The World Bank, 2021). The State of
Palestine is currently recognized by 138 of 193
United Nations (UN) member states. The
humanitarian situation in Palestine is among the
world’s most long-standing protection crises.
Hebron is the largest Governorate in the West Bank
in terms of area (997 km2), population (729,139 -
approximately 23% of the West Bank population),
and economic activity (17,661 active businesses,
comprising 18% of the West Bank’s total). In
contrast, Hebron also has the highest poverty rate
in the West Bank (not including refugee camps) with
32.5% of its population classified as poor compared
to an average of 18%, with 22% of HHs either
severely or moderately food insecure, compared to

the West Bank average of 16%. The Governorate
HTTPS://WWW.OCHAOPT.ORG/MAPS
has been divided into Areas A, B and C since the
Oslo accords of 1995. Approximately 67,850 Palestinians (11% of Hebron governorate population) live in Area C of Hebron,
which also includes 51.1% of the agricultural land.
Over 60% of the West Bank is classified as Area C. Area C is the only contiguous area in the West Bank and contains the bulk
of Palestinian agricultural and grazing land, as well as land reserves and resources that are essential for Palestinian growth and
development. According to OCHA, an estimated 297,900 people live in 532 residential areas in Area C, comprising some of
the most vulnerable communities in the West Bank in terms of humanitarian needs.
The total Palestinian population in Jerusalem stands at around 323,700, 76% of whom live under the poverty line including 83.4%
of children.
1.9 million Palestinians live in Gaza, of which 1.3 million people are registered refugees with UNRWA. Gazans face a
socioeconomic crisis that puts them in a state of de-development. The socioeconomic conditions in Gaza are characterized by
a high unemployment rate of 53.7 percent (41.1 percent for men and 71.5 percent for women). In addition to the high

unemployment and gloomy economic outlook, conditions in Gaza are worsened by electricity cuts of between 16-20 hours/day,
and reduced access to clean water.
1.1.2 Sectoral Context / Policy Framework
The Palestinian education system is comprised of pre-school education, basic education, secondary education, and non-formal
education. Pre-school education consists of two years and is not compulsory. Pre-school education is primarily delivered by for-
profit or non-profit private providers. Basic education includes grades 1-9 and consists of two levels: preparatory stage (1st-4th
grades) and empowerment stage (5th-10th grades). Basic education is compulsory and provided by three types of schools: (1)
public schools managed by the MOEHE; (2) schools managed by UNRWA; and (3) private schools managed by for-profit and
non-profit entities which are registered with and monitored by the MOEHE. Secondary education includes academic and
vocation education for 10-12 grades and is provided by public schools managed by the MOEHE, as well as private schools
managed by forprofit and non-profit entities which are registered with and monitored by the MOEHE. Finally, non-formal
education (NFE) consists of parallel education programs and literacy programs provided in non-formal education centres run
by the MOEHE or in vocational training centres run by the Ministry of Social Development (MoSD), the Ministry of Social Affairs
(MoSA), the Ministry of Labour (MoL), UNRWA, or for-profit and non-profit nongovernmental actors.
The State of Palestine Child Law and new Basic Education Law guarantee every child the right to free education until the
completion of secondary school. However, the protracted conflict and violent episodes of escalation in the West Bank, including
East Jerusalem, the closure of the Gaza Strip, and physical access restrictions, have had a substantial impact on children in the
region, posing significant challenges to the fulfilment of their rights.
Children aged 0 to 17 years represent 43.5 percent (2,115,317) of the population, of which 1,083,720 are boys and 1,031,650
are girls. There are approximately 1.3 million children enrolled in 2,963 primary and secondary schools in the State of Palestine
(2,249 schools in the West Bank and 714 in the Gaza Strip). Out of those, 319,188 children attend 370 UNRWA schools, whilst
the remainder attend 2,203 government or 420 private schools.
Almost half a million children need humanitarian assistance to access quality education. Both girls and boys face obstacles to
access education and at times cannot participate regularly in learning activities due to restrictions in movement, distance from
school, military check points, harassment and sometimes violence by civilians, arbitrary detention, limited or debilitated school
infrastructure, and lack of classroom space and materials. In addition to the education-related obstacles, these same
communities experience the highest levels of poverty, unemployment and limited access to services and resources, and are
isolated in a manner that increases traditional practices such as child marriage that has a negative impact, especially on girls.
Moreover, due to the shortage of adequate infrastructure in the Gaza Strip, around 65 per cent of schools operate on a double-
shift system, resulting in reduced hours in core subjects and foundation learning. Children’s ability to access education, both at
school and at home, is also undermined by the Gaza Strip’s chronic electricity and internet deficit. These challenges have been
significantly compounded by the outbreak of the COVID- 19, which has led to the prolonged closures of schools and
kindergartens as part of the measures to contain the pandemic. Adding to this, the political unrest that escalated in the 2nd
quarter of 2021 resulted in some children being killed and others injured, school infrastructure damaged, students in the Gaza
Strip suffering learning loss, in addition to the psychosocial consequences as a result of the conflict, where girls and boys suffer
trauma and experience developmental challenges which, if left unaddressed, will negatively impact their educational attainment.
For students with disabilities, prolonged hospitalized children, ex-detainee children and children under home arrest, such
negative consequences are compounded by their need for assistive devices and/or customized learning support that are largely
unavailable due to financial constraints and a shortage of properly trained teachers. The cumulative result is a significant student
population that is vulnerable, out-of-school, without psychosocial support and specific skills relevant for their educational and
developmental needs.
The overarching framework for humanitarian and development education interventions in the State of Palestine is the
government’s Education Sector Strategic Plan (ESSP) 2017-2022. In addition, three other strategies/plans define the
government and partners’ interventions aimed at ensuring access and completion of quality education for children affected by
the humanitarian situation. They are:
▪ The Joint Advocacy and Protection Strategy;
▪ The UNRWA Mid-Term Strategy (including its EiE programme); and
▪ The Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP).
Three goals drove the ESSP and its seven programmes (pre-school, basic, secondary; TVET, higher and non-formal education;
and management and administration):
| 2 |
1/ Ensuring safe, inclusive, and equitable access to quality education at all levels of the system and this goal also stresses
the need for inclusion and equality at all educational levels, especially for children with disabilities
2/ Developing a student-centered teaching and learning pedagogy and environment, which aims to ensure quality
education, improve educational outcomes, promote inputs and processes, evaluate outcomes and set forth progress
measuring mechanisms. The goal is to develop in students the skills and values holistically
3/ Enhance Accountability and Results-Based Leadership, Governance and Management, which seeks to strengthen
MOEHE monitoring and organizational role in the educational sector by institutionalizing the educational strategic
planning process; putting in place necessary legislations for the education sector’s management and development;
ensuring proper application of the national educational plans and policies, promotion of results and accountability and
development of financial management.
The ESSP mainstreamed the education in emergency throughout all its interventions calling for:
▪ All sectoral policies and plans and budget-planning processes to involve (1) risk assessment; (2) preparedness and
response to emergency in education; (3) initiatives that meet the needs of children, youth and adults affected by
situations of disaster, conflict, displacement and epidemics; and (4) support for sub-regional and regional mechanisms
and strategies to respond to the educational needs of the displaced persons and refugees.
▪ Approval of a comprehensive methodology to enable schools to survive disasters and emergencies, regardless of their
degree; and
▪ Enactment of policies and strategies to protect learners, teachers and other staff against violence, as part of violence-
free schools in armed conflict areas; commitment to and abiding by international humanitarian law to protect schools
and civil facilities; and prosecution of those responsible for violating this law as part of the efforts to achieve the
educational goals by 2030.
In an effort to streamline EiE and humanitarian response into its sector plans and strategies, in 2016 the MOEHE developed the
Joint Advocacy and Protection Strategy (JPAS). The strategy was the integral part of then Education Development Strategic
Plan III (2014-2019) which has since been updated into ESSP. The strategy aimed to contribute to the Ministry’s ongoing efforts
to: a) assume more ownership and leadership over the public education sector, and: b) deepen the alignment and harmonisation
among all players (development and humanitarian) as part of the Sector Wide Approach (SWAP). The strategy identified nine
key areas of interventions including Advocacy and External Communications; Protective Presence; School Transportation; PSS;
Monitoring and Accountability; Legal Support; Crisis-Disaster Risk Reduction at the school level; Protective Infrastructure and
Remedial Education of Injured/Imprisoned Students.
As part of its Medium-Term Strategy (MTS) 2016-21 and under its Strategic Outcome Three for Education, UNRWA articulated
its commitment to ensuring that Palestine Refugee School-aged Children Complete Quality, Equitable and Inclusive Basic
Education. This Strategic Outcome builded on the achievements to date of the UNRWA Education Reform (2011-2016) focusing
on embedding, enriching and sustaining these achievements. Through the Reform, UNRWA developed key policies, strategies,
and professional development programmes across the substantive education programme areas: teacher development, student
assessment, human rights education, and inclusive education. The Reform has already shown impact at all levels with teaching
and learning practices changing in classrooms and children achieving more and dropping out less. To strengthen the monitoring
and evaluation system, UNRWA gathers both quantitative and qualitative data systematically to enable comparison and target
setting; these indicators are part of the Common Monitoring Framework of the MTS. UNRWA has developed also an Education
in Emergencies (EiE) programme which builds on its existing MTS education priorities as well as introduced innovative
approaches to address the needs in emergencies such as the UNRWA Self-Learning Programme, additional psychosocial
support, safety and security in schools, and strengthened community engagement in EiE.
Finally, the Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) 2019 focused the response on the immediate and critical education needs of
the most vulnerable populations. Protection was at the heart of the strategies and activities that were implemented by Palestine
humanitarian community, encompassing responsive actions, remedial actions and environment-building or other actions that
address the drivers of protracted humanitarian needs. The multi-year strategy incorporated the centrality of protection as an
integral part of all humanitarian strategies and activities implemented in Palestine. The geographical parameters for humanitarian
response in 2019 include Area C, East Jerusalem and H2/Hebron. The humanitarian community was’ also asked to prioritize its
response in order to target the most vulnerable people in need, in accordance with available humanitarian capacities.

1.2 Programme Overview (Object of Evaluation)
1.2.1 Programme Overview
The ECW Global fund was established during the World Humanitarian Summit in 2016 to help reposition education as a priority
on the humanitarian agenda, usher in a more collaborative approach among actors on the ground and foster additional funding
to ensure that every crisis-affected child and young person is in education and learning. ECW is committed to supporting the
delivery of inclusive and quality education to 8.9 million girls, boys, and youth most affected by emergencies and protracted
crises by 2021. Working along the humanitarian – development nexus (HDN), ECW sought not just to meet education needs,
but to reduce risk and vulnerability to realize the common vision of a future in which no one is left behind.
Aligned to the global ECW, the SoP ECW/MYRP (2019-2022) was a vision for the education sector supported by the ECW seed
fund ($18 million in total); this funding kicked off the start of the MYRP, from where onwards new resources were meant to be
mobilized to fund the total MYRP budget envelope of $34 million, to allow for scale-up and expansion to pre-identified
schools/learning centers and thereby reaching more crisis-affected children. The SoP ECW/MYRP sought to see where it can
harmonize among the three existing national education plans and strategies under one coherent framework connecting the
humanitarian and development (HD) fields of interventions in education:
▪ the Education Sector Strategic Plan 2017 – 2022 (ESSP);
▪ the Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP); and
▪ the UNRWA Mid-Term Strategy (with its Education in Emergencies components).
This overarching framework addresses the diffusion of education interventions and ensures that education priorities remain
streamlined and focused, reinforcing linkages between emergency and development strategies. Moreover, it complements
current interventions and resource streams and focuses on filling identified gaps through the provision of evidence-based and
innovative interventions to support the learning needs of this targeted population.
1.2.2 Programme Goals / Objectives
The programme aimed at ensuring that crisis-affected vulnerable and marginalized girls and boys (6-17 years) have sustained
and safe access to improved quality and relevance of education in inclusive and protective environments.
The programme sought to achieve this through three outcomes:
Outcome 1 Improved, sustained and safe equitable, inclusive and gender-responsive access to education and
learning opportunities for crisis-affected vulnerable and marginalized girls and boys (6-17 years old)
Outcome 2 Improved quality and relevance of education for crisis-affected vulnerable and marginalized girls and boys
(6-17 years old) in inclusive and protective environments
Outcome 3 Strengthened capacity of the education system to respond to chronic humanitarian needs and to deliver
a coordinated and mainstreamed response
The Programme Log-Frame, detailing the outputs and activities for each outcome, can be found in Annexure 14.
1.2.3 Programme Strategies
By effectively bridging the humanitarian-development divide, the strategic intention of the SoP ECW/MYRP was to catalyse
innovative approaches combined with evidence-based interventions to meet the needs of conflict-affected children and youth
in the said targeted areas of the SoP and to strengthen the education system to manage and coordinate protracted conflicts
and crises. The strategy sought to specifically increase access and continuity of relevant education for conflict-affected girls
and boys through interventions that promote protection, inclusion, equity, and quality of education as outlined below. This
section details the programme strategy through highlighting both its collective beneficiary and systematic outcomes.
Beneficiary Collective Outcomes:
▪ Access and Continuity of Education: The SoP ECW/MYRP aimed to improve access and continuity of education to the
most vulnerable children in targeted areas (Relevant activities implemented by UNICEF, UNESCO, UNDP, UNRWA,
and SCI)
▪ Protective Environment: The SoP ECW/MYRP was envisioned to improve the protection of the learning environment for
girls and boys in the SoP targeted areas that are characterised by protracted armed conflict, recurrent disasters, and
impoverishment. (Relevant activities implemented by UNICEF, UNESCO, UNRWA, and SCI)
▪ Inclusion and Equity were promoted through the SoP ECW/MYRP for the most marginalised target groups. The MYRP
aimed to improve enrolment and prevent drop out of children and children with disability living in Area C, East Jerusalem,
| 4 |
and Hebron H2, and schools at particular risk of military presence. (Relevant activities implemented by UNICEF,
UNESCO, UNDP, UNRWA, and SCI)
▪ Quality Education and Learning: The SoP ECW/MYRP aimed to contribute to strengthening the integration of life skills
and inclusive education into the teaching and learning practices. (Relevant activities implemented by UNICEF, UNESCO,
UNRWA, and SCI)
Systematic Outcomes (Relevant activities implemented by UNICEF, UNESCO, UNDP, and SCI):
▪ Strengthened national and local capacities: The SoP ECW/MYRP aimed to contribute to strengthening the capacity of
the education system to respond to shocks and sustain inclusive quality provision of education during and after
emergencies both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The programme focused on the MoE capacity to coordinate
response through robust internal contingency planning at Directorate and school levels as well as through close
coordination with EiE Working Group partners.
▪ Strengthened policies and domestic leadership: As pointed earlier, the SoP ECW/MYRP was closely aligned to key
national and international plans and strategies in education and brought together these strategies under the overarching
MYRP coherent framework, bridging the gap between the humanitarian and development work.
▪ Increased, more timely and predictable funding: The SoP ECW/MYRP was designed to serve an advocacy, financing,
and resource mobilization role in the State of Palestine. The SoP ECW/MYRP seed funding over three years kicked off
the start of the MYRP, from where onwards new resources were to be mobilized to fund the total MYRP budget envelope.
▪ Strengthened joint planning and coordination: The SoP ECW/MYRP adopted a context-specific approach to education
that positioned the MYRP strategically within the HDN.
▪ Increased availability of quality data, evidence, and research: The SoP ECW/MYRP through joint efforts of its partners
and the MoE led several initiatives to increase availability of quality evidence-based data.
In brief, SoP ECW/MYRP promoted a multi-sectoral "whole-child approach” that responds to the diverse needs that children and
youth affected by conflict and crisis face. The strategies followed and the support packages responded to both physical and
mental health needs of teachers, children, and their caregivers. This was complemented with other educational needs which
include support to teachers and pedagogy, school leadership, community engagement, organization and system strengthening
aspects.
1.2.4 Programme Timeline and Geographic Spread
The MYRP for the State of Palestine was implemented between June 2019 and December 2023. Two reprogramming exercises
were undertaken due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020 and 2021, and to the Escalation in the Gaza Strip in 2021, which
resulted in revision in programming pathways, delivery modality and workplan, including interventions.
The programme had a national geographic scope of work, focusing on the most marginalized population groups that are most
affected by the conflict, with emphasis on the targeted areas/schools across Area C, H2 Hebron, East Jerusalem and the Gaza
Strip, as per the MYRP programme document and MoE priorities.
1.2.5 Programme Stakeholders and their Role
The five bodies of the State of Palestine ECW/MYRP governance structure are presented in the table below:

1.3 Preliminary Understanding around Integration of Human Rights, Gender
Equality and Equity Principles
In line with a Human Rights-Based Approach to programming, the SoP MYRP sought to promote inclusion and equity for the
most vulnerable and marginalised target groups. The MYRP aimed to improve enrolment and prevent drop out of Bedouin and
herder communities living in Area C, students in East Jerusalem and Hebron H2 residents and schools at particular risk of
military presence and entry (predominantly boys’ schools), and children with disabilities. Through its transportation and
infrastructure improvement interventions, the programme was also designed to target adolescents’ girls in the Bedouin and
herder communities, whose access to education is especially at risk due to unavailability of schools and/or long unsafe
commutes. Through its protective presence interventions, the programme was also designed to target children and adolescents
(boys and girls), who may be at higher risk of harassment and arbitrary searches at checkpoint crossings.
The focus on life skills education and citizenship education was also aimed at empowerment of girls who, in the Palestinian
context, tend to have higher learning achievement and completion rates than boys, yet rarely emerge as leaders or decision-
makers in the society and are seldom entrusted with managerial or business matters. Life skills education programmes that are
part of the MYRP were aimed at developing in girls not only the skills for learning, but for personal empowerment, active
citizenship and employability. In that regard, the programme aimed to strengthen girls’ empowerment so they can become
active future economic and social actors in their communities.
The programme was also designed to address the needs of girls and boys with disabilities through specific interventions that
sought to provide assistive devices as well as comprehensive teacher training on inclusive education in government and UNRWA
schools to ensure that their learning needs are adequately addressed, and they have access to safe and enabling learning
environment.
1.4 Programme Theory of Change (ToC)
At the highest level, the Theory of Change (ToC) reflects and responds to the rights of all children to have access to basic
education as enshrined in the 1960 UNESCO Convention against Discrimination in Education; 1989 UN Convention of the Right
of the Child (CRC), ratified by the SoP; the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 4 (Quality Education), 5 (Gender Equality)
and 10 (Reduced Inequalities) and to the rights of all children to a safe education as enshrined in Safe School Declaration 2015.
The ToC is a tool for planning, management, and M&E, that was reviewed through this consultancy in preparation for and to
inform the design of future SoP ECW/MYRPs.
Below is the TOC for the SOP MYRP, as laid out in initial programme documents and plans:

Review of the Theory of Change, in light of the results of the programme, can allow for several conclusions. First, that the logic
chain does, generally, appear to be sound at a broad, theoretical level; however, it does not appear to align directly to the
activities undertaken, nor to the specific/varied objectives of the myriad partners involved in programme design and
implementation. That is to say that it appeas the TOC was developed prior to the baseline or the design of specific activities for
implementation, and consequently seems to be a generic education-focussed TOC, rather than one that really guided
programme design, implementation, programme oversight/management, or evaluation. As such, while the logic chain is sound,
it doesn’t appear to be 100% relevant to the programme as finally implemented, beyond the fact that the designed TOC could
be seen to be broadly relevant to a wide array of internationally-funded education programming in SoP.
Starting at the assumptions level, the assumptions do, broadly, appear to be accurate; however, it does not appear that any
work was undertaken in the course of design and implementation to mitigate or address assumptions, and the potential
challenges to which they referred. This can be seen to arise from challenges highlighted in other parts of this evaluation, namely
those addressing the fact that much activity was integrated into other programming by a large number of other partners, and
consequently the high degree of fragmentation of support means little effort was undertaken to address or mitigate the issues
identified in the assumptions of the TOC of the MYRP.
Furthermore, the provided list of assumptions was not comprehensive; several key assumptions appear to have been missing
from this Theory of Change; assumptions which, if appropriately considered and addressed, would likely have fundamentally
changed the approach implemented in this MYRP:
▪ The highly atomised approach to provision of support would be sufficient to achieve desired impacts.
▪ The resources dedicated to each individual beneficiary supported would be sufficient to achieve the desired impacts.
▪ Leaving partners largely to their own devices to implement activities they wanted, with limited oversight and coordination,
would be sufficient to achieve desired impacts.
▪ Reliance on government to select the target schools, rather than undertaking much more specific targeting activities
seeking to ensure the most vulnerable receive support, would be well aligned to the given objectives.
These assumptions are the most substantive that do not seem to have been identified or appropriately addressed during
planning and implementation of this MYRP.
Consequently, looking at each component of the logic chain individually, a number of challenges can be observed:
| 9 |

IF: students can safely and regularly access quality and appropriately equipped learning spaces
The degree to which MYRP supports substantively contributed, through its highly fragmented approach, to the ability
of students to access quality and appropriately equipped learning spaces was unclear. Once again, the fragmentation
of support (rather than the more holistic approaches encouraged by ECW in more recent years) means that individual
student learning spaces still may not have been of the required quality and resourcing. Furthermore, the focus on
materials and infrastructure does not have strong evidentiary linkages to improved learning outcomes, with a number
of studies in recent years calling into question the usefulness of material and infrastructure investments (all of which
are more impressive to look at, and easier to implement) with regard to improved learning and development of pupils.

IF: teachers and schools are enabled to provide relevant quality education support and inclusivity including life skills and PSS
Once again, the highly fragmented support, short duration of training, and lack of clarity surrounding the content and
effectiveness of training approaches used makes it challenging to assess whether this condition was, indeed,
achieved, and even if it was, whether provided trainings would have achieved the desired outcomes.
 IF: the MoE can coordinate and manage the identifying, tracking and supporting of these students through strengthened systems
and response mechanisms during crises and emergencies
The degree of coordination and management of the MOE, throughout the MYRP, appeared to be uneven and of
unclear impact. Individual students do not appear to have been targeted, tracked, or emphasised, preferring instead
to rely heavily on refurbishment or material supports (in the wide majority of cases), resulting in unclear impacts by
the end of the programme.
As such, even at the very high level of this TOC, it does not appear that the necessary conditions have clearly been achieved,
and the resulting outcome highlighted by the TOC may not have resulted from the programme’s activities.
Future programmes should take efforts to ensure that any TOC is linked to measured needs, that key assumptions are
comprehensive and fully addressed, and that all conditions, outcomes, and outputs are well thought out, relevant to the designed
programme, and allow for the identification and resolution of holistic needs of the most vulnerable children.

Chapter 2: Evaluation, Purpose, Objectives,
Scope, and Questions
2.1 Final ECW Evaluation Purpose
The purpose of the external evaluation of the 2019-2022 SoP ECW/MYRP was to learn and assess the programme's results and
provide recommendations to improve any future MYRP in the country in terms of its design and implementation modality.
2.2 Final ECW Evaluation Objectives
The objectives which informed the fulfilment of the evaluation purpose are as follows:
Objective A Evaluate the development process, design, and implementation context and approaches of the SoP
ECW/MYRP, its alignment with the SoP ECW/MYRP ToC and ECW’s role and support towards this.
Objective B Evaluate and measure the systemic and collective beneficiary results of the SoP ECW/MYRP, with specific
attention on whether ECW and its partners are fulfilling their expected roles and responsibilities efficiently,
effectively, and collaboratively.
Objective C Based on the findings, provide lessons learned and recommendations to inform and improve future SoP
ECW/MYRP in-country processes, design, and implementation approaches.
Geographically, the evaluation focused on the targeted areas/schools across Area C, H2 Hebron, East Jerusalem and the Gaza
Strip.
2.3 Final ECW Evaluation Scope
The evaluation focused on the SoP ECW/MYRP (2019-2022) and its activities as part of the MYRP modality.
The evaluation paid attention to a core element of the SoP ECW/MYRP, related to bridging the development-humanitarian nexus
(HDN). The SoP ECW/MYRP aimed to bring together all relevant parties amidst a crisis to join forces, secure political support,
mobilise resources and implement the MYRP. By bringing together these actors, the programme intended to facilitate joined
programming and thereby respond to systemic education needs in the medium and longer term. The extent to which the SoP
ECW/MYRP was able to bring the HD actors together and jointly work towards collective beneficiary results is an area that
required specific analysis. The evaluation team investigated the SoP ECW/MYRP contribution to bridging the HDN thoroughly,
aiming to provide important learning for programming on the HDN, document the lessons learnt, best practices and challenges
on how HDN programming will contribute to the eventual formulation of collective outcomes.
The SoP ECW/MYRP initial investment was also evaluated against its beneficiary results. The evaluation team collected new
data and also incorporated all related data, information, and documentation available. Applying a gender, equity and human
rights lens, the evaluation covered all targeted groups by the MYRP (direct and indirect beneficiaries) including students,
teachers, counsellors, caregivers, school principals, school emergency committees, MYRP grantees/partners, MoE staff,
IPs/NGOs, donors and other relevant stakeholders.
The evaluation examined the programming strategies and their connectedness, the results, risks, and financial frameworks and
implementation approach, the quality of the SoP ECW/MYRP systemic outcomes and to what extent it affected the development
process, design, implementation approaches, and the collective beneficiaries’ outcomes of the SoP ECW/MYRP and the ToC.
It also evaluated to what extent the ECW’s role (governance structure including its different bodies/actors’ division &/or roles
and responsibilities) was coherent, effective, and efficient (i.e., fit for purpose/support towards this). Further, it evaluated the
extent to which these outcomes served the HDN and “whole of a system” uptake/approach for the benefit of the most
marginalized SoP children, the extent to which the SoP ECW/MYRP was flexible/shock responsive in its programming, the extent
to which it was efficient and effective in developing partnerships and accountabilities, and the extent to which gender, disability
and humanitarian principles were taken into consideration in the programme design and implementation. Moreover, given that
the SoP ECW/MYRP was designed to serve both an advocacy, financing, and resource mobilization role for SoP being an EiE
affected country, the evaluation examined the extent to which the SoP ECW/MYRP was efficient and effective in addressing
quality and financing challenges for education that persist in the short-term humanitarian and long-term development
investments, and if, no in-country resources were mobilized, why and how this could be improved.
| 11 |
The evaluation also sought to understand the achievement of the programme activities, broken down into the modalities included
in the Initial Terms of Reference, and informing the proposed approach. The following table demonstrates a breakdown of the
modalities, organisations involved and a brief description of these. The extra modalities added by UNICEF SoP were Computer
Labs, STEM and HR Systems in the West Bank. This reflects some disparities between implementation, and the Terms of
Reference, and a request by UNICEF SoP that additional modalities (arising from ‘pivoted’ reprogramming) be addressed.
Separately, activities for ‘Cleaning materials for grade 12 students’ and the Gaza Strip ‘Back to school’ provision was split into
two modalities for sampling purposes. This was discussed with UNICEF SoP to ensure that those in recipient institutions of the
cleaning materials in West Bank and recipients of the ‘Back to School’ programme in the Gaza Strip were appropriately covered
in the sampling and evaluation.

2.4 Final ECW Evaluation Criteria and Questions
In guidance for the adequate achievement of the evaluation objectives, a series of research questions and supporting sub-
questions (available in Annexure 2) have informed the design of research instruments and aligned data collection efficiently
with intended evaluation outcomes. These are broken down by a combination of development and humanitarian action
programmes’ criteria set by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) - Development Assistance
Committee (DAC) and Active Learning Network for Accountability and Performance (ALNAP)5 that are relevant to the MYRP
modality.
2.5 Stakeholders, Interests and Uses of the Final ECW Evaluation
The primary users of the evaluation are the five MYRP partners (UNICEF SoP, UNESCO, UNDP, UNRWA, and Save the
Children), the donor community, specifically ECW, and the MoE. In addition, the other secondary audiences and users of the
evaluation report, and who are not directly involved or concerned with this evaluation, will be e.g. the MYRP sub-grantee
implementing partners, Education Cluster partners, the Education Sector Working Group (ESWG) members, education NGOs,
and universities involved in education.
2.6 Significance of Evaluation
The evaluation is particularly significant for two main reasons: on one level, it is the first external, independent, and systematic
assessment of the project as a whole. In this sense, the evaluation thoroughly analyses the project’s achievements and
challenges and provides a crucial first attempt at taking stock of good practices and lessons learned. On a broader level, the
evaluation constitutes the first review of a project of this kind in the Gaza Strip. By combining development and humanitarian
4 This activity was added at the request of UNESCO, following completion of data collection activities, and was therefore not addressed in primary data collection. A brief
evaluation document has been shared in relation to this activity, which is appended to the report as Annex 11. It comprised: Inclusive Education Teacher Training, and Inclusive
Education Policy Development; Training of 72 teachers in inclusive education; Provision of supporting manuals and teaching guides; and Support to the MOE for revision and
completion of the Inclusive Education Policy.

approaches, the project can be considered as a proof of concept for the Nexus approach in a very peculiar context. In this line,
the evaluation provides important elements for assessing and designing similar approaches, promoting systemic change in
complicated, protracted crises.
| 13 |
Chapter 3: Final Evaluation Methodology,
Quality Assurance and Ethics
3.1 Research Conceptual Framework and Design
To achieve this consultancy’s objectives as described above, the evaluation employed a mixed methods approach which
collects both qualitative and quantitative data, combining surveys, key informant interviews (KIIs), focus group discussions
(FGDs) and review and analysis of existing quantitative and qualitative secondary data. This approach supports effective data
collection on both easily measurable outcomes and impacts as well as in abstract investigation of beliefs and attitudes. A further
advantage of the mixed methods approach is that quantitative data is often most useful for understanding ‘what’, while qualitative
data often provides a more detailed and nuanced understanding of ‘how and why’ (Denscombe, 2010); these two levels of
analysis provide a rigorous combination of descriptive and explanatory power. Further information can be found in Annexures 2
and 3.
3.2 Research Methods
The following data collection tools were developed and deployed by the consultancy team: Portfolio Review (see Annexure 4 for
a list of documents reviewed); MYRP Beneficiary Survey; MYRP Beneficiary FGD; Teacher Training and Recruitment Survey;
Implementing Staff (Teacher) KIIs; Client and Stakeholder KIIs. For further information, please see Annexure 3. Copies of the
tools are included in Annexure 8.
3.3 Quantitative Methods
3.3.1 Target Population
The target population for quantitative methods included pupils and teachers who were ECW/MYRP beneficiaries.
3.3.2 Calculating Sample Size
Sample targets were developed to ensure that, where possible, they are representative of both geographies of focus, i.e. the
West Bank, and the Gaza Strip, while working within the constraints of the resources and timeframe available. The ToR
suggested that all schools in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip were recipient of support under all the modalities – this was not
the case - the sample was thus adapted to reflect those locations which received either modality, or both modalities. The
respondents were selected on the following basis:
Tool Selection Criteria Total Sample

repeated interview requests.
It should be emphasised that primary data served to triangulate the findings of broader analysis of project data, and other
secondary data shared by partners, or available in the public domain. Further details on sampling can be found in Annexure 9.
3.3.5 Level of Retrospectivity
The present study is entirely retrospective, with all individuals sampled asked to recall information about events and support
received in the past as part of the ECW/MYRP during data collection.
3.3.6 Pilot
The tools were piloted during enumerator training, which took place virtually to accommodate for both West Bank and the Gaza
Strip teams.
3.3.7 Quality Control Procedures
All data was collected on tablets and smartphone, and uploaded in real-time to Thuso’s cloud-based online platform
(SurveyCTO), to enable continuous data reviews and analyses, and feedback for enumerators. Any flaws with the methodologies
or tools identified during these reviews were corrected.
3.3.8 Quantitative Data Analysis
Quantitative data was disaggregated and analysed with pivots, generated with the VADER and RAKE packages, using the
Python coding language, and used to produce graphs, tables, charts, and figures, allowing for in-depth statistical analyses of
secondary, project, data, and primary data where applicable. For further information, please see Annexure 3.
3.4 Qualitative Methods
3.4.1 Data Collection and Field Research
Qualitative data was collected using the following instruments: MYRP Beneficiary Survey, MYRP Beneficiary FGD, Teacher
Training and Recruitment Survey, Implementing Staff (Teacher) KIIs, and Client and Stakeholder KIIs. The data collection tools
are included in Annexure 8.
3.4.2 Qualitative Data Analysis
The qualitative data was analysed using the VADER package, as well as a bottom-up process of inductive reasoning to identify
any incipient patterns, emerging narrative, and key themes. This approach to qualitative data analysis gives the experiences
and perspectives of participants a central position in the study of findings. This is advantageous, as beneficiaries are the ultimate
recipients in humanitarian programmes, meaning that their perspectives and experiences are critical in measuring wellbeing
outcomes, setting targets, and identifying recommendations. The VADER package was also used to generate ‘sentiment
analysis scores’ in the interval [-4,4] used to convey the overall sentiment expressed across respondents on a particular topic.
For further information, please see Annexure 3.
3.4.3 Participatory Approach Plan
Each tool was designed to ensure that evaluative methods are participatory and inclusive of those with direct involvement with
the MYRP: the orientation of data collection and evaluative analysis have been directed by the responses received from
beneficiaries and implementation staff. Additionally, the SoP ECW/MYRP Steering Committee, Technical Committee (including
the evaluation committee), MoE Core Group, and the PMU have ensured that all the deliverables meet the quality assurance
criteria. Three meetings were conducted to validate the inception report and the final report.
3.4.4 Participatory Data Analysis
UNICEF SOP and other implementing partner have contributed to data analysis through the process of reviewing and providing
feedback on multiple drafts of the present report. Partners were also involved in the development of research instruments, and
provided ongoing collaborative engagement during the development of data collection, analysis and reporting.
| 15 |
3.5 Ethical Considerations
The research upheld the following ethical safeguards for research studies: respect for dignity and diversity, right to self-
determination (informed consent), fair representation, compliance with codes for vulnerable groups (in this case UNICEF
procedures for ethical research involving children), confidentiality, and avoidance of harm. Ethical approval was sought and
received from the UNICEF HML Ethics Review Board before data collection began. The Ethical Clearance Letter is included in
Annex 7. For further information, please see Annexures 5, 6, and 7.
3.6 Field Staff Training, Pre-Testing and Translation of Finalized Tools
Enumerators received training on the appropriate deployment of the data collection tools, including training on the delivery of
surveys and focus group discussions with children based on their age, and to ensure their comfort and enthusiasm to continue
speaking with the evaluation team throughout tool deployment. The tools were pre-tested during enumerator training which took
place virtually to accommodate for both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip teams. The tools were translated by a Palestinian
Arabic speaker.
3.7 Data Flow and Management
Incoming data was checked on a regular basis, with multiple daily checks during peaks of data collection activity to ensure that
the consistency, quality and understanding of the tools was kept to a high standard at all times. This included consistent reporting
to the teams in the field and reporting to key FPs and UNICEF SoP. All limitations and challenges faced in the field were first
communicated with the FPs at the MoE or UNRWA and then later with UNICEF SoP evaluation managers (as per the lines of
communicational protocols requested by UNICEF SoP).
3.8 Data Analysis and Quality Assurance
Data was cleaned and analysed using the VADER and RAKE packages, using the Python coding language. Data cleaning was
undertaken to find possible outliers, non-normal distributions, and other anomalies in the data.
The data from the separate quantitative and qualitative tools was used to triangulate findings relating to specific themes, groups,
sectors, and program interventions. These findings were subsequently be used to answer the assignment’s research questions
(see annexure 2). Results have been disaggregated according to age, gender, and other vulnerability criteria as appropriate
and within the scope of the collected data.
3.9 Final Reporting
Final reporting was undertaken by the Thuso team, led by Matthew Goldie-Scot. Other members of the Thuso team included
Charles Schulze (Senior Consultant), Hanan Kaoud (Gender Specialist, National Consultant, and Regional Expert), Andrew
Bauer (Consultant), and Adham Mohsin (Consultant and Regional Expert).
3.10 Compliance to UNEG Norms and Standards for studies
The study was conducted in line with UNICEF’s guidelines on ethical research (UNICEF, 2015; UNEG, 2016), and guidelines
for conducting research in conflict situations (Berman, et al., 2016), to ensure that children are involved respectfully and any
potential risks of harm are prevented. The consultancy team followed the United Nations Evaluation Group’s Norms and
Standards for Evaluation (UNEG, 2016) throughout the conduct of this evaluation, and adhered to the five key evaluator
obligations namely independence, impartiality, credibility, declaration of conflicts of interest, and accountability.
3.11 Limitations and Mitigation Measures
Thuso was mindful of the following potential limitations on this final evaluation, including limited stakeholder recall or knowledge,
reliance on self-reported data, and limits on client staff time and availability. The consultants worked closely with the client to
mitigate these challenges. In the course of data collection and analysis, the following, additional, issues have the potential to
serve as limitations to findings derived from the data collected, including a lack of quantitative data on intended impacts and
outcomes, potential skewed sampling, exhaustive sampling in smaller settings, and potential for briefing of respondents. Further
information on these can be found in Annex 3.
| 16 |
Chapter 4: Evaluation Findings
The following subsections – as divided by DAC criteria (and annexed research questions) – convey the findings of the evaluation
as identified through the primary research tools described above. Further contextualisation of these insights is provided by
modality-specific documentary review within each subsection. Quantitative findings – comprising word frequency graphics (word
clouds), modality-disaggregated response scores, and sentiment analyses of respondent categories – are further provided to
supplement and evidence the written analysis supplied.
4.1 Relevance / Appropriateness
This section examines the extent to which the project is doing the ‘right thing’; it looks at whether its objectives and design
respond to the needs of beneficiaries, as well as to the priorities at global, country, and at partner/institutional level.
MYRP design and implementation sought to impact vulnerable groups by focusing on schools in close proximity to checkpoints,
in areas in which infrastructure challenges and constraints had arisen from conflict-related issues, and, in relation to internet
connectivity, to historically underserved groups. Further efforts to pivot programming to emergent COVID-19 needs also further
promoted a view of intended responsiveness to the needs of children in target zones. However, the lack of strong MEAL and
outcome monitoring/documentation, and dependence on self-reporting of implementing partners, makes it challenging to
establish the degree to which programming directly responded to the priority needs of children in SoP, an aspect which can be
strengthened in future MYRPs in SoP.
EQ1: How relevant, appropriate, and significant is the SoP ECW/MYRP at the country level?
How can these aspects be strengthened in any future MYRPs in SoP?
A. To what extent and how does the SoP ECW/MYRP respond to/reduce differentiated age, gender, geographic,
disability and/or socio-economic based inequalities and needs of the most conflict/crisis affected population
groups i.e. boys and girls, IDPs/refugees children, children with disabilities?
A review of the approach taken to respond to, and reduce differentiated inequalities and needs (including those resulting from
age, gender, geographic, disability and/or socio-economic factors), suggests that MYRP design and implementation sought to
impact vulnerable groups by focusing on schools in close proximity to checkpoints, in areas in which infrastructure challenges
and constraints had arisen from conflict-related issues, and, in relation to internet connectivity, to historically underserved groups.
Narrative reporting of programming under the MYRP supports this also, with a progressive increase in the number of children
impacted, i.e. a 28% increase in the number of children reached in 2021 (ECW narrative report for period 01/2021 – 12/2021,
2022). Programming demonstrably sought to meet the needs of vulnerable groups - of the total 450,428 children targeted in
2021, 326,197 (72.4%) were refugees and 13,537 (3%) were children with disabilities (ECW narrative report for period 01/2020
– 12/2020, 2021, p. 4), while UNDP conducted technical consultations with the MoE for infrastructure improvements in line with
child-friendly, gender sensitive criteria, including facilitation for children with disabilities (ECW narrative report for period 01/2020
– 12/2020, 2021).
Significant ‘pivoting’ of focus, under reprogrammed activities seeking to address the distinct needs arising during the COVID-
19 pandemic and associated lockdowns, inevitably impacted on some programming initially planned; for example, while a set
of standards was drafted, and school infrastructure models identified to better cater to the needs of vulnerable learners, COVID-
19 delayed next-stage technical dialogue (ECW narrative report for period 01/2020 – 12/2020, 2021). As such, partners were
still able to continue conducting activity under the MYRP which sought to reduce disability-based inequalities.
Despite the challenges faced, a range of steps were implemented under the MYRP with a view to promoting inclusion in the
Palestinian education system. For example, while funding for the development of a package of assistive devices for Children
with Disabilities (CwD) was redirected to combatting COVID-19 effects in 2020 and 2021, the data collection relating to need
for such devices was nonetheless still achieved (ECW narrative report for period 07/2020 – 12/2020, 2021). This allowed
UNESCO and UNDP to develop the package of assistive devices needed for CwD in coordination with the MoE in 2021,
providing future programming with pre-defined support option to roll-out.
Likewise, in 2021, UNRWA supported children in the Gaza Strip with additional learning needs in Arabic and Math, with a specific
focus on the needs of children with conflict and crisis-related injuries or chronic health issues. This complimented UNESCO’s
successful training of teachers to provide psychosocial support (PSS) to children with prolonged hospitalization. Following this,
the learning gap between hospital learning and mainstream school settings was reportedly bridged for prolonged hospitalized
children (ECW narrative report for period 01/2021 – 12/2021).
| 17 |
The findings detailed above are largely reflected in responses garnered from primary data, including both KII and FGD responses,
with a majority of respondents expressing agreement with the sentiment that interventions met the needs of those most in need.
That said, while this suggests a broad understanding of the needs of inequalities and needs of targeted groups, it is not clear
that a rigorous, evidence-based, approach informed the targeting process. Feedback from senior stakeholder KIIs suggest that
a ‘post-hoc’ and ‘pragmatic’ approach was adopted, seeking to build upon existing programming and approaches, rather than
working from a clear data-set to inform the overall focus, and associated targeting. This was perhaps compounded by a lack of
baseline data at inception – while a baseline study (ARAD, 2020) was indeed undertaken, and includes a range of data on
vulnerable groups within SoP, this was undertaken after not only planning for the MYRP was complete, but after programming
had already begun, due to significant delays in the procurement process to commission the baseline study. This also resulted
in a lack of comparative data, i.e. it does not appear that implementation partners drew upon, or reported on, the indicators set
out within the baseline study findings. This undermines reporting on impact, and potential for robust lesson-learning from the
activities under the MYRP. Of the MYRP aspects which would benefit from being strengthened in future MYRPs in SoP, this
factor is perhaps the most significant.
B. How well does it adapt to needs and contexts of the country?
The approach to programming appears to have been cognisant of, informed by, and appropriate to the distinct needs and
contexts of the country, insofar as this pertains to activities which target vulnerable groups which are distinct to the national
context of SoP, such as the relatively high number of ex-detainees, and children under house arrest.
This included remedial/alternate education interventions for ex-detainee children and children under house arrest. 54 female
and 50 male children in this category received remedial classes in 2020 (ECW narrative report for period 01/2020 – 12/2020,
2021). Additionally, in 2021, 20 children under house arrest and 300 ex-detainee children were supported by Save the Children
with educational kits (stationery, educational games, and hygiene kits) (ECW narrative report for period 01/2021 – 12/2021, p.
5). These interventions were received overwhelmingly positively by beneficiaries. For example, within one group of remedial
education supported children, of which 13 were ex detainees and 8 were under house arrest, 98% reported positive change in
their understanding of the three subjects covered: English, Mathematics, and Chemistry.
Based on an understanding that the context of the country required more than simply academic support for ex-detainees and
children under house arrest, an array of psychosocial support (PSS) was also provided. Trainings for the delivery of this support
were adapted to ensure safety during COVID-19, just as the support was adapted to children’s specific needs. Across the 17
West Bank Education Directorates, Save the Children provided 370 MoE school counsellors (247 F, 123 M) with training to
provide tele-psychosocial consultations in stress management techniques (ECW narrative report for period 01/2020 – 12/2020,
2021). As a result of this training and other programming, a total 260 (9 F, 251 M) children, including 243 ex-detainees (8 F,
235 M) and 17 children under house arrest (1 F, 16 M), were assessed and received individual and group counselling (ECW
narrative report for period 01/2021 – 12/2021, p. 9). 164 caregivers of ex-detainee and under-house-arrest children also
received counselling, after which 79.1% reported improved awareness of children’s PSS needs and how they can assist, as
opposed to only 44% prior to the intervention. Overall, 83% of the engaged parents and caregivers of these children reported
satisfaction with the PSS provisions their children received (ECW narrative report for period 01/2021 – 12/2021, 2022). It is
worth noting that a high proportion of support given to male detainees likely reflects an appropriate approach to programming,
taking account of the demographics of detainees (ECW narrative report for period 01/2021 – 12/2021, p. 9).
It can be inferred that the psychosocial support received by vulnerable children was well adapted to their specific needs, as
high percentages of beneficiaries reported change in their mental state. For example, of all children who received psychosocial
support, 84% reported positive change in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) related symptoms (ECW narrative report for
period 01/2021 – 12/2021, p. 9). Moreover, of all the children targeted by Save the Children with PSS in 2021, 84.1% reported
feeling better able to express their feelings and the stress caused by the emergency, in comparison to 42.9% prior to the
intervention. Likewise, 81.7% reported improved ability to deal with emergency-caused anger and stress in contrast to 46%
prior to the intervention (ECW narrative report for period 01/2021 – 12/2021, p. 9). The statistics were similar for those provided
with PSS in 2021: 84.1% reported improvement in their ability to express their feelings (42.9% prior); and 81.7% reported
improved ability to deal with anger and stress (46% prior). This suggests that flexibility and adaptiveness was built into the
MYRP-led trainings undertaken by PSS providers; counsellors were able to adjust their support for children to ensure their
context-specific needs were met in an outcome producing way.
Further to this, a range of wider support programming, pertinent to the distinct needs of SoP, included adaptation to security
challenges. For example, in 2020, UNESCO and UNDP provided DRR equipment to schools to help better equip 5,345 children
(684 F; 4,661 M) for disasters and emergencies.

In addition, significant ‘pivoted’ support relating to COVID-19 was provided under reprogrammed activities. For example, in
2020, 18,809 children directly benefited from PSS in the form of recreational activities, sports and drama provided by UNRWA
West Bank and the Gaza Strip, UNICEF SoP, and UNESCO (ECW narrative report for period 01/2020 – 12/2020, 2021). In
2021, 140,183 were reached through 12 online sports challenges (ECW narrative report for period 01/2021 – 12/2021).
Overall, 94.5% of students expressed positive views relating to the sports events they participated in (ECW narrative report for
period 01/2021 – 12/2021) and those interviewed post-survey expressed gratitude:
I enjoyed the day, it was a psychological relief, fun, enjoyable for us, it was filled with respect, love, and appreciation to you
all … I also liked the reflection and discussion at the end of the games, because it connects between the game and our
future.

(ECW NARRATIVE REPORT FOR PERIOD 01/2021 – 12/2021, P. 18).
In 2021, UNESCO also delivered relief activities to 10 more marginalized schools in Area C by conducting drama, games, and
storytelling activities with 932 (497 F, 435 M) children (ECW narrative report for period 01/2021 – 12/2021, p. 18).
The MoE worked to ensure MYRP programming during COVID-19 was meeting the most urgent needs of children. For example,
following an MoE request for intervention to support learning loss activities in 2021, summer camp activities were arranged for
10,000 students (5,500 F, 4,500 M), 360 teachers, 100 school principals and 34 supervisors (275 F, 219 M) in the West Bank.
Feedback from students and parents suggests that the camps were well adapted to meet the needs of children and provide
relief from their context-specific challenges. For example, one parent said:
I hope this would be a constant summer activity for the children, they don’t only play in a safe place, they also learn.
PARENT INTERVIEWED BY IMPLEMENTING PARTNER
(ECW NARRATIVE REPORT FOR PERIOD 01/2021 – 12/2021, P. 19)
43 children out of the 10,000 were assessed pre- and post- the summer camp intervention. All (100%) showed
improvement.6
Alongside offering ‘safe spaces’ for children to play and learn, MYRP programming adapted to the context of COVID-19 by
helping to make schools safer. In 2020, UNCEF utilised the Year 1 MYRP Gaza Strip flexible emergency funds to allocate hygiene
kits to 219 government schools in the Gaza Strip’s most vulnerable communities. This benefitted an estimated 81,906 children
(ECW narrative report for period 01/2020 – 12/2020, 2021). Beneficiary feedback on this adapted programming was strongly
positive: 74% of the school principals and teachers surveyed in 2021 agreed or totally agreed that SoP ECW/MYRP interventions
better equipped schools to deal with emergencies and crises.
The relevance of such programming as reported in narrative documentation can be triangulated with the responses garnered
in primary data collection. Children who had recently served sentences almost universally expressed that they had reduced
social skills and more reclusive tendencies upon returning to their communities. They considered the psychological support to
be a strong priority and expected that the intervention would be similarly relevant for all such young ex-detainees.
I was arrested when I was 13 years old […] We need[ed] support and rehabilitation so that we do not feel that we are a
burden on society.

Likewise, the selection of implementation partners to allow for geographic ‘reach’, and access to vulnerable groups, particularly
in areas where accessibility has been impacted by conflict and security-related challenges distinct to the SoP context (i.e.
restrictions on travel, at checkpoints, restrictions on infrastructure development in selected schools) (ECW, 2019), demonstrate
ways in which the MYRP design has been adapted to meet the needs and context of SoP. Additional local needs were noted by
both teachers and students. Participant teachers in a reportedly underfunded school noted that ‘[they] want to provide breakfast
6 Source: (ECW narrative report for period 01/2021 – 12/2021)
| 19 |
meals for students because there are students who did not take their expenses because of the economic situation, [as well as
to] provide transportation [for the children].’ In addition, teachers in high-security-risk communities require ‘the provision of
transportation for students, the provision of stationery and sports teachers, and psychological support for students because
they suffer from permanent conflicts because they are in a border area.’ From an inclusivity perspective, certain respondents
indicate that infrastructural improvements have scope to improve disability sensitivity, thereby improving their relevance for
service users (‘the negative part of the matter is that we were given tools that are not suitable for our institution, such as stairs’).
Further needs as identified by children by modality area were as follows. Here, it is to be noted that the requests for continuity
of existing modalities of support attests to the strong relevance of programming received:
Modality of Support Additional Support Needs Reported by Children
Cleaning materials for 2020 grade 12 exams and Continuation of PPE provision and surface decontamination
the Gaza Strip Back to School
Science and IT Learning Kits Provision of notebooks, pens, pencils, exercise books, sketchbooks, white erasers, and food;

Multi-sectoral support for ex-detainee and Continuity of psychological support
detained children
Findings from narrative reports on overarching relevance, as detailed above, can be triangulated with findings from primary
research undertaken for the purposes of this evaluation, with feedback from child and teacher respondents. However, the
extensiveness of needs in SoP amongst children and their teaching institutions suggests that many other locations remain in
need of support in certain modalities pertaining to the MYRP – most saliently the availability of school resources (stationery,
book bags, interactive personal electronic devices) and public-health-responsive equipment (such as sanitiser and face masks).
This observation draws on an ineluctable sampling limitation of the evaluation methodology adopted: namely, that beneficiary
respondents (who make up the vast majority of survey data) do not necessarily possess a clear evidence-based on the
vulnerability profile of others. Nevertheless, in no case did the evaluation team identify any claims amongst respondents that
other people who were not included in the MYRP were in clearly greater need of support than beneficiaries. In contrast, while
responses varied between modalities, a clear majority of respondents expressed agreement with the review that interventions
met the needs of those most in need:
Primary MYRP Beneficiary Survey data provides quantitative support for this finding, i.e. across the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
This is presented below:

Data provided in the chart above highlights strong relevance of programming for those most in need as reported by beneficiaries
across all modalities of programming in the Gaza Strip. Those agreeing that programming was relevant to such needs chiefly
pointed to the needs for all community members to overcome challenges to in-person activities brought about by the COVID-
19 pandemic as well as a general need for education amongst all beneficiary students. Those students who raised concerns
over the adequacy of the interventions’ support in catering to those most in need of support unanimously pointed to the
insufficiency of consumable materials provided as part of the MYRP. This coloured the overall opinion of many respondents from
the smaller sample of recipients of Science/IT Kits, leading to larger underperformance for this dimension of support than across
others.

Similarly high levels of agreement that the intervention met the needs of those most in need are clear amongst beneficiaries
surveyed in the West Bank. Those who disagreed with the positive consensus on this question largely explained their view in
terms of their aversion to remote education (and – as a corollary – any support directed towards facilitating it instead of
supporting a return to the classroom). While beneficiaries of DEAL life skills showed notably lower levels of approval for the
ability of these sessions to support those most in need, explanations for this view were not forthcoming (although may be
explained with reference to the views of certain beneficiaries that the economy and the skills taught were not conducive to
finding employment or meeting their professional interests, respectively). Nevertheless, responses amongst the majority of
beneficiaries who spoke positively about this intervention highlighted their need for support in Arabic and Mathematics
(considered areas of academic weakness), and support for the basic enabling conditions of a good education, including safe
environments (safety equipment, DRR equipment, cleaning materials, WASH rehabilitation) and appropriate in-school resources
(Science/IT learning and internet access).
KIIs with senior stakeholders largely reflected these views, though a concern was raised by senior stakeholders over the
evidence-base, and underlying process, underpinning the development of the MYRP. Most specifically, it was suggested that,
in some cases, implementation partners’ areas of interest, expertise, and programming priorities may have informed the
modalities of intervention, rather than a robust evidence-base arising from the Needs Assessment.
I felt there was a lack of joint planning, joint design, I felt it was more of an adaptation of agencies’ single mandates rather
than a joint planning process with a broader range of stakeholders. What I feel has happened, and when I look at the results
framework, I felt we went through a process, perhaps a design phase, but the process was back to front, i.e. partners were
selected first, rather than a structured planning, informed by analysis. There were overlaps between agencies interventions.
The Results Framework exists, but I don’t consider that it is coherent. Everyone is doing what they decided to anyway, and
we are pretending it is coherent.

A significant factor identified which may have compounded such issues relates to the aforementioned practical constraint faced
during the design, and initial implementation of the MYRP, i.e. that the baseline study (ARAD, 2020) was significantly delayed,
and was thus unavailable as a resource to inform programming, and with no monitoring by implementation partners of the
indicators set out therein.
As indicated above, beneficiaries of support in the Gaza Strip were largely positive in their responses on relevance. Where
reservations were expressed from a minority of respondents in the West Bank, these largely stemmed from a small number of
respondents expressing the view that they were not able to respond with confidence as to which groups within SoP were most
in need. An interrogation of the findings from primary research suggests that it is possible that the comparatively lower level of
agreement amongst participants in the DEAL Life Skills intervention stems from the fact that the respondents were older, and
therefore more hesitant to comment authoritatively on the needs of others. Reservations raised by others largely pertained to a
view expressed by certain students either that certain beneficiaries in their school were not amongst the ‘most in need in the
State of Palestine’, or that intervention dimensions involving sports or interactive learning modalities were not addressing the
most salient needs. Lastly, it was reported by some respondents that distance learning provision was not an adequate substitute
for in-person education, and therefore this modality was not sufficiently needs-responsive – this is a response which reflects
wider findings in research literature highlighting the potential limitations of distance learning modalities in SoP (Subaih, Sabbah,
& Al-Duais, 2021).

4.2 Coherence
Coherence refers to the compatibility of the intervention with other interventions in a country, sector or institution. This section
examines the extent to which the SoP ECW/MYRP aligned with, complemented, and leveraged international and national
humanitarian-development system(s) and related plans, policies, and frameworks, as well as the ECW Global strategic plan,
core functions and other investment modalities (FER).
Primary findings suggest that beneficiary populations report high-levels of alignment of programming in most areas in the West
Bank, with 100% of respondents reporting the same in the Gaza Strip. Broader findings suggest a broadly positive role played
by engagement in the MYRP’s development and implementation in improving communication and coordination, as well as
facilitating some activities undertaken with funding from other sources, while noting that communication and coordination
remained an area in which practice could continue to be improved.
EQ2: To what extent is the SoP ECW/MYRP aligning with, complementing, and leveraging
international and national humanitarian-development system(s) and related plans, policies, and
frameworks? How can these aspects be strengthened in future SoP MYRPs?
MYRP programming was aligned with international humanitarian standards of ‘do no harm’. In the Gaza Strip, none of the
respondents reported that harm was caused to them or to anyone else as a result of the intervention they received. Responses
provided by beneficiaries to the question of harms induced – either directly or indirectly – through participation in MYRP-
supported projects, do not provide evidence of any such harm for respondents or others of whom they are aware in their
community. Nevertheless, certain beneficiaries of COVID-related cleaning materials noted that some beneficiaries, having lost
their mask, subsequently became ill – attributing this harm to the responsibility of the intervention. While this is an important
concern in terms of the effectiveness of the intervention at reducing the spread of COVID-19, the evidence provided does not
indicate that programming played any causal role in health-related challenges for beneficiaries.

In relation to alignment and collaboration on sources of funding, senior respondents from within implementing partners largely
reported:
i) A positive role played by engagement in the MYRP’s development and implementation in improving communication
and coordination, i.e. by providing a context in which the parties need to work together; and
ii) A reported view that work undertaken under the auspices of the MYRP had facilitated activities undertaken with
funding from other sources, as well as precipitating proactive engagement with a range of donors to allow for
continuity of provision.
Some nonetheless expressed the view that communication and coordination remained an area in which practice could continue
to be improved, and noted that some programming remained fragmented, allowing for potential overlap of funded activities, and
thereby duplication of effort, and a resulting lack of coherence.
A sentiment amongst myriad stakeholders that ECW was a ‘flexible’ donor, was reported with approbation in a range of KIIs with
senior stakeholders, who suggested that this had been particularly constructive when ‘pivoting’ in response to shifts in
government priority during the COVID-19 pandemic.
EQ3: How does the SoP ECW/MYRP align with, complement, and leverage ECW Global
strategic plan, core functions and other investment modalities (FER)? How can this be
strengthened?
The SoP MYRP was developed and launched in response to the ECW Global Strategic Plan (2018-2021), whose goal was to
support interventions reaching 8 million crisis-affected children and youth by 2021 (ECW , 2018). The SoP MYRP is aligned with
the ECW strategic objectives and outcomes, as follows:
| 23 |
SoP MYRP SoP MYRP
ECW Strategic Objectives Collective Education Outcomes
Alignment Alignment
Increase political support to education in crises ✓ Access ✓
Increase financing for education in crises ✓ Equity + Gender equality ✓
Improve joint planning and responses ✓ Continuity ✓
Strengthen capacity to respond ✓ Protection ✓
Improve accountability ✓ Quality ✓
The consistency of this alignment over the past two years led to securing Y3 seed funds from the ECW Secretariat (ECW
narrative report for period 01/2021 – 12/2021, 2022).
A. To what extent does the SoP ECW/MYRP align and collaborate with other sources of funding (government,
other donors or Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs))?
A recent comparative analysis of MYRP funding in multiple countries concludes that ‘it is not possible to differentiate between
funding that has been redirected from other existing sources in-country to the MYRP and funding that is entirely new to the
country and that would not have flowed in countries if there were no MYRP in place’ (Venalainen, Anderson, & Elte, 2021, p.
73); for this reason, it should be understood that ‘counterfactuals’ cannot be established in the course of this evaluation. Instead,
the reviewers consider all funding that has supported the MYRP but is not ECW seed funding as aligned funding. Based on this
definition, they estimate that US$27,741,325 aligns with the target populations of the MYRP (Venalainen, Anderson, & Elte,
2021, p. 74).
One limited example identified in the course of the evaluation comprised funding received not from ECW but for the achievement
of MYRP objectives is UNICEF SoP and Save the Children’s direct receival of US$850,000 to support the MYRP and MoE’s
COVID-19 Response Plan in 2020 (ECW narrative report for period 01/2020 – 12/2020, 2021). The funds were used to build a
sustainable distance learning system and implement safe school operations.
B. To what extent and how are the key actors (ECW, beneficiaries, Government, Civil Society Organisations
(CSOs) and MYRP partners) engaged in the design, planning, implementation, and monitoring of the
interventions and how can this be strengthened?
Concerns were raised by a wide range of senior stakeholders, directly involved in the design, planning, and implementation of
the interventions that the design process was somewhat ‘rushed’, undermining some aspects of collaborative development. A
third-party review of MYRP funding in SoP and other countries notes that local organisations often face barriers to becoming
MYRP grantees due to short timelines for selection processes, which only larger organisations are resourced enough to respond
to (Venalainen, Anderson, & Elte, 2021). This echoes potential issues highlighted in feedback on ‘Relevance’:
I felt there was a lack of joint planning, joint design, I felt it was more of an adaptation of agencies’ single mandates rather
than a joint planning process with a broader range of stakeholders. What I feel has happened, and when I look at the results
framework, I felt we went through a process, perhaps a design phase, but the process was back to front, i.e. partners were
selected first, rather than a structured planning, informed by analysis. There were overlaps between agencies interventions.
The Results Framework exists, but I don’t consider that it is coherent. Everyone is doing what they decided to anyway, and
we are pretending it is coherent.

This suggests an understandable reliance on established partners, with whom working relationships were already in place,
particularly given practical considerations, networks of trust, and time constraints. While this has some clear benefits, as
demonstrated by the efficacy of a wide range of programming and activities under the MYRP, it has the potential to limit
engagement by smaller organisations, with potential implications for localisation agendas, .i.e. findings suggest local actors have
primarily been engaged with on the basis of pre-existing relationships and networks, rather on an echaustive, proactive, and
consultative basis.
The views expressed by key stakeholders in primary research responses representing consortium partner organisation indicate
that the development of the MYRP showed a strong regard for the existing capacities of large active iNGOs within the country.
While this meant that the interventions undertaken by partner organisations were well aligned with existing capabilities and
networks of local implementing partners and CSOs, there was a concern that intervention modalities may have been somewhat
overly aligned to prospective consortium member preferences rather than adequately tailored towards a coherent intervention
| 24 |
in which the different components were mutually supportive of long-term developmental (rather than responsive) outcomes.
Another risk to this approach – as identified by consortium staff members – was that it potentially excludes other organisations
operating in the country from adequate opportunities to participate in the MYRP and receive funding thus. This is because –
through tailoring interventions towards the capacities of large in-country operators who did not (at the time) comprise the
consortium for the programme – it was reportedly difficult for smaller local organisations to insert themselves usefully into the
programme’s implementational framework. The capacity of CSOs, CBOs, and national NGOs to operate similarly
comprehensive programming within the country without overarching support from such actors as comprised the MYRP’s
consortium remains to be researched further, but it is to be considered in this context that there may be gains in terms of
financial efficiency from such an approach to implementation, since these smaller organisations typically have lower
administrative and logistical costs embedded into their organisational operation.
It should be emphasised that this is not to suggest there was no involvement with local partners, but to highlight widely reported
concerns over potential barriers to entry, particularly with regard to smaller NGOs competing effectively with iNGOs in navigating
procurement processes (as highlighted in selected responses by local NGO representatives in KIIs). Notwithstanding these
issues, there are a range of examples of engagement with local partners under the MYRP. For instance, in 2020, Save the
Children, MoE, and local partners collaborated to develop the supervision capacities of 25 MoE supervisors. The training,
including guidance on offering PSS, was designed to give them the opportunity to receive a diploma on supervision. Building on
this success, in 2021, 468 MoE counsellors (306 F,162 M) were trained on comprehensive PPS delivery. These supervisors
were also provided with laptops to assist further learning in this department (ECW narrative report for period 01/2021 – 12/2021,
p. 5).
C. To what extent and how coherent is the MYRP with global humanitarian development frameworks such as
the Grand Bargain Commitments, New Way of Working, and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4, Global
Compact for Refugees, key principles of Human Rights-based Approach to Programming etc.?
The MYRP Theory of Change (ToC) was designed to reflect and respond to the rights of all children to have access to basic
education as enshrined in the 1960 UNESCO Convention against Discrimination in Education, the 1989 UN Convention of the
Right of the Child (CRC), ratified by the State of Palestine, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 4, 5 and 10. The
MYRP ToC was also designed to reflect and respond to the rights of all children to a safe education as enshrined in the Safe
School Declaration 2015 (ECW, 2019).
The SoP MYRP was also designed to coordinate a wide range of humanitarian actors to support its implementation, facilitating
joined programming in order to maximise capacity and reach. This is in line with the UN ‘New Way of Working’ (NWOW), which
‘calls on humanitarian and development actors to work collaboratively, based on their comparative advantages, towards
‘collective outcomes’ that reduce need, risk and vulnerability over multiple years’ (UN, n.d.).
Selected KIIs suggest concerns over coherence, arising from issues relating to communication and transparency:
There was a lot of overlap – I remember looking at one of the interim reports, and the results matrix – I was asking ‘how are
we sure we are not double-counting’ as I had the feeling that some of the agencies were working with the same people doing
the same things; [there was] a sense that we picked partners first, then retrospectively suggested a coherent approach.
FEMALE – SENIOR STAKEHOLDER KII
The SoP MYRP also included a substantial focus on equity and inclusivity, in line with a Human Rights-Based Approach to
programming.
Selected feedback from senior stakeholder KIIs provides insight into the coherence of the MYRP with global humanitarian
development frameworks such as the Grand Bargain Commitments, and the Global Compact for Refugees. Most specifically,
many stakeholders expressed significant support a greater focus on the localisation agenda. In particular, a range of local
stakeholders suggested that high operational overheads of selected international implementation partners potentially render
them less suited to cost-effective local delivery than local CSO organisations, though representatives of the former suggested
that ongoing capacity building is required for more localised programming to be effective – not all local organisations reportedly
concur with this view.
| 25 |
D. To what extent and how is it coherent with in-country Education in Emergencies and Protracted Crises (EiEPC)
initiatives / strategies / policies / plans incl. MoE Education Sector Strategic Plan (ESSP) 2017- 2022, MoE
COVID-19 response plan, Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) and UNRWA Mid-Term Strategy, among others?
(ensuring complementarity, harmonisation and co-ordination with others, including accounting for gaps, and the
extent to which the intervention is adding value while avoiding duplication of effort.)
Rather than creating a new framework, the SoP MYRP was
Figure 6: Strengthened capacity of the education system to
designed to add value to existing national strategies and plans by respond to chronic humanitarian needs and to deliver a
improving co-ordination and prioritisation across them (ECW, coordinated and mainstreamed response
2019). The SoP Education Sector Strategic Plan (ESSP) 2017-
2022 is the overarching framework for humanitarian and
development education interventions in SoP. Additionally, as of
2019, the following strategies and plans defined the government
and partners’ interventions which aimed to ensure that crisis-
affected children in the country have access to quality education:
▪ Joint Advocacy and Protection Strategy (JPAS)
▪ The UNRWA Mid-Term Strategy (UNRWA MTS) (including
its EiE programme); and
▪ the Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP)
▪ National Inter-sectoral Violence against Children Strategy
in the Context of Covid-19 (NIVACS) 2021-2023.
The MYRP is coherent with the main disaster law in the State of
Palestine, the Palestinian Civil Defence Law No 3. This law does not
include reference to safety in schools but does feature reference to
prevention and mitigation measures more broadly, including the
prepositioning of equipment and materials (IFRC, 2023). Thus, the
(ECW, 2019)
provision of 5,345 children with DRR and safety equipment by
UNESCO and UNDP in 2021 can be considered an initiative coherent with national policies.
Moreover, in 2021, 9 out the MoE’s 25 schools’ improvement plans were responded to with the provision of school furniture by
UNICEF SoP (ECW narrative report for period 01/2021 – 12/2021, p. 5). Specifically, UNICEF SoP provided furniture to the
benefit of an estimated 15,050 children (ECW narrative report for period 01/2021 – 12/2021, p. 5).
Turning to the Ministry of Education and Higher Education’s Sector Strategic Plan (ESSP) 2017-2022, several objectives were
directly supported by MYRP programming (MoE, 2017). For example:
Goal 1 of the strategic plan is ‘ensuring safe, inclusive and equitable access to equal education at all levels of the system’ (MoE,
2017, p. 110). In 2021, 575 latrines and 250 classrooms were built or rehabilitated with support from by UNRWA, UNDP, and
SCI (ECW narrative report for period 01/2021 – 12/2021, p. 5). 70% of respondent school principals and teachers agreed that
these rehabilitation works contributed to improved safety and accessibility in schools and reduced the possibility of children
dropping out (ibid). In 2020, infrastructure works were completed at four schools, benefitting an estimated 734 students (597
F, 137 M) and receiving similar feedback (ECW narrative report for period 01/2020 – 12/2020, 2021). Thus, consistent direct
alignment with the Ministry of Education’s strategic plan was achieved by MYRP programming.
MYPR programming has also directly addressed Goal 2 of the plan, which aims to provide ‘appropriate teaching and learning
resources’ to achieve a student-centred learning environment for all children (MoE, 2017, p. 44). For example, in 2021, 4,694
classrooms were supported with teaching & learning materials (ECW narrative report for period 01/2021 – 12/2021, p. 5).
Goal 2 also explicitly mentions ‘increasing the use of technology and other modern techniques’ under the sub-aim of ensuring
quality education for all basic school students (MoE, 2017, p. 156). Balancing the spirit of this goal and adaptation to SoP’s
evolving context for education, UNRWA provided 125,110 children in 2020 and 159,486 children in 2021 with school level
learning toolkits, an in-classroom learning assistance tool used by teachers to enhance English, Science, and IT learning (ECW
narrative report for period 01/2021 – 12/2021, p. 5).
Thus, it can be concluded that the ESSP (2017-2022) provided an overarching framework for the development of the SoP
MYRP. The MYRP was designed to be situated in the ESSP goals and priorities and linked to the three other relevant strategies
and plans, as illustrated in the Figure 6, with key interventions consolidated under MYRP marked in red.

The SoP MYRP was also adapted to include modalities focused on COVID-19. Specific alignments with the following MoE

This reported coherence and complementarity is triangulated by primary responses at a school-level, with high-levels reporting
an alignment of programming in most areas in the West Bank, and 100% of respondents in the Gaza Strip agreeing that the
intervention worked well alongside other schooling or support received.

With the exception of providing DRR equipment to schools in high-risk areas, at least 9 out of every 10 students volunteering
their view on this issue provided a positive response over the complementarity of service provision. This is to be explained for
modalities with limited in-school presence from beneficiaries (such as multi-sectoral support for ex-detainees) by the fact that
abstentions to this question were excluded from the overall total calculations. Upon review of qualitative responses offered in
justification for the answers given to this question, many of those who denied complementarity between MYRP-based and other
in-school support considered the two kinds of provisions to be orthogonal to one another, rather than actively antagonistic. This
was particularly true amongst respondents on the modality of DRR Equipment – data relating to which is largely an artefact of
whether children saw support which was independent from their in-school learning to ‘work well’ alongside it nonetheless. In no
case reviewed by the evaluation team was it clear that there was detrimental overlap of interventions with pre-existing
programming in the area, or (with the exception of certain beneficiaries of internet access support requesting better hardware)
that the enabling conditions for the intervention on which it depended were not there. Elsewhere, less positive views on the
MYRP’s complementarity is largely attributable to students not expressing confidence in the ‘value’ of the support provided, or
the support not going ‘far enough’ in supporting with the needs for which it was intended.
Less positive views on the MYRP’s coherence – as indicated by proportion of assent by modality in the chart above – is largely
attributable to students not expressing confidence in the ‘value’ of the support provided, or the support not going ‘far enough’
in supporting with the needs for which it was intended. In no case reviewed by the evaluation team was it clear that there was
detrimental overlap of interventions with pre-existing programming in the area, or (with the exception of certain beneficiaries of

internet access support requesting better hardware) that the enabling conditions for the intervention on which it depended were
not there.
Amongst interventions supported by the MYRP, the following charts give an indication of programmatic overlap by modality, as
reported by respondents to primary data collection:

The data above indicates that overlapping programming may have supported synergistic outcomes for beneficiaries in the Gaza
Strip. Only 6% of (female) recipients of cleaning materials were without support from at least one further dimension of MYRP
support, with the majority of beneficiaries of the remaining modalities also receiving benefits from another stream of
programming (with the exception of Arabic/Maths camps, which were held outside of the school calendar). Discrepancies in
gender-based proportion across modalities are within the sample’s margin of error (with the exception of Science and IT Kits,
which suffers from an insufficient sample size to draw a conclusion from this disparity). It is to be noted that these responses
are entirely self-reported; for this reason, there is some risk that smaller MYRP-support interventions were forgotten by
respondents (particularly younger beneficiaries), or, similarly, that programmes not supported by, but concurrent with, the MYRP
were mistaken for MYRP-supported programming.

Compared with data reviewed above for the overlap of programming beneficiaries in the Gaza Strip, evidence in the above chart
suggests that a comparatively wider pool of beneficiaries was supported in the West Bank with fewer resources. This is
particularly the case for recipients of cleaning materials, DRR equipment, and internet access, which is to be explained by the
fact that all three dimensions of programming targeted schools on a geographical basis, rather than exclusively based on
economic need or other dimensions of deprivation of the students in attendance.
This does not suggest a lack of coherence, and potentially points to a significant degree of complementarity, and mutuality of
support under the MYRP, though some concerns were raised in KIIs over potential for efficiencies, specifically focused on
‘duplication of effort’:
I think there were some missed opportunities to work towards joint results – every implementing agency was working towards
its own results.

4.3 Efficiency
Efficiency refers to the extent to which the intervention delivers results in an economic (cost-effective) and timely way, as well
as how well the intervention was managed (operational efficiency). This section addresses economic efficiency, timeliness of
delivery and programme management of the ECW programme.
| 28 |
Primary research findings suggest a high degree of perceived efficiency in relation to a range of modalities, with the notable
exception of Arabic/Maths Camps. Likewise, senior stakeholders suggest a high-degree of efficiency, notwithstanding
challenges arising from approval processes and related bureaucratic issues, noted in narrative reports. Questions were raised
in primary research over a fragmented approach to programming potentially undermining the efficiency of interventions. Some
delays arose due to responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.
EQ4: To what extent is the SoP ECW/MYRP managed in an efficient, timely and transparent
manner? How can these aspects be strengthened in any future MYRPs?
Quantitative survey responses give an indication of how many beneficiaries feel that the SoP ECW/MYRP was managed in a
transparent manner.
In the Gaza Strip, those who did not believe that targeting was transparent and fair did not provide any evidence of unfairness
in the targeting of support, but rather identified that there were many who were not supported by the intervention in their school
and the reason for their exclusion was unclear. This view pertained particularly to recipients of cleaning materials. The large
majority (82.5%) of respondents who did not believe that supported targeting was transparent and fair abstained from answering
the question on the grounds that they did not consider themselves to be sufficiently informed. These abstentions affect summary
statistics for Arabic/Maths camps significantly.

In the West Bank, the vast majority (82.4%) of respondents who did not believe that supported targeting was transparent and
fair abstained from answering the question on the grounds that they did not consider themselves to be sufficiently informed.
Those who provided a reason against fairness of selection noted that certain members of their school community either didn’t
receive internet-enabled devices or weren’t able to participate in in-class games (depending on the modalities received by the
respondent). Similarly, many who commended the transparency of programme selection did not demonstrate knowledge of the
selection approach used by the relevant implementing agency, but rather observed that all students in their class or children in
their school were able to enjoy programmatic benefits (either as direct beneficiaries or as those collectively enjoying a shared
infrastructural benefit).
A. How efficient is the organizational set-up and partnership approach (PMU, grantees/UNICEF SoP, the SC
and TC, MoE) arrangements of the SoP ECW/MYRP across the project cycle phases and has it been
effective in its operations?
Primary data garnered from Ministry Officials largely reflected a positive view of the efficiency of the MYRP:
Because of the MYRP, we have been able to impact more stakeholders efficiently.
SENIOR MINISTRY KII STAKEHOLDER, MALE
A range of implementing partners expressed similar views, particularly in light of challenges faced:
| 29 |
Considering the crises in context [it was undertaken in a] reasonable timeframe given that when COVID hit the country
[partners were] able to reprogramme and respond … Delays were all justified because of the obstacles to implementation [in
particular, ongoing teacher strikes].
UN AGENCY IMPLEMENTING PARTNER KII, FEMALE
Some concerns were raised in narrative reporting over efficiency losses arising from approval processes, and related
bureaucratic hurdles:
Lengthy approval processes for some interventions by MoE, and for some agreements/contracting and the ECW Secretariat’s
frequent changing of donor reporting requirements and templates (twice in 2021) created inefficiency and additional
pressure.
(ECW NARRATIVE REPORT FOR PERIOD 01/2021 – 12/2021, P. 37).
As with much MYRP programming undertaken during the COVID-19 pandemic (Venalainen, Anderson, & Elte, 2021),
restrictions on travel, and face-to-face meetings also reportedly impacted on efficiency, for example, time loss and financial
costs were incurred in digitizing face to face trainings for data collection and designing innovative remote trainings and data
collection techniques (ECW narrative report for period 01/2021 – 12/2021, p. 37).
B. To what extent and how the SoP ECW/MYRP’s processes and actors ensured that programme is designed
and delivered in a cost-efficient manner, and results achieved cost-effectively?
As noted above, there was a widespread view expressed in primary data findings that, given the circumstances, the design and
delivery had been cost effective – with ministry representatives explicitly stating this in KII engagements. However, this view was
not shared by all respondents. Key Informant Interviews with senior stakeholders did raise some concerns pertaining to efficiency,
with a specific focus on potential duplication of effort, and missed opportunities for alignment, and reduced cost-base, reflecting
broader concerns over coherence:
On cost effectiveness, I think there were some missed opportunities to work towards joint results – every implementing
agency was working towards its own results. This has an impact on cost-efficiency, due to missed opportunities. For
example, there were two agencies procuring [computer] tablets, in light of emerging needs, due to online modality, etc. This
doesn’t really make sense – we could have had one agency procuring, rather than having two parallel procurement
processes.
SENIOR KII STAKEHOLDER, FEMALE
This was echoed by a range of other respondents, particularly within UN agencies, who raised specific concerns over a
‘fragmented’ approach to programming, undermining the efficiency of interventions.
Quantitative analysis of primary data similarly reflects a range of perspectives in relation to the use of resources, with generally
positive responses in relation to most programming, with specific reservations expressed in relation to some modalities (with
occasional demographic disparities between male and female respondents):
Figure 12: Proportion of respondents agreeing that resources were used well, by modality [Gaza Strip]

In the Gaza Strip, there were no respondents who participated in the Arabic/ Maths Camps dimension of support who denied
that the resources were well-used; rather, the beneficiary group had a much higher rate of ‘I don’t know’ responses, indicating
that the cost of materials used in the games and activities comprising the camp sessions were not made clear to the participants.
Abstentions further account for the majority of underperformance across the remaining modalities of support in the Gaza Strip.
For this reason, the above data may best be understood as a relative metric for the transparency of resource use across
programme areas, rather than the (in)efficient use of such resources.

While abstentions account for a reasonable proportion of underperformance against this metric amongst West Bank programme
modalities, 14 out of 16 respondents across the beneficiary survey dataset who thought that resources were not used well were
from the West Bank. Underperformance of the objectives of the support accounted for some of this. For example, one
respondent indicated that internet support would have made good use of funds if the resulting speed and reach of the school’s
connection were better. Elsewhere, children objected fundamentally to the use of MYRP resources for games for studying rather
than convention classroom delivery of content, insofar as they felt that money given towards formal lessons would have
represented a better use of resources.

In explanation of those who believed that financial resources were wasted: for cleaning materials, there was a concern that
students took surplus masks and hand sanitiser home for domestic use. However, this was uncorroborated by other reports
from those involved. For the remaining modalities, while some responses did indicate a belief that funds had been wasted, all
explanations of this response indicated that the relevant student had misunderstood the question asked, and provided no
evidence of financial mismanagement.
Owing to widespread confusion over the scope of this question amongst respondents from the West Bank, the corresponding
table of findings has been omitted. In reference to justifications for genuine beliefs over waste of financial resources by a small
minority of respondents, the complaints over the inappropriateness of using games for teaching were adduced again (as cited
above regarding financial efficiency). In addition, one beneficiary noted that provision of warm winter clothing would have
represented a more efficient use of money than in-school games and similar interactive activities, insofar as the latter represent
a nice-to-have, rather than a necessity.
C. How are SoP ECW/MYRP processes and actors balancing speed and quality of its design and delivery?
There was a widespread view expressed in response to primary research engagements, that the MYRP had been initiated in a
timely manner, but that COVID-related delays had led to a series of ‘knock-on’ delays, impacting on timeliness overall:
In terms of timeliness, the first part of the MYRP was timely; the reprogramming after COVID, and escalation in May, it took
some time to work through. This delayed implementation, which had a snowball effect on 2021 and 2022. There was
therefore a 6-month extension.
SENIOR KII STAKEHOLDER, FEMALE
EQ5: To what extent and how has the SoP ECW/MYRP created political commitment to
address the needs of children and youth (boys/girls) affected by conflict and crisis on a global
and in-country level?
The MYRP has garnered significant political commitment from domestic leadership in the State of Palestine. This is most clearly
expressed in the MoE’s leading role in the MYRP’s governance structure, where the Minister of Education is co-chair of the
Steering Committee (SC) and a senior MoE official from the MoE’s ECW Core team is the co-chair of the Technical Committee
| 31 |
(TC) (ECW narrative report for period 01/2020 – 12/2020, 2021). Since December 2019 the MoE has taken a series of steps
to affirm and consolidate its role in ECW/MYRP governance. These include creating a team of 6 officials to liaise with the MYRP’s
PMU on management issues, and fostering communication between MoE officials and the SC and TC by bringing 6 and 11
officials to them respectively (ECW narrative report for period 01/2020 – 12/2020, 2021). During 2021 the technical meetings
including the Y3 reprogramming exercise had MoE officials at the core of discussions. The MoE’s Deputy Minister led the
exercise with the PMU and all five MYRP partners involved (ECW narrative report for period 01/2021 – 12/2021, 2022). UNICEF
SoP’s most recent narrative report to ECW states that this political commitment has helped ensure ‘solid technical discussions
and better information flow within the Ministry and with the ECW partners’ (ECW narrative report for period 01/2021 – 12/2021,
2022, p. 14).
The MYRP has also enhanced MoE’s commitment to protecting children’s rights to educational continuity and participation in
safe learning environments. This is evidenced by the discourse of rights and endorsement of international standards in post
policies developed such as the Inclusive Education Policy, the School Environment Policy, the Joint Advocacy and Protection
Strategy (JPAS), the Education Sector Contingency Plan, and its Education Sector Strategic Plan (2017-2022) (ECW narrative
report for period 01/2020 – 12/2020, 2021). However, the PMU of implementing partners report to ECW that the MoE still
requires an institutionalized coordinated approach towards EiE to monitor vulnerabilities and ensure cohesive responses in all
phases of emergency prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery (Ibid.)
Furthermore, MoE has played a proactive leadership role, appointing a dedicated focal person, reorganising the governance
structure, and providing an office space to PMU for effective coordination and decision making, such as identification of priority
needs for allocation of ‘Flexible Funds’.

4.4 Effectiveness
Effectiveness refers to the extent to which the intervention achieved its objectives and results across different beneficiary groups.
This section addresses the SoP ECW/MYRP’s contribution to mobilizing and leveraging funds at country level, strengthening a
joint approach to EiEPC programming, strengthening country and local capacities, strengthening quality data, and the progress
made towards the different collective beneficiary results as identified in the country result frameworks.
Findings from primary research reflect reportedly positive views of the extent to which MYRP was used to mobilize funds for the
COVID response. It does not appear that the ECW/MYRP was effective in contributing directly and/or indirectly to mobilizing
and leveraging broader funds at country level.
EQ6: To what extent and how has the SoP ECW/MYRP contributed directly &/or indirectly to
mobilizing and leveraging funds at country level? How can the MYRPs be strengthened in this
regard?
Respondents were largely positive in their view of the extent to which the MYRP was used to mobilize funds for the COVID
response. Ministry officials noted that this was particularly the case in relation to WASH related programming. Stakeholders in
the Gaza Strip reflected this noted the following:
We requested a change for the COVID-19 and Gaza Strip Flexible Fund – which was guaranteed very promptly – to raise an
order their response was within a week – very impressed with their response to emergency need.
UN AGENCY KII, MALE
In this context, the impact on ‘school rehabilitation [and] school adaptation’ was highlighted as an area of particular strength.
With regard to leveraging seed funds to generate broader funding, it was suggested by some stakeholders that opportunities
had been missed. While ECW seed funding has proved to be flexible and accessible for dynamic targeting, it has not functioned
as a catalyst for mobilizing and leveraging funds at country level. Rather, the SoP MYRP funding allocations plan for over 50%
of all MYRP related programming to be funded by ECW (see figure below).
Financial analysis of the MYRP programming shows that out of the overall budget of $35 million, ECW provided programming
with $18 million worth of ‘catalytic seed funding’. However, no other modality of funding for the MYRP was recorded (MYRP
Implementing Partners, 2022). In the narrative reports of MYPR implementing partners to ECW, the aforementioned one-off
example of UNICEF SoP and SCI’s raising US$850,000 to support the MYRP COVID-19 response plan is noted (ECW narrative
report for period 01/2021 – 12/2021, 2022). It is further mentioned that SCI supported a needs assessment of school disaster
management committees in 30 vulnerable schools through other funds (ECW narrative report for period 01/2021 – 12/2021,
2022, p. 13). The rare occurrences of non-ECW funds being raised, and cases exclusively consisting of iNGO implementing
partners raising funds, suggests an underperformance of the MYRP in raising and leveraging funds at the country level – as
such, it does not appear that the ECW/MYRP was effective in contributing directly and/or indirectly to mobilizing and leveraging
funds at country level.
Figure 15: Seed funding as a share of total MYRP cost, by MYRP country
(VENALAINEN, ANDERSON, & ELTE, 2021, P. 76)
| 33 |
A lack of coordination was cited by some UN agency stakeholders as a factor potentially undermining alignment of ECW/MYRP
activities with other sources of in-country funding. This relates to related concerns voiced over the extent to which the
establishment of partnerships, and, specifically, the emergence of an effective localization agenda, has been successful:
I am not very impressed by the partnership angle of the MYRP – for example, the Ministry did not necessarily understand the
nature of the programme, saw it more as a project than a programme. Now, with the new phase, they are starting to
understand the importance of it, and viewing it more as a strategic partnership. Between implementing agencies, there was
limited partnership, everyone was working on their own interventions, I am not sure this has been strengthened. I don’t think
this is a point to be highlighted as positive. There is, of course, potential.

Likewise, a review of sentiment analysis scores pertaining to effectiveness suggest a varied level of perceived efficacy:

Nonetheless, MYRP stakeholders and partners have shown intention to collaborate in mobilizing national resources, which has
become a key focus of the Steering Committee and Partners Group/Heads of Partner Agencies (ECW narrative report for period
01/2021 – 12/2021, 2022). Information sharing has, and will continue to be, central to initiating national resource mobilisation.
For example, as part of the COVID-19 response, UNDP assisted the MoE to conduct a needs assessment for WASH priorities
in East Jerusalem. The resultant clear mapping of 127 schools accelerated the MoE’s mobilisation of the resources required to
ensure the safe return of students for the 2021/22 school year. This in turn facilitated the joint work of UNDP and the MoE to
improve WASH facilities in the schools and informed the MoE’s Back to School plan for East Jerusalem schools which was
aligned with MYRP priorities (Ibid.)
EQ7: To what extent and how did the SoP ECW/MYRP promote and strengthen a joint,
(humanitarian-development) coordinated, evidence-based, and inclusive approach to EiEPC
programming in the State of Palestine? How can these aspects be strengthened in MYRP?
The narrative reports analysed in this investigation’s desk review outline various contexts in which the SoP ECW/MYRP upheld
evidence-based joint EiEPC programming in SoP, underpinned by effective coordination between partners. For instance, the
ECW Narrative Report for 2021 describes how the UNDP and the MoE coordinated their activities to undertake joint
infrastructure needs assessments in 127 Agwaf and private schools located in east Jerusalem between September 2020 and
February 2021 (ECW narrative report for period 01/2021 – 12/2021, 2022). The same narrative report also details similar
collaborations between these two stakeholders (UNDP and the MoE) in developing and delivering the Ministry’s ‘Back-to-School’
plan in East Jerusalem. In addition to their collaborations with UNDP, the MoE also completed joint programming with UNESCO,
which included the ‘Distance Learning’ task team, which managed the various remote education interventions undertaken by
task team members and supporting organisations.
UNESCO also supported the MoE’s ‘Quality Education’ thematic group, which sought to bridge the learning loss gaps which
students incurred as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns (ECW narrative report for period 01/2020 – 12/2020, 2021).
| 34 |
Lastly, Save the Children led the ‘MHPSS Taskforce’, which specifically focused on supporting the common approach fostered
by the ECW/MYRP to build stronger partnerships between PSS providers and the MOE. The interventions related to PPS were
largely successful, which was enabled by the Taskforce’s efforts to support effective coordination, as well as resource
mobilisation and material exchanges between relevant partners (Ibid.)
With regard to using evidence bases to support effective programming, the primary lacunae identified in this evaluation was the
lack of available baseline data at the outset of the programme’s planning and inception phases. As noted by respondents in the
key informant interviews, the baseline for the MYRP was delayed, and was not completed until after the MYRP’s designing and
planning stages, and even after the implementation of the MYRP had started. As a result, baseline data and relevant comparative
data on response preparedness and recovery strategies were lacking in the programme’s development phase, and could not
be used as an evidence base to inform the targeting of activities.
This deficit in available baseline data and findings was noted in the narrative reporting, with ECW/MYRP partners reportedly
advocating for evidence-based education planning which considers the causes and triggers of conflict In 2021, a series of
approaches for achieving a wider evidence base were strategized (ECW narrative report for period 01/2021 – 12/2021, 2022).
These are included in Annex 16.
A. How was the MYRP used to mobilize funds for the COVID response?
Once the COVID-crisis hit the State of Palestine, substantial effort was put toward pivoting MYRP seed funds toward support
for children suffering due to the crisis. This included the myriad activities described in other sections of this report, including
support for distance learning, provision of hygiene materials, etc.; by the end of the programme, a substantial proportion (if not
a plurality) of delivery was targeted at addressing COVID-specific challenges. Consequently, use of ECW’s Seed Funding, which
was supplemented by additional emergency funds from ECW, was highly targeted toward responding to the COVID crisis.
B. To what extent are the ECW seed funds complementing the additional generated SoP ECW/MYRP funding,
if any?
C. If in-country resources were mobilized, to what extent are these joint efforts addressing needs sufficiently
and effectively? If no in-country resources were mobilized, why not and how this can be improved? To what
extent are the ECW seed funds complementing the additional generated SoP ECW/MYRP funding, if any?
D. If no in-country resources were mobilized, why not and how this can be improved?
Stakeholders noted that UNICEF led a school hygiene taskforce in response to the Covid pandemic, leveraging the MYRP
funding and mobilising resources from Education partners to provide school hygiene kits to all schools. Additionally, stakeholders
noted that the PMU developed a resources mobilization plan, which included mapping of the main donors in SoP in 2021.
However, it does not appear that any additional international or national resources were mobilised in support of the broader
MYRP, nor does it appear that seed funds contributed toward generation of additional funds specifically for MYRP
implementation. In fact, the opposite appears to be the case in the State of Palestine: Seed Funds largely contributed toward
other programmes, priorities, and activities defined by the myriad implementing partners. This challenge has been described at
length in other sections of the report; it does appear that this inversion of mobilisation (i.e. that Seed Funds were mobilised to
other strategies and priorities, rather than vice versa) resulted in the dilution of perceivable or discernible impact arising from
ECW's support.
E. To what extent are the SoP ECW/MYRP approaches replicable &/or scalable to other conflict/crisis affected
areas in the country?
Given the dilution of response, and the integration of Seed Fund and MYRP activities into broader development and formal-
school driven interventions in SoP, much of the implementation seems to have fallen out of alignment with ECW’s shifting
strategies and approaches over the last 4-5 years; namely, focus on EiE- and nexus-specific, rather than more development-
focussed programming has come to drive prioritisation of MYRP activity. As such, it does not appear that many of the activities
implemented by this round of the MYRP in SoP are relevant in other countries.
The primary exception to this is the support provided to detained children; this is a growing issue in other countries (both in the
MENA region, and in others – see Iraq and Syria), and the lessons gained through MYRP’s support for these young people may
be instructive in other countries. Another exception is the response to the Covid emergency, with MYRP funds quickly
reprogrammed for Covid response.

F. To what extent and how is accountability to affected populations considered in the SoP ECW/MYRP, and
how can this be strengthened?
Minimal documentation exists regarding efforts by implementing partners to be accountable to beneficiaries. Many partner
representatives, during interviews, mentioned informal approaches taken to engaging with beneficiaries and government
officials to ensure implementation aligned to their needs and was accountable to national stakeholders. However, these efforts
were not systematically documented, nor did they result in any systematic MEAL data allowing for clear analyses and
conclusions. Consequently, it is difficult to establish with any degree of certainty how accountable the programme really was. If
any documentation was collated on mechanisms of AAP/PSEA present within context, this has not been shared with the
evaluation team.
Furthermore, challenges mentioned by government and international partners regarding the approach taken to programme
design and implementation (i.e. that activities were designed with limited needs assessment, and at times limited engagement
with government stakeholders) may have posed additional issues with regard to strong accountability of programming.
G. To what extent are local organizations involved in the planning, implementation/monitoring, and redesign of
the SoP ECW/MYRP?
As noted in narrative reporting, the ECW/MYRP engaged local partners in developing a digitalized results-based Monitoring,
Evaluation, Accountability, and Learning (MEAL) system for Save the Children and its local collaborators. The different interfaces
on this system have enabled the building of logical frameworks that feed into a comprehensive and collaborative system (ECW
narrative report for period 01/2021 – 12/2021, 2022).
EQ8: To what extent and how did the SoP ECW/MYRP strengthen country and local capacities
at individual, organizational and institutional levels for improved EiEPC programming? How can
the MYRPs be strengthened in this regard?
A. To what extent and how did the SoP ECW/MYRP facilitate new and strengthen existing partnerships?
Participant organisations (principally primary and secondary schools) were very positive regarding the role of the MYRP
programming they received in building partnership capacity between themselves and other organisations. This overall positive
reflection is exhibited in the statistical data provided below, as well as several quotes from teachers during their survey responses.
Some teachers highlight that the MYRP has strengthened partnerships by clearly establishing needs, for example MYRP
assessments during COVID-19 inspiring partners to be more generous with their provisions of technologies for distance learning:
Some entities are still supporting the project by donating laptops and tablets.
TEACHER SURVEY RESPONDENT
Others note the web of connections the MYRP created, drawing attention to the quantity of institutions they had the chance to
work with as a result of the programming:
[The programme has improved partnerships] with local institutions, institutes, and schools. We have worked in partnership
with more than one vocational education institution, teachers, and municipalities.
TEACHER SURVEY RESPONDENT
Positive views of the chance to work with communities was also expressed. One teacher explained that communities exhibiting
their ideas for better education provision helped them to improve the quality of their partnerships and services:
[During the MYRP] the local community was participating in ideas, looking at them and participating in exhibitions, as it builds
new partnerships that are beneficial to us.
TEACHER SURVEY RESPONDENT
Others stated more directly that partnerships encouraged by MYRP interventions were strong and beneficial to the quality of
education provision they could deliver:
| 36 |
Indeed, the intervention contributed [to improving local partnership] and there are other partnerships, such as the My Right to
Play Foundation, and there is a merger in the provision of educational services in order to reach a better educational level.
TEACHER SURVEY RESPONDENT
It also to be noted that a non-negligible quantity of teachers also answered positively because they believed the programming
improved relationships between themselves and other members of their own institution (including teachers, students, and
departments). For example, one respondent explained that partnerships between male and female students within their school
had improved as a result of MYRP programming:
Partnerships between the school and other schools, as well as between male and female students, have been improved.
TEACHER SURVEY RESPONDENT
Another teacher noted that energies channelled into the partnerships with external organisations made possible by the MYRP
induced new collaborations within their institution:
[Our school is] currently participating with the My Right to Play Foundation and [the intervention] has helped to establish new
internal partnerships.
TEACHER SURVEY RESPONDENT
The overall positive sentiment that the MYRP facilitated new and strengthened existing partnerships is also broadly reflected in
quantitative data garnered from primary research in the course of this evaluation:
Figure 17: Proportion of teachers agreeing that their modality of support facilitated new, or strengthened existing, (local) partnerships [Gaza
Strip]
Additional Learning Needs Support (Student Stationery) 89%
Arabic and Maths Self-Learning 88%
Science and IT Learning Kits 100%
In the Gaza Strip, respondents across the modalities of support identified both the MoE and My Right to Play as key groups with
whom their relationships had been strengthened as a result of participation in this programme. Other external partners, including
CSOs and foreign partnerships were reported by teachers, but further names of partner organisations were not forthcoming.
Regarding those respondents in both Arabic and Maths Self-Learning and Additional Learning Needs Support who did not
identify new partnerships supported/strengthened as a result of the intervention, no explanations were offered. This suggests
that the respondents did not have an unmet expectation that such collaborative benefits would be secured through programming.

| 37 |
In the West Bank, local organisations supporting with the provision of learning resources to target schools (including the donation
of laptops and tablets) were identified by a number of respondents who agreed that such partnerships had been strengthened
through participation in the programme. However, no names of partner organisation were supplied by respondents.
Nevertheless, for all intervention modalities, the majority of respondents agreed that this wider dimension of collaborative
engagement had been supported through the MYRP. As with respondents in the Gaza Strip, there was no clear expectation
amongst those who did not report strengthened institutional ties that such support should have been offered according to the
scope of support they had received.
Specific examples of where partnerships have been strengthened or created are documented in the MYRP partners’ narrative
reports to ECW. The partners’ response to COVID-19 is noted to have strengthened partnership between the MoE and the
iNGO community. The EWC/MYRP fund was the quickest to reprogramme and ‘pivot’ assistance to the MoE’s COVID-19
response, a demonstration of flexibility underpinned by strong communication and trust (ECW narrative report for period
01/2020 – 12/2020, 2021). Moreover, UNDP’s close work with the MoE in identifying potential schools for Y3 interventions,
particularly in Area C, has helped to expand options for MoE-iNGO partnership in the area of technical assessment and mapping
(ECW narrative report for period 01/2021 – 12/2021, 2022).
However, the PMU’s most recent narrative report to ECW notes that delivering on their ‘Common Approaches’ framework,
which intends to leverage the comparative advantages offered by all local and international partners, will require additional funds
(Ibid.).
B. How have the partnerships contributed to effective delivery of programme?
MYRP capacity-building activities have helped to facilitate and strengthen partnerships between grantees, IPs, and government
partners, which are further deepened through joint planning and coordination processes. These elements of the MYRP
objectives have been mutually beneficial and positively reinforcing with respect to effectiveness. Strengthened partnerships and
better data further strengthen joint and evidence-based planning and coordination, and help to build the capacity of national
education systems (Venalainen, Anderson, & Elte, 2021).
The functioning of the PMU within UNICEF SoP is a deliberative practice to ensure a separate and ‘independent’ management
body of different partners. This also supported the ‘whole-of-child’ joint programming approach and elevated the programme to
a more comprehensive approach than ‘the sum of its parts’ (ECW narrative report for period 01/2020 – 12/2020, 2021).
The PMU has been fully operational since 2020 and coordinated all joint exercises related to programme planning, baseline and
needs assessment study, reprogramming for COVID-19, partners’ emergency reprogramming requests, and secured Y3 seed
funds followed by a thorough reprogramming exercise led jointly with the MoE. Moreover, the PMU, in cooperation with the
Education Cluster, led the programming of Gaza Strip flexible funds, in addition to the regular management of reporting, M&E,
financial, compliance and risk, governance, donor relations; communication/visibility and resource mobilization. (ECW narrative
report for period 01/2020 – 12/2020, 2021)
Some partners also learnt that having the MoE lead the implementation provided both opportunities as well as bottlenecks. Such
Partnership with the MoE created opportunities for systemic and large-scale results beyond what the ECW MYRP funding could
achieve. For example, with MoE leading the COVID-19 Hygiene task force, resources were mobilized to provide school hygiene
kits to all government schools. On the other hand, it was difficult to make the needed progress with the distance learning
component (ECW narrative report for period 01/2020 – 12/2020, 2021).
DEAL is an example of where partnerships have worked. The virtual platform, which helps adolescents to develop life skills,
supported an estimated 8,061 grade 7-9 adolescents (5,105 F, 2,956M) by the end of 2021 (ECW narrative report for period
01/2021 – 12/2021, 2022). These students were trained and supported on how to use the platform to improve their Life Skills
and Citizenship Education in partnership with a local NGO and in close coordination with the MoE.
EQ9: To what extent and how did the SoP ECW/MYRP promote and strengthen: (i) the
availability of quality data on education needs/gaps in SoP, and (ii) the measurement of output
and outcome results? How can the MYRPs be strengthened in this regard?
While rich baseline data was developed in support of the MYRP, which provides a range of insight into areas of particular need,
and ongoing gaps to be addressed, this was developed (due to delays in contracting) after MYRP design was undertaken, while
implementation was underway. It appears that baseline data therefore did not inform programming, nor was follow-up data
garnered on key indicators set out therein.
| 38 |
As such, no evidence has been identified of a systematic interlinking of school level (and national) assessment data on learning
outcomes to the planning and monitoring of interventions. This is a key area of priority to ensure:
i. An evidence-based approach to future programming;
ii. Improved Monitoring and Evaluation, allowing for a more granulated appraisal of impact on beneficiaries; and
iii. Improved accountability, and utility of resources, in light of the above.
These areas of concern with the availability of quality data were further expanded in the narrative reporting. For instance, during
the Covid-19 pandemic, missing data about schooling, as well as a lacking information management tool for collecting and
analysing this data, represented a considerable challenge in exploring the best options and opportunities in responding to the
MoE’s education needs (ECW narrative report for period 01/2020 – 12/2020, 2021). Therefore, it is important to enhance MoE’s
capacities for data collection and real-time information management, which could be achieved through investment in developing
or strengthening the MoE’s databases and education management information systems (ECW narrative report for period
01/2020 – 12/2020, 2021).
An additional, significant challenge faced in designing and implementing the programme, was the lack of disaggregated, credible,
and up-to-date data to inform relevant response, preparedness, and recovery strategies, as well as providing ongoing
monitoring of impacts incurred by implemented activities (ECW narrative report for period 01/2020 – 12/2020, 2021). It was on
the basis of this shortcoming that ECW/MYRP partners noted the need for additional evidence bases, which could be used to
underpin education programming and planning which is coherent with the causes and triggers of conflict, and reflects how this
conflict evolves and impacts on wider programming (Ibid.).
Despite these challenges with lacking baseline evidence and information to support the planning and implementation of
education programming, certain key strengths and critical achievements were nevertheless observed with respect to increasing
availability of data and capacities for data collection and management. The MYRP modality increased awareness and available
data on access and learning outcomes for IDPs, refugees, and other vulnerable groups, as well as promoting and strengthening
the availability of EiEPC data in MYRP countries (Venalainen, Anderson, & Elte, 2021).
Additionally, an ECW narrative report highlights the training of 442 staff members (265 women,177 men) on EMIS data collection
(UNRWA WB) (ECW narrative report for period 01/2021 – 12/2021, 2022).
Through the recruitment of five field data collectors, one of the programme’s local partners was able to ensure the correct
documentation of violations in and around schools (ECW narrative report for period 01/2021 – 12/2021, 2022). A summary of
these processes, as reported in the narrative report, is listed in Annex 16.
To capture ECW/MYRP direct contributions, the PMU followed up with MYRP partners on measuring the results of several major
interventions related to improved and safe access to education.
The already collected data on assistive devices needed for CwD can be used to inform further resource mobilization to ensure
that CwD are receiving quality education and that no one is left behind (SoP ECW/MYRP Outcome 1, Output 1.3). (ECW
narrative report for period 01/2021 – 12/2021, 2022)
The PMU strengthened joint programming and M&E knowledge sharing by conducting joint field visits and sharing with MoE
and partners online training courses and knowledge initiatives/products (ECW narrative report for period 01/2021 – 12/2021,
2022). The PMU works with the five partners on strengthening capacities through regular orientation sessions on topics such
as risk, M&E and financial management, and gender. Joint participatory monitoring activities and reflection sessions enhance
the understanding, collection, and use of evidence-based data to inform responses that are relevant, efficient, effective, and
more sustainable (Ibid.). The PMU also coordinates the SoP ECW/MYRP data management with all five MYRP partners. This
includes field visits, data orientations sessions, designing, administrating and/or supporting MYRP partners to conduct outputs
and outcomes level surveys which inform results’ reporting (Ibid.).
A Task Force comprised of staff from all relevant departments in the MoE was formed to monitor the implementation of the
DEAL intervention. An evaluation of the DEAL program was conducted by the Task Force and the report of the evaluation is
currently under review on whether DEAL should be integrated into the MoE e- education portal (Ibid.).
Employing innovative remote trainings and data collection techniques, including Open Data Kit (ODK) to overcome COVID-19
challenges proved to be efficient and a better option than to stop organizing any trainings and data collection. However, the
training material on inclusive education was prepared for face-to-face training. Due to COVID-19, it took the implementing
partner UNESCO some time to digitize it, which caused some delays, and increased costs. Moreover, online training modality
was the preferred option by the MoE.

Accountability to Affected Populations
Despite the recruitment and training of field collectors, and local capacity strengthening for the measurement of MYRP
outcomes, not all beneficiaries felt data collection captured their input:
Figure 19: Proportion of respondents who were able to give feedback on their intervention(s)' effectiveness [Gaza Strip]

Owing to the time elapsed between final evaluation and beneficiaries’ receipt of support through the MYRP’s supported
interventions, a third of respondents (32.9%) in the Gaza Strip were unable to remember whether feedback mechanisms were
made available to them during the programme. Amongst those who were able to recall a focal point to contact about providing
programme feedback, almost all identified their teacher as the relevant contact point (no other named professional role was
reported by respondents as an appropriate point of contact). In this context, the data above largely reflects the time elapsed
between participation in the survey and benefit from the programme, rather than the adequacy of accountability mechanisms
provided.

For those in West Bank who denied having the option to provide feedback, almost all explained this view by reporting that they
were not explicitly asked for their views on the quality and appropriateness of support provided. (Unlike in the Gaza Strip, in no
case did the respondents who denied being able to give feedback claim that they were unable to recall as a reason for their
response to this question). Overall, abstentions accounted for only 12% of underperformance against this metric across all
modalities. Similarly, for those who identified opportunities to provide feedback, the majority described the active solicitation of
feedback from those running activities or lessons which employed materials supported by the MYRP. For example, one
beneficiary noted that ‘the teacher always asked us if we liked the games, and they asked us [further feedback questions] if
they were on Zoom and WhatsApp,’ while another – describing support for in-person learning – noted that ‘[a]fter each activity,
[they] sat down and evaluated the activity, its objectives, and mistakes’. As the data above demonstrates, this dimension of
active accountability was not integrated into the summer camps supported by the MYRP.
EQ10: What is the progress made towards the different collective beneficiary results as
identified in the country result frameworks (access, continuity, equity and gender equality,
quality and learning, safety)? How can the MYRP be strengthened in this regard?
A. To what extent and how is the SoP ECW/MYRP implementing a comprehensive multi-faceted packaged
response so as to ensure continued access to safe quality education and improve life skills learning
outcomes for children?
Teachers in schools received a variety of support, often multi-faceted and packaged, from infrastructural rebuilding to extra
resources for their classrooms. One example that reveals the multi-faceted and flexible nature of MYRP programming is UNDP’s
utilisation of MYRP funds to enhance access to safe education through transport provision. Although only rolled out on a local
scale, 65 children benefited from UNDP’s safe and reliable transportation services to and from schools (ECW narrative report
for period 01/2021 – 12/2021, p. 5).
| 40 |
Where infrastructural improvements were made, teachers often acknowledged their role in ensuring access to safe and quality
education. For example, one teacher mentioned in their final comments to their enumerator that a lack of sewage had been
creating problems for children’s safe access to learning, but were resolved through MYRP programming.
Feedback on classroom resources and toolkits given to teachers to aid their pedagogy was also overwhelmingly positive. For
example, one teacher noted that MYRP-provided teacher toolkits helped save time and effort for teachers. They explain that the
tools thereby allowed them to provide better life skill learning outcomes for their students by introducing diverse activities ‘for
society’ to their classroom.
MYRP programming indirectly enhancing education quality by strengthening students’ enjoyment of learning was a recurring
theme in responses discussing the feature of learning materials in the packaged responses of MYRP programming. One teacher
pointed to stationery provision as an example of a material that induced such a knock on effect, limiting ‘the phenomenon of
dropout due to the lack of stationery’.
These views on the effectiveness of intervention modalities are corroborated largely by those advanced by direct beneficiaries
(see figure below). Countervailing opinions amongst certain demographic groups are provided below, as well as quantitative
insight into the proportion of satisfaction with programmatic effectiveness across beneficiaries of different programme modalities.
Figure 21: Word cloud denoting the most frequently occurring words used by beneficiaries to describe the overall effect of the MYRP
programming they were served by
B. To what extent and how has the MYRP taken equity considerations for different genders, the disabled and
other marginalized population groups into account, and how can the MYRP be strengthened in this regard?
Beneficiaries were asked to reflect on equity considerations through questions of whether MYRP related interventions reached
the needs of those who needed it most. Most respondents indicated that they felt MYRP programming was equitable in this
regard:

The only two reasons provided for why the relevant intervention stream did not meet the needs of those who needed it most in
the Gaza Strip were provided by one recipient of stationery and one participant in the Arabic/ Maths camps, both of whom
reported that not all students in all classes were able to participate in the relevant dimension of support, for which reason there
were some children thought to be at least as in-need as beneficiaries who were not able to take part. The underperformance
against this metric across remaining project dimensions come from abstentions of respondents, suggesting that almost all
respondents across all project modalities were satisfied that their respective intervention adequately supported those most in
need.

In the West Bank, all respondents reporting that the intervention did not meet the needs of those who needed it most justified
this view by stating that there was room to further tailor the intervention target beneficiary group towards individual need. As a
consequence, these respondents felt that many who did not qualify as most in-need nonetheless received what was seen as
gratuitous support. For example, one beneficiary of game-based learning reported that the students ‘can understand with or
without a game, and can solve [set problems] with or without [Microsoft] Teams’. Furthermore, amongst beneficiaries of
distributed laptops and tablets, students reported that some students used them for non-educational purposes, and that others
did not need the devices to begin with. These comments – rather than justifying opinions against the intervention meeting the
needs of those most in-need – instead provide evidence of scope for further tailoring the intervention to ensure only those in
need receive relevant support. It should be noted that those disagreeing with this question represent only 63% of
underperformance recorded above, with the remainder comprised of those abstaining from answering on the grounds of not
knowing enough to confirm or deny the view.

The data above show a significantly greater geography-based difference in satisfaction over the intervention meeting community
needs than a gendered division in the outcomes. This may in part be attributed to the fact that modalities of MYRP-funded
support differed on a geographical basis, with only cleaning materials (female beneficiaries only) and ex-detainee multi-sectoral
support (almost exclusively male) demonstrating clear gendered differences. For this reason, these data evidence differences
in the degree to which Gaza Strip-implemented and West Bank-implemented programming effectively encompassed
community-level priorities. The modality breakdowns of responses provided for both geographies below provide insight into the
causes for this disparate performance.

In the Gaza Strip, all respondents who provided a reason for denying that the support provided met their communities needs
identified the insufficiency – rather than the irrelevance – of programming as the key concern. Many more respondents in receipt
of stationery (learning needs) than any other modality of support espoused such a view, identifying that the pens, rulers, erasers,
and sketchbook provided under the MYRP could not last for a full year, and once they were finished those too poor to afford
stationery would still be unable to do so. Nevertheless, the majority of respondents recognised the importance of children’s safe
return to school and access to quality education both remotely and in person as constitutive of wider community interests in
supporting well-educated and well-protected children against both protection and economic externalities.

The vast majority of respondents across all modalities of MYRP-funded support in the West Bank agreed that their community’s
needs were adequately met through the support received, with only 5 respondents providing reasons against this view. Again,
concerns over the relevance of games in education were raised, with others who received support for distance learning
expressing doubts over whether it was in the students’ interests to undertake learning remotely as opposed to in-person
provision. Amongst the majority who agreed that the intervention did adequately respond to community needs, reasons adduced
varied by intervention type, with the growing technological competency requirements of young people, community interest in
strengthened internet connection, general interests in an educated youth, and benefits of appropriately reformed ex-detainee
youth offenders all noted alongside in-school benefits of better equipped classrooms and more capable teachers.
C. Have there been any unintended positive or negative side effects on beneficiaries because of the support
provided under the MYRP; and if so, how was this dealt with by the grantees and implementing partners?
Key stakeholder interviews mention a variety of side effects induced by MYRP programming. For example, one programme
manager for a key implementing partner explained that a tension emerged between schools with names not agreed with by
some donors and the need to address vulnerabilities:
[The] naming of the schools is also a subject of controversy, if the name of the school is not accepted by the international
community.
KEY INFORMANT, UNDP MANAGER
Specifically, this relates to concerns on the part of donors in instances where schools are named after individuals who are, or
are viewed as by donors or others, terrorists, criminals, or parties involved in violent or unlawful activity.
This is consistent with MYRP implementation partners report to ECW in 2020 that reported this issue risks posing equity
challenges, with some schools not being able to receive assistance despite high needs (ECW narrative report for period 01/2020
– 12/2020, 2021, p. 21).
D. What unintended outcomes has the SoP ECW/MYRP produced?
Other unintended consequences or outcomes have been difficult to establish from the available data, especially given the dearth
of documentary evidence and MEAL data collected in the course of the programme. In a broader sense, it does appear that
learning from this programme has informed revisions to ECW and implementing partner thinking on how to structure and
implement MYRPs, as is evidenced by their new guidance and approach to MYRP development and penholder facilitation;
namely, that there is to be a much stronger emphasis on needs assessments and emergency-focussed programming, and
mandates to collect primary outcome-focussed evidence on learning, access, and equity directly from beneficiaries.
E. How and to what extent have contextual factors beyond the implementers’ control facilitated/hindered
achievement of SoP ECW/MYRP outcomes?
Further to the preceding analyses, COVID-19 seems to have been the biggest factor interrupting and hindering achievement of
outcomes. The MYRP did, indeed, pivot toward responding to the challenges arising from the crisis, but as with other MYRPs
implementation was substantially challenged. Conflagrations of conflict in the State of Palestine can hardly be considered
‘unexpected’, given how protracted the situation there is; consequently, partners did seem to be well prepared for, and
responsive to, relevant issues arising in the course of implementation.
4.5 Sustainability
Sustainability refers to the extent to which the benefits of the intervention are likely to continue. This section examines how the
SoP ECW/MYRP has been promoting and strengthening sustainable and resilient education systems and solutions.
| 43 |
As many of the modalities of support provided by the SoP MYRP focused on the provision of material support (COVID-oriented
PPE, cleaning supplies, stationery) and personal skills building (hygiene awareness, DRR knowledge, livelihood-oriented life
skills), sustainable capacity-building impacts received relatively less attention under this programme than within the context of
other MYRPs enacted elsewhere (particularly following the ‘pivot’ toward responses to lockdowns following the COVID-19
pandemic). Primary research suggests broadly positive perceptions of the sustainability of interventions, with the exception of
some female responses pertaining to Arabic and Maths Summer Camps, and self-learning.
EQ11: How is the SoP ECW/MYRP promoting and strengthening sustainable and resilient
education systems and solutions so far? How can it be strengthened in this regard?
A. To what extent did the SoP ECW/MYRP address longer term institutional/systemic change i.e. capacity
development, localization, standards (common approaches), system strengthening etc.?
Primary research findings suggest a range of reported sustainability impact arising from programming:
Insofar as many of the modalities of support provided by the SoP MYRP focused on the provision of material support (COVID-
oriented PPE, cleaning supplies, stationery) and personal skills building (hygiene awareness, DRR knowledge, livelihood-
oriented life skills), capacity-building impacts received relatively less attention under this programme than within the context of
other MYRPs enacted elsewhere. Major institutional-level outcomes of this MYRP include the skills of teachers to conduct
interactive lessons for their students as well as strengthened games-based skills; the IT capacities of schools in the West Bank
(the extent of the impact of which is to be evaluated through PDM of technology hardware); and the specialist skills of youth
workers (particularly those affiliated with NGO1) to offer holistic support to ex-detainees directed towards rehabilitation and
gainful reintegration into their community. Many of the other long-term benefits of MYRP programming are on an individual level.
Regarding localisation and standards, recommendations in the sphere of localisation have already been made under ‘Efficiency’
as they concern the indirect engagement of local CSOs and iNGOs via known, trusted, international consortium-member
organisations. Localisation – in the view of staff representing the latter kind of organisation – would be strengthened if direct
participation in MYRP were facilitated to a greater extent. This may include reducing the degree to which existing programming
skills and interests of iNGO operators shape the scope of proposed MYRP programming and engaging local organisation to
work on developing a capacity-sensitive procurement process which empowers smaller, local organisations to make proposals
which are competitive alongside larger locally-operative institutions.
Females became more able to influence, as there was [a] Cooperative Society for Women [supported by the programme].
[Collaboration between boys and girls increased because] games promote participation in play between the sexes.
[Non-gender-based programming was similarly effective for promoting gender relations because] through the distribution of
stationery in equal ways and the participation of both sexes in the same educational means, [the intervention] instilled the
principle of equality among students.
TEACHER SURVEYS
In some context, existing social norms perhaps preponderate too greatly for activities which are not actively transformative of
gender relations to achieve intended impact. This prompted one teacher to comment that ‘[t]here is no equality except for some
areas such as Ramallah and Bethlehem only. As for villages and camps, there is not much equality.’ This suggests that the
gender-transformative component of programming, when not the primary focus of the modality, is a result of the intervention
interacting with a process of societal change whose enabling conditions outrun those under the purview of the MYRP.
This understanding of societal change as dependent on a wider scale of societal engagement as targeted by the relevant
interventions is demonstrated by the praise given by NGO1 staff to such an approach to ex-detainee support. For one
psychologist at the organisation, the programme was successful because ‘[w]ork [was] also done with the families, and thus
the parents are prepared in the way to deal with the prisoners after their release, as well as the preparation of the school,
especially the guide on how to deal with the prisoner after his return to school.’ This view – if extrapolated – suggests that
similarly broad theories of change in other contexts may provide a way forward in terms of the sustainability of non-material
programming benefits.

In the Gaza Strip, views over the continuity of programming across programme modalities is relatively uniform across all forms
of support at c.80% approval across programming streams. The remaining c.20% of responses which were not in agreement
with this question reported that the length of the interventions mitigated the opportunity for the interventions to have long-term
effects. Similarly, for those receiving stationery (learning needs), concerns were again raised (as identified above) over the
longevity of notebooks, which were believed to last only a semester of school. For those who did identify long-term benefits of
programming, many of these were attributable to their ability to go back to school as a result of COVID-safe in-person conditions
and the learning gains they enjoyed while using the science/IT kits and/or stationery provided through the programme. Negative
views of the continuity of programming accounted for only 27% of underperformance against this metric, however, with the
remainder comprised of abstentions to the question.

In the West Bank, those who benefitted from the provision of DRR equipment, support with internet access at their skills, multi-
sectoral support for ex-detainees, and science/IT learning support were most likely to consider the benefits of programming
received to be sustainable. For learning-based outcomes, these benefits were particularly clear as respondents recognised that
they would be able to build on the knowledge gained through supported IT, mathematics, Arabic, or science lessons in the
context of their future academic work. Significantly, however, one in four participants in DEAL life skills did not report that they
thought the benefits of the ‘life’ skills learned would impact their future opportunities. Reasons given for this view were both
internal (for example, one respondent did not think that an engineering or programming profession would be a good fit for them)
as well as external (with one respondent alluding to poor economic conditions making support provided under the MYRP’s DEAL
life skills redundant). The only other reason provided against long-term benefits of programming (offered by a beneficiary of e-
learning equipment, self-learning materials for Arabic and Maths, COVID-safety materials, DRR equipment, and WASH
infrastructural rehabilitation) was that long-term benefits applied mainly to the beneficiary themselves, rather than continual
benefits for institutional support (although no evidence was offered for this claim). Negative views of the continuity of
programming accounted for only 31% of underperformance against this metric, however, with the remainder comprised of
abstentions to the question.
Figure 29: Word cloud of associations made by beneficiaries with the continuity of programme benefits
There was some concern amongst beneficiaries that
intervention dimensions which addressed acute challenges
induced by the pandemic – such as remote learning provision or
advice on personal safety directed specifically towards COVID-
sensitive behaviours – offered less in terms of transferable,
sustainable benefits. The following responses – as divided
demographically – provide an overview of the beliefs and
reasons given for perspectives over the sustainability of
programmatic benefits:
| 45 |
Positive Responses
Insofar as the intended benefits of the programme vary by modality, the reasons and views surrounding the sustainability thereof
similarly vary considerably. Overall, positive responses were typically offered surrounding those dimensions of support directed
towards either capacity building or non-consumable resource provision. An example of this relates to the provision of learning
resources for science lessons in the Gaza Strip, since classroom materials (such as scientific models) will remain available to
support the learning of future cohorts.
Similarly, benefits to beneficiaries’ attitude towards education were thought to be sustainable owing to the changes which this
mentality would bring about in how children continued to engage with educational opportunities, as well as the interpersonal
skills which children were able to develop more profoundly through MYRP-based programme support.
Material support for school reopening – insofar as it prevented long-term impacts from discontinuous learning – were thought
also to introduce sustainable benefits in their own way (although the means by which cleaning materials supported such longer-
lasting change were not clear to all beneficiaries):
The virus did not hinder the educational process due to sterilization and cleaning [provided under the MYRP], and therefore
we could continue with education and move on with our day-to-day life.
FEMALE BENEFICIARIES [WEST BANK]
Relevant programming supporting both institutional and individual capacities was similarly identified as likely to lead to long-term
positive benefits for recipients. This applies especially to DRR preparedness support for institutions vulnerable to conflict-related
insecurity, as preparedness comprised both institutional measures as well as increased awareness of appropriate DRR
behaviours amongst students at the relevant school.
Negative Responses
As a corollary to overall comments made about opinions favourable to the continuity of programme benefits, those interventions
which looked to support short-term material availability or COVID-specific educational issues were seen as less likely to produce
sustainable benefits for beneficiaries. This was particularly the case amongst those who received support with accessing remote
learning opportunities and subsequently returned to in-person education at school.
[The benefits of remote learning are not sustainable because] after it finished, we went back to learning in school, and they
cancelled e-learning.
FEMALE BENEFICIARY [GAZA STRIP]
Such scepticism over the long-term benefits of programming were echoed amongst those who received stationery alone through
the MYRP, which (in the course of ordinary in-person education) was likely to be used in its entirety within a short time span.
However, this view of the sustainability of such an intervention is likely to be an inevitable result of such a modality of support,
and as a result does not suggest a clear means of improving sustainability without further financial allocation to this dimension
of MYRP programming.
Similarly, for respondents considering the sustainability of project impacts for themselves – rather than future prospective
beneficiaries – the tailoring of support to individual curricular needs for specific age groups prompted certain student
beneficiaries to deny that they would be able to benefit from programme impacts after the end of programming.
[Curriculum-based learning support is not sustainable in its benefits because] books are limited to a specific class and are no
longer useful to them because they move to the next class.
FEMALE BENEFICIARIES [WEST BANK]
B. To what extent is it improving the resilience of the education system towards crisis settings in the SoP, and
what are the major success factors towards doing so?
Due to the limitations of data available, it is not possible to determine the specific impact of the programme on resilience to crisis
or conflict (which is already a very subtle, and difficult to define area). Integration in other larger responses and actions by the
high quantity of implementing partners, and resulting difficulty in discerning unique or differentiable impact, have much to do
| 46 |
with this. Similarly, the way in which the programme, and its linked activities, were intended to improve conflict resilience do not
appear to have been well defined from the outset, making it even harder to comment concretely on this research question.
C. To what extent has the SoP ECW/MYRP been conflict sensitive in its planning and implementation?
As mentioned in the previous sections, the partners are very experienced operating in the Palestinian conflict; consequently,
their ability to achieve output targets, even within a context of ongoing conflict, can be seen as commendable. However, with
the exception of support for detained children, ‘conflict sensitivity’ of design, planning, and of the individual interventions remains
unclear, given previously-discussed challenges relating to minimal documentation and MEAL evidence.
4.6 Cross-Cutting Themes
Cross-cutting themes refer to gender, age, disability, vulnerability, child and human rights, and accountability. This section
examines how these cross-cutting themes have been integrated in the programme.
Those designing the modalities of support comprising the SoP MYRP effectively identified many of the challenges facing
particular demographics of prospective beneficiaries either exclusively (less common) or to a greater extent than amongst other
demographics (more common). Evidence for this is distinct for each of the modalities insofar as the gender, age, and abilities
of target populations correspondingly differ. Respondents reported a gendered difference in outcomes owing to gender
disparities in the beneficiary cohort composition of certain modalities, in particular a range of risks affecting girls in their
communities were identified by West Bank respondents as potentially alleviated through participation in constituent programme
modalities. While much support appears to have targeted the most marginalised, due to lack of documentary evidence, the
degree to which these groups were served remains a challenge to concretely establish.
EQ12: To what extent have cross-cutting themes such as gender, age, disability, vulnerability,
child and human rights, and accountability been integrated in the programme?
A. To what extent has the programme addressed the needs of people of different genders, ages, and abilities?
Those designing the modalities of support comprising the SoP MYRP effectively identified many of the challenges facing
particular demographics of prospective beneficiaries either exclusively (less common) or to a greater extent than amongst other
demographics (more common). Evidence for this is distinct for each of the modalities insofar as the gender, age, and abilities
of target populations correspondingly differ. Building on responses offered by beneficiaries regarding why they believed their
inclusion was relevant for them, the following table addresses the key perceived dimensions of support tailoring as understood
by its recipients.7

identified key dimensions of their school and/or household context as likely reasons for the participation. Given the youth of many beneficiary respondents, this
range of a responses demonstrates a good transparency of programming on the part of the MYRP staff, as beneficiaries largely understood their position within
programmatic priorities for the country.

respondents were unclear as to whether targeting of this intervention was undertaken at the individual or
institutional level, since both such approaches were believed to have had similar de facto implementations.
Geography was identified as the most significant factor in the tailoring of this intervention to the needs of
affected populations. Namely, beneficiaries of this modality of support highlighted the remoteness of their
WASH Rehabilitation school in relation to key WASH infrastructure as a factor undergirding the relevance of the WASH
rehabilitation. Additionally, work on schools in Area C was considered well-tailored because of the difficulty
of other operators supporting school in such locations owing to security issues and conflict.
Cohort size, as well as total school population, were considered relevant factors informing the effective

Similar to responses provided addressing the effective tailoring of WASH rehabilitation needs to target
Internet Access populations, respondents identified the remoteness of their educational institutions as the key factor
informing the effective tailoring the intervention to beneficiary needs.
Safety Equipment Respondents reported that the location of target schools near to borders underlined the relevance of this
intervention to population needs as these locations were considered as more exposed to the threat of attack
(either directly or in the context of conflict taking place around the school building) than elsewhere in the
country.

other programming dimensions with which they were involved.

relevant to the population’s needs.
From a gendered perspective, analysis of all female responses received on the topic of MYRP relevance demonstrate a
favourable reception of programming content across all modalities of support. This is clear from the numerically positive
sentiment values recorded across all dimensions in the chart below (with the interval of respondent positivity ranging from [-1,1]

B. To what extent have the SoP ECW/MYRP interventions reduced gender, age, disability, geographical or
economic-based inequalities?
Further to the primary data garnered above, which provides a range of insights into gender considerations of programming, the
2020 Narrative Report provides a further degree of granularity with regard to the gender sensitive approach adopted, which
informed programming under the auspices of the MYRP (additional details can be found in Annexure 13).
The report provides evidence of effective collaboration between consortium partners, insofar as gender-based expertise as held
by Save the Children has been used to provide technical support to the wider programme modalities. Gender-based concerns
over the impact of COVID-19 on children during the pandemic – while significant – must be considered alongside the mediating
influence of parents’ competence and willingness to support at-home learning for children of both sexes, which affected
households with a lower level of education disproportionally (see discussion of COVID-19 impacts provided above). In the
context of KII issues identified, the scope of gender considerations in the context of in-school programming may have been
further strengthened by a focus on gendered protection issues on the commute of students to and from school, rather than
solely on the infrastructural gender sensitivity of the institutions themselves.
While some answers across modalities suggested agreement with the question of differential impacts on boys and girls, no such
difference was identified by any respondent providing such an answer. As a result, no beneficiary identified any difference in the
impacts which programming in the Gaza Strip had on boys and girls, with many positively reporting that both sexes were able
to enjoy all the benefits of programming equally across all modalities. This does not itself provide evidence that the number of
male and female beneficiaries across all programmes was even, as this dimension of impact was not assessed through
beneficiary surveys.

In the West Bank, differential effects of the programming on male vs female beneficiaries included the kind of work supported
through DEAL life skills (since men typically undertake different kinds of jobs to women), whereas others suggested that remote
learning support was of more relevance for boys since they faced greater difficulties with in-person learning. Other respondents
reported a gendered difference in outcomes owing to gender disparities in the beneficiary cohort composition of certain
modalities (for instance, some ex-detainees were unaware that any female ex-detainees had received support through the
intervention). Beneficiaries of WASH infrastructural rehabilitation in schools similarly thought that these improvements were of
more consequence for female students than males. Learning-based interventions were thought to have different gender impacts
largely as a result of respondents’ views of the receptiveness of boys and girls to learning (which varied in direction of hierarchy
between responses). Insofar as some of the respondents failed to provide a clear justification for their views of different gender
| 49 |
effects, the values in the chart above should be understood as providing a sense of relative difference in gendered outcomes,
rather than absolute levels.

A range of risks affecting girls in their communities were identified by West Bank respondents as potentially alleviated through
participation in constituent programme modalities. These were universally more likely to be reported by female rather than male
respondents, indicating that boys’ sensitivity to girls’ issues could be further improved. Many girls mentioned concerns that
school games and similar play-based learning were more difficult for girls to play than for boys, although no clear evidence of
the foundation for this concern was provided. On the positive effects of the MYRP-supported activities on girls, it was noted that
gender-segregated WASH facilities provided a greater sense of security for girls while at school, while – from a remote
perspective – education on internet safety helped them to stay protected while online. While other challenges affecting girls in
the community were reported, including harassment and other confrontations with armed individuals at military checkpoints and
verbal abuse, respondents did not clarify how the MYRP’s interventions interacted with these challenges either positively or
negatively.
C. To what extent has the programme addressed the needs of the most marginalised people?
Building on the previous sections’ discussion, it does appear that much support was targeted at the most marginalised,
especially children in Area C and young people in detention. Given the scale of needs across much of SoP, the needs of
marginalised children informed the design of programming. However, once again, due to lack of documentary evidence, and a
clear trail of needs assessments, the degree to which the most marginalised were served remains a challenge to concretely
establish.

Chapter 5: Conclusions
5.1 Conclusions
Summary conclusions, linking to each of the key evaluation questions, have been provided below:
 EQ1: How relevant, appropriate, and significant is the SoP ECW/MYRP at the country level? How can these aspects
be strengthened in any future MYRPs in SoP?
A review of the approach taken to respond to, and reduce differentiated inequalities and needs (including those
resulting from age, gender, geographic, disability and/or socio-economic factors), suggests that MYRP design and
implementation intended to impact vulnerable groups by focusing on schools located in areas most impacted by
protracted crises, where children face barriers to access and continuity of education and communities are
experiencing the highest levels of poverty, limited access to services and resources, and are isolated in a manner that
increases their vulnerabilities and marginalisation, while reinforcing certain tradition norms, behaviour and practices
detrimental to specific groups or individuals.. Further efforts to pivot programming to emergent COVID-19 needs also
further promoted a view of intended responsiveness to the needs of children in target zones. The reprogramming of
MYRP highlights the programme’s flexibility and adaptiveness. Allocation of ‘flexible funds’ also highlights the
responsiveness of MYRP in SoP. However, the lack of strong MEAL and outcome monitoring/documentation, and
dependence on self-reporting of implementing partners, makes it challenging to establish the degree to which
programming directly responded to the priority needs of children in SoP. This stems from disjointed design affecting
the establishment of a harmonised MEAL framework, potentially compounded by ECW reporting requirements, i.e.
‘reach’ figures. A related issue is the disjointedness and fragmentation of interventions due to siloed projectisation
within the wider MYRP design.
EQ2: To what extent is the SoP ECW/MYRP aligning with, complementing, and leveraging international and national

humanitarian-development system(s) and related plans, policies, and frameworks? How can these aspects be
strengthened in future SoP MYRPs?
The SoP MYRP was aligned and integrated with other systems and related plans, including in the national education
system and related governmental plans (Education Sector Strategic Plan, Joint Advocacy and Protection Strategy,
the UNRWA Mid-Term Strategy, the Humanitarian Response Plan, and the National Inter-sectoral Violence against
Children Strategy in the Context of Covid-19 2021-2023); however, this may have been (in the case of this specific
MYRP) to the detriment of differentiable impact arising from ECW’s seed funding, and certainly to the detriment of
EiE- and nexus-focussed outcomes and impacts. The core constituency of vulnerable and marginalised children, who
are the main targets as per ECW’s strategic priorities and articulated in the MYRP as Bedouins, Herders etc., were
not demonstrably served by its programming. Likewise, there is an apparent lack of alignment with the wider
Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP). To be concrete, given that the MYRP did not appear to have its own coherent
theory of change, that it was used to fund subcomponents of other siloed education programmes and activities, rather
than a cohesive, holistic set of its own interventions, and that there was limited coordination between the implementing
partners, clear impacts and effects arising from highly atomised ECW-funded activities were difficult to identify.
 EQ3: How does the SoP ECW/MYRP align with, complement, and leverage ECW Global strategic plan, core functions
and other investment modalities (FER)? How can this be strengthened?
There was a nominal alignment to ECW’s global strategic plan and objectives described in the planning phase and
initial application, namely to support in the education of 8 million children across the whole of ECW’s portfolio, and to
increase political support to education in crises; increase financing for education in crises; Improve joint planning and
responses; strengthen capacity to respond; and improve accountability. However, given the high degree of
integration/fragmentation across modality types, partners, and regions, it is challenging to establish the degree to
which ECW actually contributed to the achievement of these objectives. Strengthening this alignment, and desired
impacts, have been addressed in the relevant section below.
 EQ4: To what extent is the SoP ECW/MYRP managed in an efficient, timely and transparent manner? How can these
aspects be strengthened in any future MYRPs?
The efficiency of the MYRP, given the high degree of integration in other programmes implemented by the partners,
can be seen as a strength of the programme, in spite of the typical bureaucratic and other hurdles faced in the course
of implementation. Primary delays in implementation arise in early phases of the project, and as a result of the COVID
crisis; however, partners managed to achieve required outputs before the end of the programme.
| 51 |
 EQ5: To what extent and how has the SoP ECW/MYRP created political commitment to address the needs of children
and youth (boys/girls) affected by conflict and crisis on a global and in-country level?
The MYRP has garnered significant political commitment from domestic leadership in SoP. This is most clearly
expressed in the MoE’s leading role in the MYRP’s governance structure, where the Minister of Education is co-chair
of the Steering Committee (SC) and a senior MoE official from the MoE’s ECW Core team is the co-chair of the
Technical Committee (TC) (ECW narrative report for period 01/2020 – 12/2020, 2021). Since December 2019, the
MoE has taken a series of steps to affirm and consolidate its role in ECW/MYRP governance. These include creating
a team of six officials to liaise with the MYRP’s PMU on management issues, and fostering communication between
MoE officials and the SC and TC by bringing six and 11 officials to them respectively (Ibid.). During 2021, the technical
meetings including the Y3 reprogramming exercise had MoE officials at the core of discussions. The MoE’s Deputy
Minister led the exercise with the PMU and all five MYRP partners involved (Ibid.). UNICEF SoP’s most recent narrative
report to ECW states that this political commitment has helped ensure ‘solid technical discussions and better
information flow within the Ministry and with the ECW partners’ (Ibid., p. 14). Furthermore, MoE has played a proactive
leadership role, appointing a dedicated focal person, reorganising the governance structure, and providing an office
space to PMU for effective coordination and decision making, such as identification of priority needs for allocation of
‘Flexible Funds’.
 EQ6: To what extent and how has the SoP ECW/MYRP contributed directly &/or indirectly to mobilizing and leveraging
funds at country level? How can the MYRPs be strengthened in this regard?
It does not appear that additional international or national resources were mobilised in support of the broader MYRP,
nor does it appear that seed funds contributed toward generation of additional funds earmqarked for MYRP
implementation. In fact, the opposite appears to be the case in SoP: seed funds largely contributed toward other
programmes, priorities, and activities defined by the implementing partners operating in their siloes. This challenge
has been described at length in other sections of the report; it does appear that this inversion of mobilisation (i.e., that
seed funds were mobilised to other strategies and priorities, rather than vice versa) resulted in the dilution of
perceivable or discernible impact arising from ECW's support. Including strategic stakeholders (such as donors, multi-
lateral agencies, and other resource arrangements such as JFA and the GPE) in the Steering Committee to monitor
‘resource mobilisation’ as one of the KPIs of MYRP requires significant restructuring of governance arrangements.
The current governance arrangement face potential conflicts of interest, and are overly narrow in scope and remit.
EQ7: To what extent and how did the SoP ECW/MYRP promote and strengthen a joint, (humanitarian-development)

coordinated, evidence-based, and inclusive approach to EiEPC programming in the State of Palestine? How can
these aspects be strengthened in MYRP?
The MYRP appears to have contributed to the strengthening of existing relationships between various partners and
stakeholders across SoP through the implementation of joint programming, though there were challenges in the
collection and analysis of evidence and data, and related response. Establishment of key units (like the PMU), and
strengthening of existing coordination entities were also highlighted as key, positive outcomes arising from this seed
fund. Since new strategies are due to be developed in the following months, the PMU could serve a coordinating role
to ensure alignment of plans/programmes, including the new ESSP and MYRP, and resources from donors such as
ECW, GPE, JFA, the WB, USAID etc.
EQ8: To what extent and how did the SoP ECW/MYRP strengthen country and local capacities at individual,

organizational and institutional levels for improved EiEPC programming? How can the MYRPs be strengthened in this
regard?
There were a variety of trainings provided to local authorities, which many cited as contributing directly to improved
capacities at the national and local level; furthermore, many of the downstream partners for MYRP implementation
were national and local in nature. However, once again, due to the high level of fragmentation of support, limited
documentary evidence on outcomes and impact, and turnover of local authorities, it is a substantial challenge to point
directly to the MYRP’s impact on capacity, both across national and international partners. Furthermore, it is not
possible to establish whether training leads to capacity building and learning outcomes without a structured, evidence-
and measurement-based approach, such as pre- and post-training assessment and/or training impact assessment.
Additionally, capacity improvement and systems strengthening did not form part of Results Framework (RF) as
intermediate outcomes/results contributing to the overall outcomes/results. As such, there is a lack of evidence to
measure and attribute the impact of training/capacity building/system strengthening inputs.
EQ9: To what extent and how did the SoP ECW/MYRP promote and strengthen: (i) the availability of quality data on

education needs/gaps in SoP, and (ii) the measurement of output and outcome results? How can the MYRPs be
strengthened in this regard?
| 52 |
This was one of the primary deficiencies of the programme highlighted both by investigation and by key informants.
Limited evidence and data was generated, and no evidence on outcomes provided; all evidence generated was on
an output basis, and this appeared to be inconsistent and unstructured, with most of it provided in laconic narrative
reports and none of it independently verifiable. Lack of a unified MEAL Framework and Plan is an important gap, which
originates from the fragmentation and projectisation of MYRP.
EQ10: What is the progress made towards the different collective beneficiary results as identified in the country result

frameworks (access, continuity, equity and gender equality, quality and learning, safety)? How can the MYRP be
strengthened in this regard?
Once again, results beyond outputs were a substantial challenge to establish, given (once again) the high degree of
fragmentation of support, as well as the limited documentary evidence on outcomes collected in the course of the
programme.
 EQ11: How is the SoP ECW/MYRP promoting and strengthening sustainable and resilient education systems and
solutions so far? How can it be strengthened in this regard?
It has been very difficult to determine the specific impact of the programme, not least in terms of its impact on resilience
to crisis or conflict (which is already a very subtle, and difficult to define area). Integration in other larger responses
and actions by the high quantity of implementing partners, and resulting difficulty in discerning unique or differentiable
impact, have much to do with this. Similarly, the way in which the programme and its linked activities were intended
to improve conflict resilience do not appear to have been well defined from the outset, making it even harder to
comment concretely on this research question. Nuanced conflict analysis, vulnerability analysis, and factoring in
resilience within the MYRP design and establishing indicator/s for measuring resilience could be considered for next
generation of MYRP.
 EQ12: To what extent have cross-cutting themes such as gender, age, disability, vulnerability, child and
human rights, and accountability been integrated in the programme?
Crosscutting themes (including all of those mentioned) do appear to have broadly informed implementation of the
MYRP, with nearly all stakeholders praising this aspect of programming; however, the degree to which this was
intentional (rather than an incidental) effect of integration in other, established programmes led by experienced
international partners remained unclear, especially in light of the high degree of fragmentation mentioned in the
findings section of this document. Feedback from stakeholders suggests that programme design was undermined by
a lack of the use of specific tools or programming frameworks (e.g. GEDSI, etc.).
5.2 Additional, General Lessons Learned
Barriers to participation in education lie beyond the school gates
Owing to the highly securitised situation across much of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, the safety of children in
moving to and from school presents – for many – a much larger barrier to the accessibility of education than the
quality of support available while at the school. This is perceived by high-level in-country stakeholders as a much
more contextually relevant barrier to education than concerns over gender discrimination, since gendered inequity
in education is believed to supervene on these physical access challenges (namely, that young men are better
equipped than young women to make such journeys). Within future programming, partners may consider a long-
term approach to remote learning as a viable alternative to costly and likely fluctuating difficulties in physical access.
In addition to using a classic ‘barrier analysis’ framework, context specific dimensions such as conflict, systemic,
cultural, functional, economic, and political analysis should be used with an aim to build resilience across the
programme.
Material needs within high-need schools are themselves varied
MYRP programming typically focuses interventions to target the needs of the most vulnerable and marginalised,
while COVID responses, including those under ‘pivoted’ reprogrammed activities under the ECW/MYRP were
typically more blanket and ‘whole school’ in nature. As identified by a number of students and teachers in schools
which were provided with COVID-19 protective supplies and/or stationery, not all of the children within the high-
need schools are themselves within the highest need category of children in the country. This suggests that the
efficiency of programme expenditure may be improved by adopting a pupil-level assessment of need where possible,
rather than inferring a uniform needs profile for students at a common institution. As an example, a term of support
in stationery may improve the equality of educational opportunities if given as the second term of support for a child
| 53 |
with very high need as compared with its provision as the first and only term of material support for a child with less
severe material needs.
Behavioural change depends on a wide nexus of facilitating conditions
As illustrated during discussions with NGO1 staff regarding the effective reintegration of ex-detainees into their
community, there is a requirement that behavioural and attitudinal shifts be supported across a wide range of
stakeholders, including parents and community members. As counterfactual evidence, reports on the gender-
transformative impacts of programming within certain schools illustrated that some were already predisposed
towards an improvement of attitudes in this regard, whereas others (particularly in more rural situations) were not
so inclined. The evidence in both cases suggests that a more holistic theory of change is required to achieved
behavioural outcomes from the MYRP. Behavioural change interventions would likely be rendered more effective
by ensuring they are designed in light of a comprehensive Knowledge, Attitudes, Practices and Behaviour (KAPB)
assessment, and then monitored and evaluated on the basis of robust data.
There are opportunities to ‘cut out the middle man’ in the context of localised intervention management going via
consortium administrations
The localisation agenda has room to be further streamlined into the organisational set-up of MYRP management,
especially as concerns the opportunity for local NGOs or CSOs to act in a consortium-member capacity directly. It
is anticipated that this would additionally allow for reduced overheads in terms of administrative costs while
additionally building local capacities. This could potentially be addressed through a different programme delivery
modality such as a ‘consortium model’ involving international and local CSOs through a structured capacity and
systems building approach as a win-win proposition.
MEAL and accountability systems need to be strong, well-designed, and implemented from the outset
The lack of strong MEAL data and systems, especially those focussing on monitoring outcome achievement and
collecting systematic, verifiable data on outputs, can be seen as a primary weakness of the programme, which
undermined the effectiveness and accountability of the programme. Ensuring these are designed and planned from
the outset will be important to ensuring these cornerstones of effective programming are in place and used to inform
strong interventions.
More targeted interventions, serving fewer children, with clearer differentiation of focus and fewer partners or (where
feasible) a more streamlined partnership approach built on VfM and localisation of aid commitments
The programme was fragmented, serving large numbers of child and adult beneficiaries with very small quantities of
support; this more diluted approach to serving target population needs made it very challenging to understand,
measure, and manage the programme and its achievement of desired outcomes.
Assumption that training equals improved capacity
In many cases, there appeared to be an assumption that training and ‘capacity building’ provided to national
stakeholders equated to capacity improvements and desired impact. However, inputs (however well intentioned)
do not always equate to impacts; careful consideration, evaluation, and evidence-driven reflection on the
appropriateness and impact of capacity building initiatives will be helpful.
MHPSS for children and teachers
MHPSS programming, especially that focused on COVID response and for children in detention, were highlighted
as some of the most-appreciated elements of programming. Expanding these interventions, and ensuring the
psychosocial needs of teachers are considered, is also strongly recommended.
Lessons from MYRP development and delivery in other contexts
Findings from a comparative analysis between the composition of the SoP MYRP and other MYRPs recently
implemented elsewhere in Africa and the Middle East suggest that, for a given intervention and budget, the planning
and implementation of the SoP MYRP demonstrates a higher overall beneficiary count, and lower expenditure per
beneficiary than elsewhere (Venalainen, Anderson, & Elte, 2021) The result is that more children are supported with
less funding per-capita than in other comparative programming. This bears on the relevance of the intervention
insofar as the Palestinian approach implies a similar profile of high needs amongst a larger group, rather than
disadvantage being distributed much more unevenly as suggested by the greater expenditure/fewer beneficiaries
approach adopted elsewhere. It remains as a point of developmental research the degree to which each approach
to MYRP development is more of less relevant as far as the needs of the country’s children are concerned. Potential
implications of this were addressed in feedback by a range of stakeholders, suggesting this is a wider question
| 54 |
relating to MYRP development globally. This raises a question over the extent to which future programming under
future MYRPs in SoP should seek to adopt a more ‘focused’ approach, though a lack of monitoring and evaluation
data informed by the baseline for the MYRP raises challenges over the extent to which this can be stated definitively.
Nonetheless, similar concerns were echoed in senior stakeholder KIIs. This reiterates the importance of future MYRP
interventions being informed by a solid data set, with robust and comparable monitoring and evaluation in place
before programming is planned, and before implementation begins.
| 55 |
Chapter 6: Recommendations8
The MYRP faced similar challenges across the ECW portfolio; their recent shift has resulted from their learnings in the past
(many of which reflect those from the SoP MYRP): smaller beneficiary scale, offering holistic support to smaller numbers of
children; work on ensuring ECW's 'value-add’ (i.e. in legitimate emergency response vs complement to development-focussed
programming like GPE ESPIGs); minimising the number of partners involved; strengthening MEAL and developing a
standardised MYRP level MEAL plan to ensure that reporting is consistent, up-to-date, and includes metrics of outcome in
learning, access, and equity.
In line with the findings and conclusions of the evaluation, the following are presented as the key recommendations for future
development and implementation of MYRPs within the Palestinian context:

Annexure 3: Methodology
3.1 Research Conceptual Framework and Design
In accordance with the requirement for a rights-based and gender- and vulnerability-sensitive evaluation, the consultants sought
to ensure that issues of gender, realization of child rights, and marginalization are appropriately considered throughout data
collection. This included ensuring that only female data collectors engaged with women and girls, that females felt safe and
comfortable during engagements, and that all vulnerable respondents are appropriately represented (through gender-,
economic-, displacement-status-, and location-disaggregated data collection) across all tools. In addition, all participants were
interviewed in locations where they could not be overhead by other persons, so they felt able to discuss issues comfortably.
3.2 Research Methods
Multiple instruments collected data against individual research questions, engaging in a process of ‘triangulation’ of findings
(Denscombe, 2010). The following data collection tools were developed and deployed by the consultancy team: Portfolio Review;
MYRP Beneficiary Survey; MYRP Beneficiary FGD; Teacher Training and Recruitment Survey; Implementing Staff (Teacher)
KIIs; Client and Stakeholder KIIs.
3.3 Data Analysis
Quantitative data was disaggregated and analysed with pivots, generated with the VADER and RAKE packages, using the
Python coding language, and used to produce graphs, tables, charts, and figures, allowing for in-depth statistical analyses of
secondary, project, data, and primary data where applicable.
The qualitative data was analysed using the VADER package, as well as a bottom-up process of inductive reasoning to identify
any incipient patterns, emerging narrative, and key themes. This approach to qualitative data analysis gives the experiences
and perspectives of participants a central position in the study of findings. This is advantageous, as beneficiaries are the ultimate
recipients in humanitarian programmes, meaning that their perspectives and experiences are critical in measuring wellbeing
outcomes, setting targets, and identifying recommendations. The VADER package was also used to generate ‘sentiment
analysis scores’ in the interval [-4,4] used to convey the overall sentiment expressed across respondents on a particular topic.
Sentiment Analysis Scores
At points throughout this report, ‘sentiment analysis scores’ in the interval [-4,4] are used to convey the overall sentiment
expressed across respondents on a particular topic. While these data can be understood straightforwardly according to the
rule ‘higher scores imply more satisfied respondents’, the following excerpt from the metric’s development paper supported
a more detailed understanding of the data thus presented:
‘The VADER sentiment lexicon is sensitive both the polarity and the intensity of sentiments expressed in social
media contexts, and is also generally applicable to sentiment analysis in other domains.
Sentiment ratings from 10 independent human raters (all pre-screened, trained, and quality checked for optimal
inter-rater reliability). Over 9,000 token features were rated on a scale from "[–4] Extremely Negative" to "[4]
Extremely Positive", with allowance for "[0] Neutral (or Neither, N/A)". We kept every lexical feature that had a
non-zero mean rating, and whose standard deviation was less than 2.5 as determined by the aggregate of those
ten independent raters. This left us with just over 7,500 lexical features with validated valence scores that
indicated both the sentiment polarity (positive/negative), and the sentiment intensity on a scale from –4 to +4.
For example, the word "okay" has a positive valence of 0.9, "good" is 1.9, and "great" is 3.1, whereas "horrible"
is –2.5, [and] the frowning emoticon :( is –2.2, [etc.]’
3.4 Limitations and Mitigation Measures
Thuso was mindful of the following potential limitations on this final evaluation:
▪ Stakeholder recall or knowledge: Given the complexity and diversity of the humanitarian response in SoP, it can be the
case that beneficiaries do not recall one specific support they received; this can make it challenging to garner insight
into what programming impacts might have been, or extract relevant and targeted insights for the evaluation. The
consultancy team worked closely with the client to mitigate this challenge in the field, without causing undue influence
or bias in the data collection process.
| 76 |
▪ Self-reported data: The primary data relies (to a certain extent) on retrospective self-reported data. It is possible that
participants did not recall events completely accurately and/or may have felt pressured to give responses that they
deemed to be socially or (in the case of staff) professionally desirable. The enumeration team was instructed not to lead
the respondents and have been asked to read scripts carefully and explain when appropriate. Analysis also undertook
to account for any biases that may have emerged from such self-reporting.
▪ Client staff time and availability: In-country evaluation activity was one of myriad competing requirements for country
offices; multiple assessments, evaluations, and strategic activities all compete for time of in-country teams, requiring
careful scheduling and limiting the support they can offer. The consultants worked closely with the client to secure
required data, striking a careful balance of tenacity, persistence, and patience to achieve the required outcomes of this
assignment.
In the course of data collection and analysis, the following, additional, issues have the potential to serve as limitations to findings
derived from the data collected:
▪ Lack of Quantitative Data on Intended Impacts and Outcomes: Such evaluations generally make use of a mixed
methods approach, as intended for this report, drawing on primary data, and project data, to allow for both qualitative
and quantitative judgements. In several instances, data on impact and outcomes (i.e. learning outcomes, etc.) has not
been shared with the research team. As such, there is an increased reliance on primary data undertaken in the course
of this evaluation. A range of data analysis techniques, including sentiment analysis scoring, and the use of word-
clouds, have been applied to allow for quantitative analysis despite this limitation.
▪ Potential Skewed Sampling: Reports from enumerators suggest that, while random sampling was sought (within the
constraints detailed in the approved research methodology), interventions (independent of the research team) by
implementation partners and school leaders / teaching staff, may have encouraged participation in data collection by
individuals (particularly teaching professionals) who had participated directly in relevant interventions. This could lead
to an overstating of impact, and an overreporting of awareness, of interventions by such parties.
▪ Exhaustive Sampling in Smaller Settings: Some of the education settings in which data was collected, sample targets
exceeded the number of individuals within the demographic group targeted. In such contexts, sampling was exhaustive,
but fell short of school-level numerical targets as all relevant individuals were engaged.
▪ Potential for Briefing of Respondents: An important component of research is that individual responses should not be
‘led’. Reports from enumerators suggest that, in some instances, Implementation Partners, or the authorities
responsible for management of schools to be visited, requested that research visits be paused, and sought visits to the
schools in question. It is possible that in such cases, interventions may have discussed with respondents by these
parties, which has the potential to undermine the independence and findings.
3.5 Integration of HRBA, Gender Equality, Equity into Evaluation Design and Methods
UNICEF SoP Guidance on Gender Integration in Evaluations was used to guide this research project. This resource explains
that gender should be integrated across all evaluation phases, from planning to implementation, reporting, and
use/dissemination. Thus, the following measures were adopted:
1. Context analysis and reconstructed Theory of Change to ensure strong gender analysis.
2. Where relevant, gender-specific questions have been integrated into the evaluation questions.
3. The data collection plan considers how, by whom, when and where the data collection could limit the participation of
certain gender groups.
4. All enumerators were briefed on UNEG Handbook on Integrating Human Rights and Gender Equality in Evaluation.
5. Data collection teams included female enumerators, and care was taken to ensure that only female data collectors
engage with women and girls, that females feel safe and comfortable during engagements, and that women are
appropriately represented (through gender-segregated data collection engagements) in all data collection. In addition,
where possible, females were interviewed in location where they cannot be overhead by other persons and so they feel
able to discuss issues comfortably.
6. Data was disaggregated along lines of sex, gender identity, age, education, geographical location, poverty, ethnicity,
indigeneity, and disability, as appropriate.
7. Throughout the entire evaluation exercise, data analysis occurred, and Thuso uses an ‘iterative’ process of data analysis,
particularly gender analysis, to show, for example, where data is missing, what the most interesting questions are, or
what further data might be needed that better reflects the gender equality perspective. Data was analysed in a manner
sensitive to gender, with data disaggregated by gender as appropriate. A gender-mainstreaming approach was taken
to report writing
| 77 |
8. There is a plan in place for evaluation findings to be reviewed and validated by the evaluation manager and programme
staff, as well as local stakeholders familiar with social and cultural gender norms.
9. The evaluation report sought to include implications for gender equality and child rights in every section of the evaluation
report
10. Recommendations sought to include specific reference to advancing gender equality and the rights of women and girls,
including Social Protection (SP) and SDGs
11. Any unexpected results on gender equality or rights of women and girls were addressed, as well as other unexpected
gender-based differences in results or processes.
12. UNICEF SoP will ensure that the evaluation dissemination and evaluation products are accessible and barrier free for
all stakeholders, girls and boys, women and men, and their organizations.

Annexure 5: Guidelines for Key Informant Interviews
The study was conducted in line with UNICEF’s guidelines on ethical research,9 and guidelines for conducting research in
conflict situations,10 to ensure that children are involved respectfully and any potential risks of harm are prevented. The
consultancy team followed the United Nations Evaluation Group’s Norms and Standards for Evaluation11 throughout the conduct
of this evaluation, and adhered to the five key evaluator obligations namely independence, impartiality, credibility, declaration of
conflicts of interest, and accountability. The research upheld the following ethical safeguards for research studies: respect for
dignity and diversity, right to self-determination (informed consent), fair representation, compliance with codes for vulnerable
groups (in this case UNICEF Procedures for Ethical Research Involving Children), confidentiality, and avoidance of harm.
Informed consent
Written informed consent for children’s participation in the study was obtained from each child’s parent using a standardised
written consent form in Arabic. The purpose of the research was explained to parents and children by UNICEF staff before the
site visits and when the researcher was on site, allowing opportunity for parents and children to ask questions and consider
whether to participate. This consent was renegotiable meaning that children could withdraw at any stage during an interview.
Written informed consent was also obtained from adult participants. This written informed consent included requesting
permission to quote the participant using his/her position. Consent forms were included at the beginning of each data collection
instrument.
Compliance with UNICEF procedures for ethical research involving children
The study adhered to the UNICEF’s guidelines on ethical research involving children. In addition, an ethical review was
undertaken by Health Media Lab (HML) Institutional Review Board at Headquarters.

Confidentiality (protection of human subject identities and protection of data)
Protection of human subject identities
The names of children and adult participants were not collected. No photographs were taken of children who participated in the
evaluation. Written consent was obtained from participants to include their position/organisation but not their name in cases
where their responses are quoted in the final report.
Protection of data12
KIIs were implemented by the field team using tablets and smart phones. Collected data was submitted to Thuso’s cloud-based
system on a daily basis. All data was collected, uploaded, and stored in a secure format. Extensive measures were taken to
ensure data do not fall into the wrong hands, or lead to adverse effects for respondents or the client.
Avoidance of harm (protection of human subject safety)
The political context of SoP is unpredictable with the potential for escalations of hostilities between local, and regional, armed
groups a daily reality. The situation was monitored on an ongoing basis by Thuso and by UNICEF to ensure action would be
taken to ensure the safety of participants and the research team where emergent concerns would arise.
Potential participants were informed of the study primarily by UNICEF, and by SoP ECW/MYRP PMU, MoE and grantees/partners
where applicable, who facilitated access to respondents in the country and provided introductions to stakeholders.
In the event that participation in the research appeared to have caused upset for individual children, or adverse reactions from
other participants, enumerators were instructed to stop the interview and assess the participant’s mental status by asking them
what their thoughts and feelings are, and whether they feel safe and able to continue the interview. If the participant was unable
to continue, the enumerator would discontinue the interview and escort the participant to a quiet area. The enumerator would
offer, with participant consent, for a member of the UNICEF team to assist them. Where such incidents arose, enumerators
were instructed to document them (anonymously). No such incidents arose during the data collection process.
Annexure 6: Guidelines for Focus Group Discussions
The study was conducted in line with UNICEF’s guidelines on ethical research,13 and guidelines for conducting research in
conflict situations,14 to ensure that children are involved respectfully and any potential risks of harm are prevented. The
consultancy team followed the United Nations Evaluation Group’s Norms and Standards for Evaluation15 throughout the conduct

undertaken by Health Media Lab (HML) Institutional Review Board at Headquarters.
Confidentiality (protection of human subject identities and protection of data)
Protection of human subject identities
The names of children and adult participants were not collected. During the FGD each participant was assigned a number
(including age and sex), which was used to record their responses in the session. No photographs were taken of children who
participated in the evaluation. Written consent was obtained from participants to include their position/organisation but not their
name in cases where their responses are quoted in the final report.
Protection of data16
FGDs were implemented by the field team using tablets and smart phones. Collected data was submitted to Thuso’s cloud-
based system on a daily basis. All data was collected, uploaded, and stored in a secure format. Extensive measures were taken
to ensure data do not fall into the wrong hands, or lead to adverse effects for respondents or the client.
Avoidance of harm (protection of human subject safety)
The political context of SoP is unpredictable with the potential for escalations of hostilities between local, and regional, armed
groups a daily reality. The situation was monitored on an ongoing basis by Thuso and by UNICEF to ensure action would be

Potential participants were informed of the study primarily by UNICEF, and by SoP ECW/MYRP PMU, MoE and grantees/partners
where applicable, who facilitated access to respondents in the country and provided introductions to stakeholders.
FGDs with children were separated by sex. This ensured that cultural sensitivities are respected and the safety, especially of
female participants, was upheld.
In the event that participation in the research appeared to have caused upset for individual children, or adverse reactions from
other participants, enumerators were instructed to stop the interview and assess the participant’s mental status by asking them
what their thoughts and feelings are, and whether they feel safe and able to continue the interview. If the participant was unable

Sample Updated in response to UNICEF SoP Requests and Field Context
In line with the approach set out and approved within the Final Inception Report, final sampling was completed in light of the lists of beneficiary schools shared by
stakeholders. It was originally proposed to sample across West Bank and Gaza for each modality, feedback from stakeholders rendered this unnecessary in modalities
where programming took place in only one of these locations. As such, final samples were amended to reflect this. Overarching sample targets were not amended,
and align with those in the proposed approach, as approved by stakeholders. It should be noted that samples have been listed as ‘NA’ if a specific modality did not
take place in a given location (i.e. for modalities limited to the West Bank or Gaza only, NA would mark a location in which the modality was not implemented, and
where sampling has therefore not taken place).

Towards the end of the data collection, UNICEF SoP requested that data collection be added on 3 additional modalities (arising from ‘pivots’ in programming) to be
added (Computer Labs, STEM and HR systems). The data collection and sample was distributed across the randomly selected beneficiaries in West Bank and within
the MoE, in line with the approach undertaken previously, sampling on the basis of resources available, which were repurposed accordingly.

Annexure 12: Additional Findings
Strategized Approaches for Achieving a Wider Evidence Base:
Engaging MoE all five MYRP partners in all phases of the ECW/MYRP M&E, governance, assessments, re-
programming, and implementation.
Undertaking a participatory external final evaluation led by the joint evaluation committee to create a platform for
cooperation on generating data.
Allowing the PMU to coordinate SoP ECW/MYRP data management with all five MYRP partners.
Creating a Task Force to monitor the implementation of the DEAL intervention.
Supporting NGOs to document violations against the right to education.
Use the National level guide on Inclusive Education developed by UNSECO and relevant experts and endorsed by
the MoE to create and curate an accredited body of institutionalized research.
Leverage UNRWA’s expertise in supporting refugee students, utilizing their robust M&E system for regular reporting
to internal and external stakeholders at all levels.

Process of documentation of violations in and around schools
Through the recruitment of five field data collectors, one of the programme’s local partners was able to ensure the correct
documentation of violations in and around schools (ECW narrative report for period 01/2021 – 12/2021, 2022). A summary of
these processes, as reported in the narrative report, is listed below:
i. The local partner field workers have monitored and documented 236 cases of violations against students and school
faculty in various locations since December 201974.
ii. This intervention ensures proper data is available to enable efficient and rapid response to violations against the right
to education.
iii. All collected data undergoes a rigorous fact-checking and verification process before the information is uploaded to the
Education Cluster’s education-related violations database. Members of the Education Cluster have responded to four
identified incidents, so far, following a cluster trigger response.
iv. SCI has supported the MoE to renew the QLIK license with the company that created the MOE’s own database for
recording education violations, Ulitmit.
v. The QLIK license ensures access to the MoE’s database and allows MoE staff to document violations against schools
and access data to gather information for reporting and prioritize necessary interventions.
Capturing ECW/MYRP Direct Contributions
To capture ECW/MYRP direct contributions, the PMU followed up with MYRP partners on measuring the results of several major
interventions related to improved and safe access to education, including on:
▪ ECW/MYRP physical support to schools;
▪ ECW/MYRP psychosocial supported children;
▪ ECW/MYRP remedial education supported children;
▪ Engaged parents/caregivers (of children under house arrest and ex-detainees); and
▪ Special support to prolonged hospitalized children.

Annexure 13: Gender Considerations of Programming
Further to the primary data garnered above, which provides a range of insights into gender considerations of programming, the
2020 Narrative Report provides a further degree of granularity with regard to the gender sensitive approach adopted, which
informed programming under the auspices of the MYRP:
The programme is ensuring a gender sensitive and responsive approach to programming in both teaching and learning
initiatives, assessments, design and M&E. The Gender Advisor by Save the Children continues to support the PMU and
the entire programme part-time, ensuring gender sensitive programming and implementation and to strengthen the future
programme documents through gender analysis. She also supports the partners by providing refresher capacity building
sessions on gender.
During the COVID-19 crisis, the PMU has emphasized to the partners the importance of maintaining awareness that
across all spheres (education, health, economy, security and social protection etc.) the impact of COVID-19 is
exacerbated for the most vulnerable groups, particularly women and girls, simply by virtue of their sex. According to
recent reporting by UN Women, Palestinian women and girls are disproportionately affected by the pandemic which is
creating and exacerbating pre-existing gender-specific risks and vulnerabilities and is expected to widen inequalities -
especially in the economic sphere. In this context, MYRP partners shall practice due diligence in detecting and providing
immediate support for any increase in incidents of gender-based violence (GBV). All partners have been encouraged to
consider impact of COVID-19 on safeguarding and protection issues in their work and in the risk management matrix
updates.
The ECW/MYRP partners have reported on initiatives on mainstreaming gender. For instance, UNRWA has a five-year
gender strategy which seeks to mainstream gender considerations throughout all its services, including education.
Moreover, UNRWA reflects the gender lens in education policies, strategies, professional development programmes for
educators and in the disaggregated data. The UNRWA education programme emphasises that all Palestine refugee
children, regardless of gender, abilities, disabilities, socio-economic status, health, and psychosocial needs have equal
opportunity for learning in UNRWA schools. In the 2017/2018 academic year, UNRWA also rolled out a Gender Guide
for Teachers, to further enhance understanding of gender issues and activities to address gender biases. The UNRWA
Education in Emergencies (EiE) programme is designed to ensure continued education for boys and girls in times of
acute conflict and to determine and address any gender-based causes. UNRWA schools in [the] Gaza [Strip] and the
West Bank currently educate a total of about 45,726 students in the West Bank (18,345 boys and 27,381 girls) and
282,360 students in [the] Gaza [Strip] (145,867 boys and 136,493 girls) in grades 1-9. Regarding the specific needs of
boys, girls and children with disabilities, activities are designed to cater for these specific needs. ECW/MYRP will also
develop the capacity of education staff and children to address violence in UNRWA schools, considering the different
types of violence affecting boys and girls, as well as children with disabilities. Accordingly, the capacity building of school
staff on addressing violence against children was planned for March-April 2020 in the West Bank but has been postponed
to October 2020, due to the COVID-19 crisis, the related school closures and the vacation period that followed.
Partners working on school maintenance and infrastructure rehabilitation (UNDP & UNRWA) are committed to ensure
gender sensitiveness and inclusive school design for all, including girls and boys with special educational needs and/or
disabilities. In addition, partners are supporting the establishment of gender-appropriate WASH facilities, in addition to
the implementation of new accessibility guidelines developed by the UNRWA Department of Infrastructure and Camp
Improvement: “Technical Standards and Guidelines for Physically Accessible Environment at UNRWA Premises”. The
different needs of these children will be supported through the provision of responsive transport services and assistive
devices to ensure that their individual learning needs are adequately addressed, and they have access to safe and
enabling learning environment.
