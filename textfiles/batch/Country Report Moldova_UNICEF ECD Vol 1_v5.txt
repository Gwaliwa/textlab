Main lessons learned
Lesson learned # 1
Mechanisms that facilitate peer learning and stock-taking activities are essential for
strengthening the CO/ECD staff’s and service provision resilience. They encourage collection
and appliance of the best available knowledge and thinking beyond a “one-time intervention”
approach. Thus, finding time for reflection meetings/debriefings between CO’s staff (and also
ECD staff), although challenging during the emergency, is important to determine what works for
whom in which contexts for achieving more significant impact at scale and
reconfiguring/redesigning programmes, strategies, and services accordingly.
Lesson learned # 2
Needs assessment is an essential step for relevant and efficient learning by ECD stakeholders
and frontline workers and for a flexible ECD response in emergency context and beyond. .
Collecting data to identify training needs helps design training programs and other activities that
cover critical topics, tailored to various groups of participants and integrated into the pandemic
context. The evaluation process and post-training surveys revealed that some needs have
changed or became more evident as the emergency situation evolved. Thus, a recurring
approach to needs assessment is necessary to catch and address such developments.
Lesson learned # 3
Reaching out to and maintaining regular support and contact with disadvantaged families is
essential during global health emergency and beyond. Evidence shows that the impacts of the
crisis caused by the global health emergency were not evenly distributed and affected
vulnerable children and caregivers the most. Ongoing communication with organizations that
have deep knowledge of local context and the needs of such groups is key to developing targeted
and relevant actions. Specific areas to start with, as emphasized by the current crisis, include:
reducing to a minimum the use of parenting practices that are not conducive to young children’s
cognitive and emotional development and preventing violence against children and gender-
based violence in general.
Recommendations
The recommendations have been developed in cooperation with the UNICEF ECARO and Moldova
CO. In line with the evaluation findings in Moldova, the following actions are recommended for
UNICEF:
I. Support national and local efforts towards the sustainable continuous professional
development of frontline workers, including:
• Explore the options to adjust the existing in-service curricula for health workers and educators
to include the most appreciated and needed modules in partnership with medical and
pedagogical universities.
• Advocate for regular training support mechanisms such as peer learning activities, cascade
training, mentoring sessions, and supervision into capacity-building activities.
• Advocate for developing online capacity-building platforms for frontline health workers.
II. Advocate for and support national and local efforts towards digital skills development,

distant learning, and remote service provision in ECD, including:
• Advocate for provisions, including legislation and funding arrangements, ensuring that
kindergartens and health care facilitie s have access to ICT equipment.
• Support the development of training programs designed to fortify frontline workers' digital skills
and inclusion of these trainings into regular capacity-building activities.
• Support development of disability-sensitive training content for frontline workers on providing
online support to education.
III. Strengthen capacities of LPA representatives and managers from health and education
services to enhance the use of local resources and increase efficiency Continue to support
capacity-building activities that empower caregivers and reflect the needs of vulnerable
families and staff working with them, including:
• Provide technical support and advocate for developing a teacher-training program aimed at
continuous improvement of preschool didactical and support staff's capacity on inclusive early
childhood education.
• Support and advocate for approval of the new cross-sectoral Strategy on Positive parenting
(as this one expires in 2022) along with the Action Plan and support the implementation of the
regular positive parenting training for both preschool workers and caregivers.
• Support information and coaching provision tailored to the frontline workers' needs for
improved communication skills to better respond to caregivers and the most vulnerable
groups’ needs.
• Advocate for the integration of pre- and post-training assessment of participants' knowledge
and skills into capacity-building programs.
IV. Advocate for the integration of preparedness and resilience-building contents into the
professional development of frontline workers, including:
• Advocate for and support the integration of COVID-19 related training content into in-service
curricula and post-graduate courses.
• Advocate for and support the integration of sessions on psychological support, well-being, and
emotional implications of coping with the crisis situation into the capacity-building activities.
• Advocate for integrating disability in the training content on prevention and protection against
infection with COVID-19 and other emergencies.
• Regularly monitor and evaluate the impact of UNICEF-supported interventions in health and
education sectors..
• Translate the crisis preparedness and response guidelines for caregivers into accessible
languages and formats, and consider visual forms of information provision.

MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION
COUNTRY REPORT: MOLDOVA
1 .0. Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic is a multi-dimensional crisis that has profoundly affected the
development and psycho-social well-being of young children and their caregivers. Evidence
from around the world clearly shows that the crisis has exacerbated existing vulnerabilities and
brought new immediate and longer-term challenges to children’s well-being. In addition to the
pandemic’s primary effects, such as increased poverty and income insecurity, families with
young children have faced an unprecedented disruption of essential health, early learning, and
other essential services.
United Nations Children’s Fund’s (UNICEF’s) early childhood development (ECD) teams across the
Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region have played a critical role in supporting governments’
responses to COVID-19. Efforts were recalibrated to address the immediate needs of young
children and their families. This included re-purposing and strengthening available resources
and workforce to provide information and services in the circumstances of home confinement,
reduced availability of ECD services, and an ongoing public health threat.
The pandemic has created a set of novel circumstances which demanded specific actions, such
as introducing new interventions or rapidly adapting the existing ones. Now, evidence is needed
on the appropriateness and efficiency of these new responses and adjustments. The lessons
learned can help develop longer term recovery plans and budgets for ECD services to strengthen
the resilience of ECD systems across ECA.
For this purpose, UNICEF ECA Regional Office (ECARO) commissioned Ecorys to carry out the Multi-
Country Evaluation of the UNICEF ECD response to COVID-19 in the ECA region.
A developmental evaluation approach was adapted to provide rapid evidence and enable real-
time adjustment of ongoing efforts. The evaluation entails an in-depth study in four ECA countries:
Croatia, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine, with a view on the lessons learned from the region as a
whole. The evaluation started in November 2020 and continued until the end of 2021.
This report presents the findings from the evaluation in the Republic of Moldova (hereafter as
Moldova). It covers selected UNICEF-supported ECD response to COVID-19 in Moldova – including
continuing and discontinued interventions – implemented from March 2020 to August 2021. It
sets out the context of the evaluation; a description of the object of the evaluation; its overall
purpose, objectives, and scope; the methodology; key findings; lessons learned and conclusions
and recommendations. It summarizes the evaluation team’s assessment of the relevance,
effectiveness, and sustainability of UNICEF’s ECD response to COVID-19 in Moldova. The findings
and recommendations in this report are intended to primarily serve UNICEF Moldova Country
Office (CO), UNICEF ECARO, and national governmental and non-governmental stakeholders
(duty bearers) in Moldova working with young children and families (right holders). The findings
will also be useful to those UNICEF COs starting their new programme cycles in 2023 to reflect on
the lessons learned that apply to their contexts.
The evaluation team would like to express their gratitude to the staff of UNICEF Moldova CO for
their continuous support. We also thank the government of Moldova, the National Center for Early
Education and Family information (CNETIF), the Public Association for Women and Children
“NOVA”, and all of the frontline workers from a range of institutions who shared their experiences
and views with us. Finally, we thank the staff from the UNICEF ECARO Evaluation and ECD teams
for their invaluable inputs, guidance, and management of the evaluation.

2 .0. Context and purpose of the evaluation
2.1. Evaluation background
This section provides an overview of UNICEF’s ECD country priorities and the scope of the country
program. It then looks at the impact of COVID-19 on the ECD services and the responses
undertaken by the national and local government and UNICEF to mitigate the challenges that
emerged with or were aggravated by the pandemic outbreak.
2.1.1. Overview of UNICEF’s ECD program in Moldova
The overarching vision for UNICEF’s Country Programme Document in Moldova during the period
2018-2022 is the equitable realization of all child rights, including the rights to education, health,
an adequate standard of living, and participation. The strategy is fully aligned with national
priorities including: National Development Strategy “Moldova 2020”, Child Protection Strategy
2014–2020, Action Plan to support the Roma population 2016–2020, Strategy for Development of
Education for All 2011–2020, and National Strategy on Public Health 2014–2020. It also contributes
to two outcomes and goals of 2018–2022 United Nations Development Assistance Framework
(UNDAF), Sustainable Development Goals, and UNICEF Strategic Plan 2018–2021 in the areas of
governance, human rights, gender equality, inclusive and equitable social development and
education, reduction of inequality and child poverty, healthy life and the well-being of children,
adequate access to child-friendly justice and accountable institutions, and prevention of
violence against children.
Developing inclusive national systems and services that respond to the needs of the most
vulnerable children equitably is a key theme in the 2018-2022 Country Programme of the
Government of Moldova and UNICEF. In order to achieve this, key actions are directed to support
advancements in:
• policy and legislative reforms to align national systems to the Sustainable Development
Goals and the Concluding Observations of the Committee on the Rights of the Child,2
• efficiency and accountability of national systems in building the capacities of professionals,
civil society and adolescents, and
• designing and testing viable models that demonstrate the effectiveness of more
comprehensive social services for children at the community level, focusing on inter-
sectoral cooperation.3
The priorities for early childhood development in Moldova, which cut across the action areas
mentioned above, relate to nurturing care, health, protection and education, and call for
improved intersectoral cooperation in these sectors. More specifically, the 2018-2022 Country
Programme promotes:

• strengthening early childhood development skills among parents, communication between
parents and other caretakers, and development of cross-sectorial policy documents on
positive parenting;
• the well-being of pregnant women and the safe delivery to improve child survival, growth and
development, increased knowledge of child healthcare and improved access to health
services, immunization, good nutrition, and youth-friendly health services;
• modeling of specialized foster care services at the community level and elimination of the
drivers of institutionalization through poverty alleviation programs and support services for
children with disabilities and single mothers;
• reduction of reliance on institutional care and ending violence against children by modeling
of specialized foster care services, poverty alleviation programs, and support services for
children with disabilities and single mothers;
• reduction of vulnerability to economic and social exclusion and monitoring child rights, and
• preschool education enrolment, child-friendly schools, and inclusive education (with a special
focus on vulnerable children and Roma children).
While addressing these issues, special attention is placed on supporting health and social
workers to provide better quality services, including additional services to vulnerable children
and pregnant women. This includes trainings on child and maternal healthcare and
communication with parents/caregivers to improve their capacities to recognize danger signs
in pregnancy and child health, child development milestones, and implement positive parenting.4
The Country Programme has a specific gender focus to ensure adequate care for infants and
young children and girls’ secondary education.
2.1.2. Overview of implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for ECD in
Moldova
2.1.2.1. Disruption of services
Limited access for children and their families, including those identified as vulnerable, to
healthcare, educational and social services was one of the substantial implications of the
COVID-19 pandemic on the early childhood development services in Moldova. The lockdown
forced preschools and early childhood development centers to close down from early March until
August 2020. As a result, many preschool-aged children could not attend their educational
institutions and lost access to high-quality early education. Distant modalities to support learning
were introduced, but the limited access of many children and their families to IT equipment and
the internet emerged as key barriers. According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS),
children’s access to distance learning was constrained by: insufficient number of computers and
other electronic devices (10%), poor internet connection (10%), lack of internet connection (6%),
lack of electronic equipment (4%) in households. 5 These factors were correlated with a
significantly lower level of household wealth among families who reported such challenges. The

NBS’ study revealed that their expenditure on consumption was about 50% lower than in the
g eneral sample.6
The COVID-19 pandemics affected all lev els/components of the healthcare system, including
the need for safety protocols in institutions, protective equipment, hygiene supplies, human
resources, and swift capacity building /training regarding new protocols. Consequently, many
essential healthcare services were suspended or available at reduced capacity due to limited
hospital capacities. Women and children had difficulties receiving services regarding sexual
and reproductive health, detection and clinical management of gender-based violence,
antenatal and post-natal care, neonatal, child and adolescent healthcare, and immunization
and screening services.7 According to NBS, the rate of immunization of 1-year-old children
decreased substantially in 2020 in comparison with 2019.8
The crisis affected not only the capacities of essential healthcare services but also the situation
of frontline workers, who were especially vulnerable to COVID-19 infections. At the beginning of
the outbreak, the Moldavian healthcare system suffered from shortages in personal protective
equipment and some antiviral drugs. International supply chains were disrupted, and the
Government’s procurement processes were not sufficiently prepared to respond to the increased
demand created by such a large-scale public health emergency.9 Therefore, many healthcare
workers were vulnerable to infection and became infected.10 The frontline healthcare also lacked
specific guidance to safely respond to the emergency in healthcare and urgently needed
technical, professional, and psychological support to work in the new challenging conditions.
2.1.2.2. Disruption of family life/routine
The difficulties in ensuring continuity of education were augmented by the need to provide
support to parents to assume the role of educators.11 This was especially the case among
families from vulnerable backgrounds, particularly those living in rural areas and Roma
communities.12 Parents in these households often have limited digital literacy and low levels of
educational attainment. In addition, families with lower education levels are on average 30% less
likely to have internet access. Before the pandemic, only 67% of such households had internet
access. All these factors make children in rural areas and Roma children disproportionately
affected by the transition to online education.
The closure of preschools and social services during the pandemic increased the burden on
women, who often play the role of primary caregivers. The study conducted by UN Women
reported that more than half of the women were dedicating several hours a day to support their
child’s education process, for instance, by helping with homework.13 Moreover, high levels of
domestic violence are also mentioned as a significant issue, especially during the lockdowns. As

compared to March 2020.15 Moreover, data from the Ministry of Education, Culture and Research

particularly in the context of lockdown.17 The most common form of violence is bullying, followed
by physical and psychological violence. Additionally, cyberbullying has emerged as a significant
problem in distance learning.18
The pandemic also negatively affected the employment and wages of families with young
children. As NBS’s research revealed, 17% of the households reported a reduction in or loss of
income from work, 8% - a reduction in or loss of remittances, and 4% - the withholding of salaries,
pensions, social benefits. In addition, every fifth respondent mentioned reducing food expenditure
to deal with the financial hardship.19 Food insecurity has affected children's nutrition, especially
those from the most vulnerable families and increased the risk of malnutrition. Research suggests
that under-nutrition, especially in the first 1000 days of a child’s life, may lead to suboptimal brain
development.20 Before the pandemic, 6% of children in Moldova were suffering from stunted
growth and the diminished availability of food during the pandemic is believed to exacerbate the
situation.21
2.1.3. National (and local) government efforts to address COVID-19
implications for ECD in Moldova
The unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the early childhood development
sector required a massive and quick response from the governments and humanitarian
agencies. The response needed to include measures for ensuring the continuity of the ECD
services, including through introducing innovations, such as online counseling or the provision of
distance learning for preschool children.
Based on International Health Regulations (IHR) from 2005, the Law no. 10 of 3 February 2009 on
state supervision of public health, and WHO recommendations, on March 13, 2020, the National
Committee for Public Health Emergency approved the National Emergency Preparedness and
Response Plan. A few days later, The Parliament of the Republic of Moldova declared a state of
emergency on the country’s entire territory from March 17 to May 15, 2020. The National
Commission for Emergency Situations of the Republic of Moldova (CNESP) was empowered to
manage the situation in the country.22
To ensure children and families’ access to essential healthcare services, infection and
prevention control protocols were developed and implemented in healthcare, educational,
and social care services. National and local public authorities developed and implemented the

measures for continuing the provision of essential healthcare and educational services.23 The
G overnment carried out various communication activities to increase population awareness and
community involvement in the prevention of infection. To this end, the Ministry of Health, Labor
and Social Protection (MHLSP) created an inter-sectorial group of communicators24 and
coordinated communication actions at the national level. The materials developed with the
support of WHO and UNICEF and the media were placed on the public authorities’ websites and
were continuously disseminated by other development partners. Moreover, the MHLSP organized
daily press briefings on the current situation. The National Agency for Public Health established
the Green Line to provide information and psychological assistance for the population. The
Government increased testing capacities, particularly among the most vulnerable groups
(from long-term care institutions, people with disabilities, people over 60 years) and healthcare
workers with symptoms.25
Educational activities of preschools and schools were transferred online. All institutions had to
follow the document “Instructions on preparation for reopening of preschool institutions in the
context of the COVID-19”26 and the framework regulations for the implementation of the
Instruction mentioned earlier 27 Educators and parents were informed about the new
requirements and rules in educational institutions. From September 1, 2020, preschool facilities
have been gradually opened, creating a safe learning and care environment for children, parents,
and staff. Regarding schools, the Government developed seven organizational models of the
educational process during the academic year 2020-2021. Different variations required physical
presence at school and/or distance communication and were applicable in different situations.
28 Starting from September 1, 2020, the educational process was relaunched in all educational
institutions, while parents and students received guidelines that provided advice in the context
of COVID-19.29
2.1.4. Overview of UNICEF-supported adaptations of ECD
interventions in Moldova
In response to the outbreak of COVID-19, the UNICEF’s Country Office (CO) needed to adapt its
ECD program activities in Moldova. The United Nations in Moldova (UNCT) created the Moldova
COVID-19 Response and Recovery Window under the Moldova 2030 Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) Multi-Partner Trust Fund. The theory of change of the Fund Window concentrates
on supporting the Government of Moldova to tackle the health emergency, as well as to address
the social and economic impact of the pandemic. Additionally, the Window intends to reduce the

country’s vulnerability to the pandemic and enable a transparent and effective recovery
p rocess.30 As part of the Response and Recovery Plan, UNICEF plays a pivotal role in supporting
the government to respond to COVID-19 challenges related to ECD and established new
interventions targeted at the COVID-19 crisis.
UNICEF and WHO supported the MHLSP to develop a Government COVID-19 Emergency
Response Plan. This Plan aimed to assess the needs for personal protective equipment (PPE),
tests, and medical equipment, as well as to adapt procurement mechanisms to the emergency
situation and to strengthen the capacities for procurement, especially of vaccines and
pharmaceuticals. 31 In line with these objectives, UNICEF supported frontline workers and
vulnerable communities by providing them with PPE and other necessary supplies. To ensure
additional protection of vulnerable children and families against COVID-19 and to address the
needs of healthcare workers and parents, UNICEF provided WASH and Hygiene supplies to 41 Youth
Friendly Health Centers, 12 maternity hospitals, all schools and preschools. Also UNICEF provided
PPE to 12 residential schools and institutions for children, including for children with disabilities,
and 35 District Psycho-pedagogical Assistance Services.32 Moreover, UNICEF supported the
Institute for Emergency Medicine with oxygen concentrators, surgical masks, FFP2 respirators,
face shields, and gloves.33 In addition, more than 580 frontline healthcare workers from more than
100 primary healthcare units in Ungheni and Cahul districts received 2,000 waterproof gowns and
1,600 disposable non-woven protective suits.34
Material supplies were also distributed directly to families and children, especially the most
vulnerable ones. Examples of UNICEF’s interventions include:
• Provision of PPE supplies to 225 vulnerable families benefitting from early intervention services
for young children with developmental delays and disabilities.35
• Provision of food and hygiene packages to 300 vulnerable families affected by violence and
books and educational materials to 1,000 children. This support helped reduce the burden on
families affected by violence, specifically mothers.36
• Hygiene supplies have been procured and delivered to 21 Roma children in Nicoreni village,
Drochia District, before the start of the school year, to facilitate school attendance by Roma
children.37
• Procurement of laptops and more than 500 educational supplies kits for children from
vulnerable families, including Roma.38
• Hygienic supplies and thermometers to preschool before their re-opening in September 2020.
The swift mobilization of UNICEF to identify funds and procure the needed supplies has been
appreciated by the receiving parties and contributed to bringing into focus the area of WASH,
especially in schools. An increased focus on supplies, not so prominent prior to the pandemic,

was based on UNICEF's comparative advantage at the CO to access funds, asses needs and
e nsure procurement. The supply component was complementary to other system strengthening
interventions (e.g. protocols, capacity-building).
Another set of UNICEF’s support centered around the Risk Communication and Community
Engagement pillar. The primary objective of these actions was to expand awareness about
COVID-19 and basic preventative behaviors. They targeted both the general public and
professionals from sectors such as healthcare, social services, and education. UNICEF and WHO
supported MHLSP in developing a Communication Strategic Plan to support the vaccination
campaign. UNICEF and WHO continue to support the Ministry of Health, Labor and Social
Protection and the National Agency of Public Health with informational activities such as a
publicly distributed video underlining the importance of restricting COVID-19 measures. A
campaign to promote immunization against COVID-19 immunization was also developed by the
joint efforts of WHO, UNICEF and the Ministry of Health, Labor and Social Protection (MoHLSP).39 This
awareness campaign, “Be safe: get COVID-19 vaccine”, included messages on vaccines benefits,
printed materials for targeted audiences, video and audio messages, and a webpage.40 Online
interviews with experts on the possible adverse effects of vaccination supplemented these
actions.41 To address the increase in online violence during the transition to online education,
UNICEF supported an educational webinar with an online-security expert from La Strada, covering
the topics of online bullying.42
Initiatives aimed at expanding awareness about the risks associated with COVID-19 and
capacity building were introduced in frontline sectors such as healthcare, education, and
social services. Online trainings were conducted for obstetricians-gynecologists, neonatologists,
pediatricians, and midwives and specialist workers on obstetric emergency care and referral of
pregnant women, nutrition of pregnant women and nursing mothers, feeding, newborn care in
post-epidemic conditions COVID-19, and antenatal care during the pandemic. 43 Primary
healthcare specialists also learned about outpatient care services, nutrition, and support for
breastfeeding and HIV testing services for pregnant women. In addition, an event featuring the
benefits of breastfeeding, including in the COVID-19 period, was featured during World
Breastfeeding Week.44
Trainings in the educational sector, teaching and nonteaching personnel at pre-primary level,
involved topics such as prevention of infectious diseases in educational institutions, knowledge
regarding COVID-19 regulations, protocols for COVID-19 and infectious diseases prevention and
control.45 UNICEF also introduced national online trainings for preschool teachers on positive
parenting during the COVID-19 pandemic, transition, and recovery period. Another capacity-
building initiative in education included trainings aimed at strengthening digital literacy,
knowledge and skills of teaching staff in the preprimary subsector in support of online learning.46
The aim is to create a critical mass of preschool teachers (representing approximately 80% of the
teaching staff) who can confidently use digital skills to search, collect, receive, store and process

information, thus improving their online educational services during the pandemic, transition,
a nd recovery periods.
In order to improve children’s access to q uality child protection and services, a comprehensive
draft Manual for child protection specialists has been developed and approved by MHLSP. It was
distributed among relevant local authorities, service providers, individual specialists, and
caregivers working with children during the pandemic. 47 The document includes a
comprehensive set of targeted guidelines for key professionals on how better to deliver
assistance and services to families and children and ensure a unified approach to implementing
main cross-sectoral mechanisms and sectoral tools during pandemics.
To increase the sustainability of the emergency actions, UNICEF Moldova provides support to the
MECR to develop the new long-term Education Sector Strategy for 2021-2030 and medium-term
Programme of Action 2021-2025. The new policy documents focus on creating a resilient,
inclusive, friendly, and effective education system and will include a separate component on the
prevention of humanitarian crisis.
2.2. Evaluation purpose, objectives, scope, and
methodology
2.2.1. Evaluation purpose and objectives
This evaluation’s overarching purpose is to provide UNICEF Moldova CO , UNICEF ECA Regional
Office, and national government and partners with a critical assessment of the key adaptations
made in UNICEF ECD program in the ECA region to meet the changing needs of young children
and families. The secondary purpose of this evaluation was twofold: 1) to provide real-time
feedback and generate learnings to inform the further development of the assessed ECD
activities adapted or newly designed to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic; and 2) to provide
evidence to inform future ECD efforts in similar emergencies.
The objectives of the evaluation were to:
• assess the extent to which the ECD activities (interventions) are being implemented in
Moldova, how they are meeting the needs of young children and families, especially when their
needs change as the COVID-19 outbreak evolves, and
• assess the effectiveness of the ECD activities in improved programming and systems
strengthening support to the Moldovan government.
In line with the above, the main evaluation questions were as follows:

Annex 4, Vol. 2 of the Country Report: Moldova presents the sub-questions for this evaluation.48
The evaluation process followed a developmental evaluation approach due to the dynamically
changing context of the assessed interventions. As such, it supported UNICEF Moldova Country
Office (CO) in spotting emerging patterns of their current activities and using them to reframe
their approaches and reset their priorities, goals, and strategies where needed. The evaluation
also entailed some elements of formative evaluation to highlight how well the adapted or new
initiatives are working. Section 2.2.3 below provides an overview of how this approach was
implemented in practice.
The primary intended users of the evaluation are UNICEF Moldova CO, UNICEF ECA Regional Office
and national authorities and partners. The findings can be useful for the CO, which is starting a
new programme cycle in 2022 to reflect on the lessons learned applicable to the wider ECD
strategy. They inform the ECD programming in the near future in relation to the situations such
as that of COVID-19, and similar contexts, to ensure the continuity of ECD-related services
delivered to children and families regardless of the pandemic.
Upon UNICEF’s request, the recommendations are formulated to focus on strategic areas for
UNICEF Moldova to improve its ECD programme based on the evidence emerging from this
evaluation. As such, they go beyond explicitly pandemic-related issues as the findings in this
report confirm that an urgent action to protect and strengthen ECD is necessary to mitigate
immediate and long-term adverse impacts of COVID-19 on young children and their families.49
48 Given the purpose of the evaluation, only three criteria (relevance, effectiveness, sustainability) were included in the ToR.
No cost analysis is included because efficiency analysis was not considered a priority for the context and approach.

2.2.2. Evaluation object and scope
The ECD activities (interventions) assessed were capacity-building activities (trainings) or
information support for frontline workers that are/were:
a. either introduced directly in response to COVID-19 or altered to fit into the COVID-19
restrictions;
b. categorized according to the following specific adaptations: 1) moving an existing service to
a digital mode of engagement or delivery or complementing the existing service with new
modalities of distance support; 2) introducing new services to address new needs for current
service users; 3) adapting existing or incorporating new services or service provision
modalities to meet the needs of new groups of service users;
c. viewed by the UNICEF Moldova Office as especially useful to have feedback for future
programming;
d. implemented from March 2020 when the COVID-19 outbreak started and up to the moment
of their evaluation (completed interventions were evaluated up until their end).
At the same time, activities which do not fall under these criteria, as requested by ToR, and were
not delivered through “a workforce” (frontline workers), were not covered by the evaluation.50
Therefore, the primary data collected refers to the frontline workers' trainings only and other
components of the interventions (where envisaged) have not been assessed (e.g., reference to
the PPE and other necessary supplies was made only if it related to findings on frontline workers
capacity-building activities). The table below provides a summary of all activities that were
covered by this evaluation.
In terms of temporal scope, the evaluation covered interventions implemented from March 2020
when the COVID-19 outbreak started and up to the moment of their evaluation (completed
interventions were evaluated up until their end). The geographic scope covered all of Moldova.
A brief presentation of all interventions assessed can be found in a table below.
50 Excluded interventions: interventions which focus on the provision of COVID-19-related guidelines and recommendations
to government bodies and other actors, provision of learning/health kits to children/mothers, or the provision of training
directly to the caregivers without training or preparing the frontline workers.

2 .2.3. Approach and methodology
In line with the developmental evaluation a pproach, the evaluation focused on a.) collecting and
analyzing real-time data to answer the evaluation questions and b.) supporting the use of the
obtained evidence for ongoing programme adaptation.
For this purpose, three interventions were selected by the Country Office for in-depth analysis
of their relevance, effectiveness, and sustainability during rapid assessment cycles. Each of the
cycles focused on one intervention, selected per the criteria outlined in section 2.2.2. For each
cycle, the evaluators collected and analyzed data on the intervention, provided rapid feedback
to the CO, and facilitated evaluative reflection and programming adaptation. Figure 1 outlines
the key steps taken as part of each rapid assessment cycle. For more detailed information about
the in-depth assessed interventions, please see Country Report Vol. 2, Annex A1.1, A1.2, and A1.3.

For each cycle, the evaluators collected and analyzed data on the intervention, provided rapid
feedback to the CO, and facilitated evaluative reflection and programming adaptation (please
see Sections 2.2.3.1 and 2.2.3.2 on data collection and formulation of solutions).
In addition to the in-depth analysis, two interventions were selected for complementary desk
research-based, “light” assessment, focused mainly on relevance.51 They were reviewed during
the final synthesis phase together with other primary and secondary sources concerning ECD in
Moldova to document all ECD interventions of interest that were adapted to COVID-19. Such an
approach helped to view ECD from a broader perspective and thus provided a wider knowledge-
base for UNICEF’s upcoming programmatic adjustments.
Finally, as mentioned earlier, the evaluation entailed an element of a formative inquiry to help
shape the future of ECD programming in the four countries concerned. This Country Report,
developed in accordance with UNICEF quality standards for evaluations, is the primary
manifestation of this approach.
51 The methodology agreed during the evaluation’s inception phase did not envisage ToCs to be developed for these
interventions. Initially, there were three interventions selected for the “light” assessment, but one did not fulfill the criteria as
per ToR and was not included.

MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION
COUNTRY REPORT: MOLDOVA
2.2.3.1. Data collection and analysis
To collect the data, the evaluators used a mix of qualitative and quantitative techniques. These
included:
▪
desk research: including primary and secondary sources concerning ECD in Moldova,
UNICEF’s programming and COVID-19 related activities in the country, as well as all the
evaluated interventions specifically;
▪ three cycles of rapid data collection and analysis:52
1. The first cycle focused on the COVID-19 response for women and their children in 12
perinatal centers from the Republic of Moldova and included: desk review, an online
survey (hereafter referred to as “the evaluation survey”) completed by 14 survey
respondents (frontline workers) and 7 Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) with selected
stakeholders, frontline workers, and UNICEF Moldova CO (see Country Report Vol. 2, Annex
A1.1).
2. The second cycle focused on strengthening capacities of preschool staff, parents and
LPAs to ensure a state of preparedness and response to COVID-19 and included: desk
review, the evaluation survey completed by 135 survey respondents (frontline workers),
and 7 KIIs with selected stakeholders, frontline workers, and UNICEF Moldova CO (see
Country Report Vol. 2, Annex A1.2).
3. The third cycle covered regional project on Social Inclusion of Roma Children and
Children with Disabilities in Eastern Balkans and Moldova included: desk review, the
evaluation survey completed by 56 survey respondents (frontline workers), and 7 KIIs with
selected stakeholders, frontline workers, and UNICEF Moldova CO (see Country Report Vol.
2, Annex A1.3).
An overview of these interventions is presented in Table 1 above.
Respondents for interviews were selected based on a stakeholder mapping carried out jointly
by the evaluators and the CO staff (please see Country Report Vol. 2, Annex A0: Stakeholder
mapping). For each intervention analyzed in-depth, stakeholders were mapped according to
their degree of influence and impact on the intervention. Stakeholders with the most influence
and impact were selected for individual interviews. Sampling of stakeholders for KIIs also
considered the principle of “good enough” data for the proposes of the developmental
evaluation. Representatives of duty bearers (government, civil society organizations) were also
invited to participate in the evaluation workshops, review analytical briefs, and join the Evaluation
Reference Group (ERG).
All frontline workers to whom e-mail addresses were available received an invitation to
participate in the online surveys.
The qualitative data from interviews and surveys were subject to thematic analysis carried out
using MAXQDA. The evaluation team used coding to develop themes by identifying items of
analytic interest in the data and tagging these with a coding label. The quantitative data
gathered from the surveys was subject to quantitative data analysis. This included studying the
52 Details on KIIs and survey results are included in the Analytical Briefs, Annex AI.

distributions, spreads, and centers of responses. Cross-tabulation was also used to investigate
p otential correlations between variables.
2.2.3.2. Formulation and implement ation of solutions
Based on each rapid assessment cycle, the key findings, conclusions, and preliminary
recommendations were drawn up in the form of Analytical Briefs (see Country Report Vol. 2,
Annexes A1.1, A.1.2, A.1.3). The briefs were reviewed by the RO and the CO and revised based on
their feedback.
After two of the three cycles, a reflection workshop was organized with Moldova CO, the ECARO,
and relevant key stakeholders, including government and implementing partners. The primary
purpose of the workshops was to provide space for evaluative reflection, prioritize and refine the
recommendations, and discuss how they could be best implemented. The secondary purpose
was to build capacity for evaluative thinking, increase understanding and ownership of the
findings, and, accordingly, the likelihood that they will be used.53 After the first workshop, the
evaluators prepared a short note with key takeaways from the meeting (see Country Report Vol.
2 Annex 2). On the basis of recommendations from Analytical Briefs and the workshop
discussions, the Moldova CO prepared a list of key actions to be taken. It is the evaluators’
understanding that these actions were implemented, fulfilling the objectives of the
developmental evaluation.
2.2.3.3. Ethics
The evaluation methodology in Moldova did not foresee data collection with child participants or
representatives of other particularly vulnerable groups. However, it did involve respondents
through the survey and interviews. Consequently, the team followed the highest standards of
ethics, including the UNICEF Procedure for Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation, Data
Collection and Analysis (2021)54, the UNEG Ethical Guidelines for Evaluation (2020)55, and the
research protocol designed for the purpose of this study (see Country Report Vol. 2, Annex 5). The
evaluation team respected the following principles56 throughout its engagement with UNICEF:
Respect for dignity and diversity; Fair representation; Compliance with codes for vulnerable
groups (e.g., ethics of research involving young children or vulnerable groups); Redress;
Confidentiality; and Avoidance of harm. Limitations
2.2.4. Limitations
The key limitations to analysis in Moldova included:
• Focus on collecting “good enough” evidence to provide rapid feedback that makes
adaptations in real-time possible (developmental evaluation approach) outweighed
methodological rigor. Hence, upon agreement with the ECARO, interviews or surveys with the
final beneficiaries - rights holders (i.e., children and their families) - of the interventions were
not included in the methodology not to jeopardize the rapid nature of the data collection and
analysis cycles. In effect, the evaluators had to rely on secondary evidence and the views of

frontline workers to generate findings on the relevance and effectiveness of the interventions
for the final beneficiaries. For a similar reason, reconstruction of detailed ToCs and heavy
reliance on ToCs were not possible and the participation of other duty bearers (government,
CSOs) was relatively limited.
• Limited secondary data was available on two desk-reviewed interventions as layer 2, where
no interviews or surveys were envisaged to complement desk research results. Consequently,
the sections on effectiveness and sustainability are based exclusively on findings from three
cycles of rapid data collection.
• Quantitative information was collected using online surveys, which may have excluded
frontline workers with few digital skills and ICT equipment from participating in the evaluation.
• The evaluators were not involved in the process of change inspired by the evaluation findings
as different interventions were assessed throughout the three rapid data collection cycles
(instead of repeating the assessment of one). Such an approach was as agreed with the
UNICEF ECARO to collect more data and increase the utility of findings for future programming.
Consequently, it was impossible to describe how the interventions under review adapted
based on the generation of real-time evidence and timely decision-making – not assessed.
• In line with the evaluation’s purpose, the analysis of the needs of young children and their
families focused on needs created or compounded by the COVID-19 context. Hence,
interventions were not analyzed from a broader child rights perspective.

3 .0. Main findings
3.1. Relevance
This section explores the relevance of the analyzed UNICEF interventions in Moldova to the needs
of (i) young children and their families and (ii) frontline workers. It considers the interventions’
alignment with both long-standing, critical needs of these groups and their needs related to the
COVID-19 pandemic specifically. The extent to which these interventions address the needs of the
most vulnerable groups and include gender-sensitive content is also analyzed. The section
presents the assessed interventions in the context of UNICEF’s broader ECD program, highlighting
synergies and complementarities between the different actions.
3.1.1. Relevance to the needs of young children and their families
3.1.1.1. Pregnant women and families with newborn children
“The antenatal and perinatal care, immunization, and HIV testing were the services most
disrupted during the initial phase of the pandemic”, and an immediate reaction was needed to
cope with the related challenges.57Pregnant women and families with a newborn child had limited
information on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on their unborn or newborn children and other
related aspects such as breastfeeding, nutrition, or safe access healthcare services, risk of
infection. As a result, some women were afraid to contact the healthcare facilities under
emergency conditions and experienced anxiety related to restricted access to diagnostic and
other health services, uncertainty whom to address if they or their relatives are infected with
COVID-19, or limited possibilities to buy necessary medications. Many frontline workers did not
know how to approach them in these new circumstances.58
The evaluation findings show that the UNICEF intervention
directed at the COVID-19 response for women and their children
in 12 perinatal centers from the Republic of Moldova was highly
relevant to the health needs of pregnant and breastfeeding
women. The intervention included online training courses for
healthcare staff on referral and inpatient and outpatient care of
pregnant and lactating women in the context of the COVID-19
pandemic and the provision of hygiene supplies to perinatal
services. In addition, frontline workers learned the latest protocols
on infection prevention and control (IPC) at the primary
healthcare level and the HIV testing services, especially for
pregnant women in the context of the pandemic.
According to frontline workers who took part in the evaluation survey, the training was
appropriate to the current health needs of different women and their children in perinatal
centers, including the most vulnerable families. With relevant knowledge and skills gained from

the training, frontline workers could provide precise and reliable information about COVID-19 and
i ts potential impact on their health. Accordingly, the information and quality support received by
pregnant women served as stress-reducing and comfort-adding factors in an emergency and
made them less vulnerable to COVID-19 health-related and psychological implications.59 The
healthcare staff’s preparation was perceived as helpful in supporting women to overcome their
anxiety and reservations in contacting health service providers during the pandemic.
Consequently, together with the online mode of delivery, the well-prepared staff was emphasized
by Key Informants as a factor that increased the accessibility of pre- and post-natal healthcare.
A factor that ensured an alignment of training content with frontline workers’ expectations
was a needs reconnaissance carried out by UNICEF. When the pandemic started, the MHLSP
experts and healthcare workers from perinatal services and primary healthcare were asked
about needs and suggestions to better cope with the emergency. Key Informant interviews
revealed that frontline workers require more information on approaching the healthcare
challenges mentioned above and provide pregnant women and mothers of newborns with
adequate support. The online trainings were developed on the basis of these findings.
3.1.1.2. Preschool children and their families
The outbreak of the COVID-19 created considerable barriers to accessing education for the
youngest children and their families in Moldova. It disrupted the educational services and
limited the access of many children to quality learning. Preschools across the country were
closed from March until September 2020, shifting the locus of early childhood education from
kindergartens to households for seven months. Caregivers of the youngest children were often
unprepared to organize the time of their children and provide quality learning based on their
age needs. One reason for this was the generally limited engagement of caregivers in their
children’s early education rooted in the widespread belief that education is exclusively the state's
responsibility. Coupled with other pandemic-related challenges, including loss of income and
health-related concerns, a sense of frustration and a feeling of being “left on their own” could be
observed among many caregivers.60
The evaluation results show that the objectives of assessed UNICEF interventions in the
preschool education sector were in line with the changing needs of parents and young children
caused by the pandemic. They focused on preparing a safe environment for re-opening
preschool facilities, strengthening the capacities of preschool staff and parents, addressing the
educational needs of the most vulnerable groups of children, and – more broadly – building a
more resilient education system.
Safe preschool environment
A UNICEF U-report poll on parents' needs during the COVID-19 pandemic from June 2020 found
that communication with children about COVID-19 was a challenge reported by the largest share
of respondents.61 Only 32% of the respondents said that they did not face challenges in this regard.
The share of parents facing challenges in communication with their children about COVID-19 was

higher in rural districts than urban communities. Parents' needs for precise information and
g uidance became even more pronounced when preschools re-opened. According to Key
Informants, “parents needed more information on how to communicate with their children on
virus and protection measures; how safe is the kindergarten and what rules need to be respected
for keeping children safe and healthy; how they need to act if their children get infected or had
contact with infected ones”.
In addition to health-related concerns, parents of young children did not always know how to
meet their children's learning needs during the remote online schooling process, as Key
Informants revealed.
To address the need of preschool children and their families to return to a safe learning
environment as soon as possible, UNICEF worked on preparedness and response measures for
the education sector. One of these interventions focused on building capacities of more than
30,000 managerial, didactic and non-didactic staff from preschool facilities, as well as local
public authorities (LPAs). Via online training, mentoring sessions, and other activities, they learned
about COVID-19 IPC measures for children, adults, education, and care provision in the context of
the pandemic. In addition, a guide for preschool children parents on "Organization of learning
and care process in preschools during COVID-19 pandemic"62 was developed. It provided 150,000
parents and caregivers with information on safe hygiene practices, protocols, and regulations to
protect young children from and prevent the spread of COVID-19 once preschools re-open.
Piloting the guideline for parents in five rayons of the country helped adjust its content to the
parents' needs and made the guideline more accessible. As such, it responded to the need of
families with young children for basic information on COVID-19 and guidance on communicating
the pandemic-related messages to their children.
Chairing the UN Coordinated Education Task Force for COVID-19, UNICEF supported the Ministry of
Education, Culture and Research in developing i) the COVID-19 preparedness and response plan
to manage the COVID-19 situation in education and ii) the Regulations for re-opening preschools.
The Regulations covered the preventive measures that preschool institutions were to
undertake to ensure safe operation and minimize the risk of infection among children and
staff. They also included an action plan and activities for re-opening the preschool facilities
gradually. Another intervention with a similar focus, “Preventing and Responding to COVID-19 in
selected countries in Europe and Central Asia”, ensured the provision of supplies and
awareness-raising and capacity building activities for children, teachers, frontline
professionals, parents, caregivers, and LPAs’ representatives on the best hygiene practices
and protocols to prevent the spread of COVID-19 once schools reopen.
Vulnerable families in a spotlight
The lockdown and the closure of preschool facilities disproportionally affected the most
impoverished families, families with children with disabilities, and families from ethnic
minorities. The most impoverished households did not have access to computers, mobile
phones, and the internet, limiting their children's access to education. In addition, some parents
did not know how to use computers and online platforms. The PwC survey showed that only 20%
of the poor households had enough IT devices, and only 15% were comfortable using the

COUNTRY REPORT: MOLDOVA
educational platforms required,63 which restrained educators from providing remote education
a nd guidance to parents. The preschools' closure also meant that some families lost the
opportunity to offer their children a proper meal.64
Parents of children with disabilities were another group heavily affected by the preschools'
closure. They faced various behavioral-, communication-, and learning-related issues
concerning their children, accompanied by fear, psychological problems, and sometimes loss of
the single support service they received.
A UNDP assessment of the socio-economic
impact of the pandemic in Moldova revealed
that the lack of physical equipment for remote
education and limited support on behalf of the
parents could increase the inequalities in
educational outcomes between the
impoverished and prosperous households, as well as between the households from urban and
rural areas.65
The assessed interventions prioritized the needs of the most vulnerable and affected groups of
children and their families. For instance, the intervention on strengthening capacities of
preschool staff, parents, and LPAs to ensure a state of preparedness and response to the COVID-
19 pandemic encouraged the kindergarten managers and LPAs to prioritize the return to re-
opened preschools of children from low-income families, children with disabilities, and children
living in remote rural areas. This approach allowed parents from vulnerable groups to return to
work, which was an important stress relief factor as some had to take unpaid leave to care for
their children.
Roma caregivers and families with children with disabilities were among the most vulnerable
groups targeted specifically in dealing with anxiety and skills related to homeschooling and
parenting in a crisis. As one preschool representative noted: “[…] the parents got stressed
because they lost their jobs or they wouldn’t receive their salaries. The children got tired of simple
play or using the phone, they wanted to socialize with other children. This caused anxiety [within
a family]. Through the trainings that we had, parents learned what to do with children while they
are not in a kindergarten”.
With the introduction of online sessions on positive parenting to the caregivers of young children,
the intervention responded to the caregivers’ need for guidance on organizing educational
activities for their children at home. Caregivers received guidance on organizing daily routines
in pandemic conditions and playing and interacting with their children to support their physical,
psychomotor, social, emotional, mental, and linguistic development. The training content also
covered issues related to managing emotions, providing psycho-emotional support for young
children’s caregivers. These topics were highly relevant to the beneficiaries, according to Key
Informants, because the lack of daycare and other pandemic-related challenges caused high
levels of anxiety among many caregivers, often leading to adverse effects on family life, including

violence against children, and thus on the emotional well-being of children. In addition, to
a ddress the digital exclusion of most Roma families in Moldova, the ICT equipment for Roma
caregivers was provided in preschools to participate in parenting sessions and access advice
on positive discipline at home and maintaining mental hygiene during the crisis.66
Finally, vulnerable families and children with disabilities were the main target groups who
received protective equipment and supplies. For example, as part of UNICEF’s “Development of
early intervention services for young children with developmental delays and disabilities at the
regional level, phase 2” project, 225 vulnerable families with children with disabilities received
WASH, diaper and basic living supplies, while the Voinicel Resource Centre – protective
equipment and sanitizers for prevention of infection during of service provision.
Women and caregiving roles
The closure of preschools increased the burden on women, many of whom had to quit their jobs
and stay home to take care of their children. The loss of income increased the inequality of
women and their vulnerability to abuses and violence. As per UN Women research on gender
roles, domestic violence during lockdown has also become a cause for concern for about half of
the population. With the spreading of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown, the risk
of domestic violence increased. Women were the most affected in this regard, about half of them
fearing it.67 An increase in violence against children was also reported, especially in vulnerable
communities, such as Roma families. According to Key Informants, most Roma parents require
support in developing more positive parenting skills such as non-violent methods of discipline,
as violence increased during the pandemic, causing stressful experiences for children.
The trainings in Social inclusion of Roma children and children with disabilities project
incorporated gender-sensitive content, which was assessed as relevant by Key Informants,
especially in the context of fathers’ limited engagement in their child’s early education. The
training participants were instructed on the importance of lessening the care burden on the
female caregivers and fathers’ active role in this process. In two other interventions that have
been assessed more in-depth, issues related to gender equality and domestic violence during
the pandemic were not integrated into the training content. In case of preschool staff capacity-
building, the Key Informants said that gender aspects were out of its scope and purpose. As for
perinatal centers’ personnel, the need for such components was confirmed by the respondents
and future training content will include post-partum depression and violence against children.
Addressing gender equality issues in a more targeted way by taking into account the division of
roles in a household, including care responsibilities over children, was indicated as a component
that is lacking in training for healthcare staff.
3.1.2. Relevance to the needs of frontline workers
3.1.2.1. Frontline healthcare workers
The healthcare system in Moldova, as in many other countries around the globe, was not
prepared for the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of the main challenges faced during the health
emergency caused by COVID-19 included suspension or shortcutting many essential health

services due to limited capacities of hospitals and limited capacities of healthcare facilities’
m anagers to run the institutions during emergencies. The system was also affected by the lack
of clear protocols for such emergency circumstances, limited access to protective equipment
and disinfectants, and other, long-standing, systemic shortcomings such as shortages in
healthcare staff, outdated infrastructure, weak logistics, fragile communication, and trust.68
The frontline healthcare workers were among the groups most affected by this new crisis
situation. In the context of the shortages mentioned above, the frontline healthcare workers
urgently needed technical, professional, and psychological support to work in these challenging
conditions. They also lacked protective equipment and COVID-19 specific guidance to respond to
emergency in healthcare safely.
Acting as one of the main partners of the MHLSP in the health and education fields, UNICEF
addressed some of the major needs of healthcare frontline workers in capacity-building and
access to PPE equipment. In case of the latter, a review of documents from the CO in Moldova
shows that UNICEF, in partnership with other donors, managed the procurement and delivery of
the largest share of PPE support to key frontline medical workers, police, social workers, and
vulnerable communities. This included, among others, supplies of masks, respirators, face shields,
aprons, gowns, thermo-scanners, items for managing medical waste, and essential
WASH/hygiene supplies.69
The Country Office’s efforts in increasing the frontline healthcare workers' skills in operating in
new emergency conditions were highly appreciated by the healthcare staff. The evaluation
survey results show that the participants in the training on in-patient and out-patient care in
Moldova’s 12 perinatal centers during COVID-19 found it relevant to their needs because it
addressed the most pressing issues. The highly pertinent topics in the context of COVID-19
included nutrition during pregnancy and support for breastfeeding women, referral and
inpatient/outpatient care of pregnant and lactating women, and the latest protocols on infection
prevention and control at the primary healthcare level. The Key Informants highlighted the
usefulness of training for adapting the disrupted healthcare services to the emergency situation,
better responding to women queries and needs, minimizing the infection, and receiving adequate
treatment.
"We did not experience COVID-19 in the past and we were learning along the way. For example,
initially, we did not know if the infection can be transmitted or not through breast milk. It was a
big challenge for infected lactating women to continue breastfeeding. The training covered the
[COVID-related] issues and the frontline workers learned how to communicate with pregnant
women, with women with newborn children in such a way that they will feel comfortable,
knowledgeable, will behave properly, and will stay healthy jointly with their child.”70
In addition, the intervention also helped the frontline healthcare workers to clarify some aspects
related to the implementation of the MHLSP Order N385 issued on April 9, 2020, on health
assistance provided to persons with COVID-19 at the stage of community transmission of the
infection. As such, it responded to their need for guidance on implementing this order in

practice, including pregnant women’s algorithms on triage, testing to COVID-19, reference
m echanism, as well as a treatment.
However, the evaluation’s findings revealed that some urgent frontline healthcare workers' needs
are yet to be addressed. Concerns that remain include, among others, outdated technologies
and equipment, working long hours due to limited human resources caused by infections or
quarantine, difficulties to combining the training with workers’ job responsibilities, and limited
access (if any) to some support services for frontline workers’ children when working long hours
or staying in isolation to protect family members. At the same time, new issues have emerged,
connected mainly to the transition into a digital mode of service provision. They include limited
or no access to laptops, smartphones, internet platforms, and the internet in general. In addition,
since the delivery of some healthcare services was transferred online, sufficient training on how
to use both laptops and healthcare platforms is necessary to realize the full potential offered by
this new mode of delivery.
3.1.2.2. Frontline educational workers
Frontline educational workers also faced many challenges during the pandemic. These were
mainly related to the closure of schools and preschools, remote education, access to protective
equipment, knowledge about COVID-19 infection, and provision of educational services in an
emergency health situation. According to Key Informants, the main concerns of frontline workers
during the pandemic refer to education quality, safety, and relations with parents. More
specifically, substantial questions raised by teachers were related to providing qualitative online
and face-to-face education based on children's needs, ensuring children and staff’s safety in
kindergartens when reopened (e.g., limited knowledge on COVID-19 infection and limited access
to protective equipment). They also sought advice on supporting parents to adapt to the new
situation, become more involved in the education of their children, and cope with their new tasks
and stress related to the new situation.
Another equally important issue was how to make education more inclusive and accessible for
disadvantaged students (e.g., Roma and children with disabilities). This coincides with the
limited capacity of preschool professionals to work with children with special educational needs,
mentioned as one of the main barriers to access to education by the surveyed preschool
principals and teachers. Other most frequently mentioned challenges included the lack of
appropriate infrastructure and equipment and a lack of acceptance (including bullying) of
children of special educational needs by other preschool children and families.
Those concerns were accompanied by a set of limitations of technical nature such as insufficient
digital skills among preschool staff and limited access to technical equipment (e.g., computers),
and sufficient internet connectivity to be trained and deliver services online.
UNICEF-supported adaptations and interventions in the field of education addressed many of
these concerns. They involved support for policy development, technical documents and
guidelines, provision of capacity building programs, direct support to vulnerable families and
children, and provision of protective equipment and sanitizers to preschool facilities.
One of the assessed interventions on strengthening capacities of preschool staff, parents, and
LPAs to better prepare for response to the COVID-19 pandemic addressed the preschool teachers
and LPAs’ need for ensuring safe conditions for preschools reopening during the emergency.
The training content was in line with the "Regulations for implementation of Instructions for
/ 34
MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION
COUNTRY REPORT: MOLDOVA
reopening early education facilities within the context of COVID-19" and covered the preventive
m easures to be undertaken by preschool institutions to ensure their safe operation and minimize
the risks of infection among enrolled children and staff. According to Key Informants, the
training was practical and tailored to the professional needs of didactic and non-didactic staff
and LPAs to help them adjust their work activities to new conditions. Similar findings emerged
from a survey with frontline workers, where over 70% of the respondents said that the training
met their information needs in four areas: applying the regulations for re-opening preschools in
practice (87%); using hygiene equipment for the prevention and control of COVID-19 (84%);
informing parents about safe hygiene practices (82%) and
adapting pedagogical approaches to ensure quality interaction
with and between children in the context of strict prevention
measures (73%). 71 The training participants also received
information on how COVID-19 can spread, symptoms of infection
among children and adults, protection measures, individual
hygiene rules, social distancing, and actions to be followed in
case somebody is infected or was in contact with infected people.
The majority of non-didactical staff (i.e., educator's assistants,
security guards, cooks, and cleaners) considered the training
valuable in providing new knowledge and tips. For those more
familiar with safety measures (i.e., methodologists, medical
assistants, and fire operators), the training offered guidance on
applying the knowledge they already had in practice.
The preschool teachers’ needs related to providing quality services to vulnerable children and
engaging with caregivers during the pandemic were addressed by the intervention on social
inclusion of Roma children and children with disabilities in the Western Balkans. While this was a
broader project, not explicitly focused on the pandemic, it went through adjustments to fit the
new situation. In terms of content, it provided preschool teachers with information and advice on
providing education to children with disabilities and developmental delays in their kindergarten,
also during the COVID-19 pandemic. The frontline workers welcomed the coaching component
on supporting caregivers during the pandemic, both methodologically and emotionally. In their
view, remote education made it even more difficult for frontline workers to reach caregivers and
engage with them in cooperation for the benefit of their children. Further, the shift to online
training and mentoring sessions from March 2020 was assessed by frontline workers as
appropriate. According to 94% of the respondents, the online mode of training delivery made
their participation possible/easier. However, a preference for face-to-face training was clear
among Key Informants and survey participants (92% of respondents), the majority of whom
indicated that future similar trainings should take place outside the virtual world. One reason for
this was that sometimes the lack of face-to-face contact results in a limited interaction between
the trainers and training participants.
Despite these developments, additional needs for a more efficient learning process emerged
among educators in the course of the pandemic. Among the more pressing issues, the Key
Informants listed, were a need for methodologies and guidelines to adapt the learning process
to pandemic conditions and implement online education for children with disabilities and special
71 Based on the evaluation survey with frontline education workers.

educational needs. Additional training on using ICT technologies and online platforms and
a ccessing professional learning platforms was also mentioned. UNICEF’s commitment in this area
has already started.
3.1.3. Relevance to UNICEF’s broader ECD and COVID-19
programming
UNICEF’s interventions in health and education during the pandemic period are highly
consistent with goals and expected ECD outcomes at the country level. They are in line with
UNICEF Country Programme 2018-2022 priorities in health (promotion of improved child survival,
growth and development, good nutrition and vaccination), education (expand preschool
education, make schools child friendly and promote inclusive education), and child protection
(end violence against children by improving parenting education).
The training of frontline workers in health and education is perceived to be in line with UNICEF-
Moldova Country Programme for 2018-2022, Outcome 1 - Equitable, child-sensitive systems, and
services and Outcome 2 - Social change for child right. In the case of Outcome 1, the interventions
contributed to the implementation of the following outputs: 1) by 2022, the health system is to
improve capacity to generate demand and provide quality maternal and newborn, child and
adolescent health services, including outreach, and to advise caregivers supporting childcare,
growth, and development, and 2) by 2022, schools and preschools can apply and monitor quality
teaching and learning and can address violence, dropout and absenteeism. In the case of
Outcome 2, the interventions contributed to implementing the following output: by 2022,
caregivers in selected districts have the capacity and skills to take responsibility for child care,
health, development, education and protection, and encourage and practice positive behavior.
UNICEF interventions are integrated in Moldova United Nations Partnership Framework for
Sustainable Development (2018-2022) under Outcome 1: The people of Moldova, in particular the
most vulnerable, demand and benefit from democratic, transparent and accountable
governance, gender-sensitive, human rights- and evidence-based public policies, equitable
services, and efficient, effective and responsive public institutions; and Outcome 4: The people
of Moldova, in particular the most vulnerable, demand and benefit from gender-sensitive and
human rights-based, inclusive, effective and equitable quality education, health and social
policies and services. They contribute to the implementation of Sustainable Development Goals
1 (No poverty), 3 (Good Health and Well-being, especially Targets 3.1. and 3.2., related to lowering
maternal, neonatal and under-five mortality), 4 (Quality Education, especially Target 4.2 related
to ensuring that all girls and boys have access to quality early childhood development, care, and
pre-primary education ), 5 (Gender equality), 8 (Decent work and economic growth) and 10
(Reduced inequalities).
Implementation of those interventions aligns with the Moldovan government’s obligations
under CEDAW and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). The former, especially Article
12(1), obliges State Parties to “ensure to women appropriate services in connection with
pregnancy”. The CRC, in turn, compels the state authorities to provide quality and inclusive
education to children, including young children, and “ensure that all children have access to the
highest attainable standard of health care and nutrition during their early years”. As noted by
the Committee on the Rights of the Child, “States parties must ensure that the institutions,
services and facilities responsible for early childhood conform to quality standards […] and that
/ 36

staff possess the appropriate psychosocial qualities and are suitable, sufficiently numerous and
w ell-trained.” (General Comment no. 7).
The interventions are integrated into Gov ernmental annual action plans and are part of more
extensive governmental and donors’ efforts to ensure safe access to health services and early
learning and care for young children during the COVID-19 pandemic: 1) Government COVID-19
Emergency Response Plan72; 2) MECR’s “Preparedness and Response Plan for the Management of
COVID-19 Situation in Education“; 3) Moldova COVID-19 Response and Recovery Window under
the Moldova 2030 SDGs Multi-Partner Trust Fund. In the case of the Government COVID-19
Emergency Response Plan, the training program of frontline workers in the health and education
sectors contributed to better implementation of infection control protocols in healthcare and
preschool facilities, and prevention of COVID-19 infections.
The positive parenting sessions introduced in response to COVID-19 are part of the MECR’s
“Preparedness and Response Plan for the Management of COVID-19 Situation in Education”.
The plan was developed and is being implemented with the support of UNICEF. The following
actions completed as part of the plan display particularly strong complementarities with the
intervention:
• Development, approval, and implementation of the “Methodology on organizing the process
of distance learning during quarantine in early education institutions”;
• Development, approval, and roll out of the “Guidelines on providing psychological support to
children/pupils, parents and teachers during the period when the educational process is
suspended”;
• Development of “Methodological guidelines on healthy lifestyle during quarantine”;
• Distribution of educational kits for young children with disabilities and Roma children.73
3.2. Effectiveness
Despite a short timeframe available for planning and preparing the response, UNICEF-supported
ECD interventions introduced or adapted to the COVID-19 pandemic in Moldova achieved notable
results. This section highlights achievements and areas that need further attention in different
dimensions of effectiveness when responding to an emergency like COVID-19 such as:
development of frontline workers’ capacity, supporting them through mentoring/supervision and
guidance, provision of necessary equipment, and monitoring and evaluation of their progress.
3.2.1. Frontline workers’ capacity and skills
The evaluation evidence shows that the pandemic-caused adaptations in ECD services were
effective in terms of improving frontline workers' knowledge and skills. Most frontline workers
who took part in the evaluation surveys assessed the capacity-building activities in the COVID-
19 context as leading to such an improvement. They implement the knowledge and skills gained

from the trainings in their daily work as ECD professionals and feel prepared to carry out their
w ork during the pandemic. At the same time, one and a half years after the pandemic started,
they are also aware of further support needed to be fully equipped to respond to the emergency
situation and continue service provision in challenging circumstances.
3.2.1.1. Working in a health emergency context
The review of UNICEF’s documentation indicates that thanks to UNICEF’s support, thousands of
healthcare workers and teaching and nonteaching personnel at the pre-primary level
increased their knowledge and practical skills regarding COVID-19 regulations, protocols for
COVID-19, and infectious diseases prevention and control. Similar findings emerged from the
Key Informant interviews and survey responses gathered throughout the evaluation process.
More specifically, the majority of respondents from didactic and non-didactic preschool staff
trained on applying the COVID-19-related measures for re-opening the preschools reported they
feel fully prepared to i) use the tools to prevent and control COVID-19 and other infectious
diseases, ii) apply the Regulations for the re-opening of preschools in practice, and iii) inform
parents about safe hygiene practices, protocols, and regulations, and to adapt pedagogical
approaches to strict infection prevention measures, iv) adapt the preschool’s facilities and
activities to emergency conditions for increasing safety of staff and children.74 As for the training
benefits for frontline healthcare workers, the Key Informants mentioned developing innovative
approaches for following antenatal standards of care (face-to-face and online contacts with
pregnant women), ii) composing a detailed plan on provision of antenatal services face-to-face
and remotely; and iii) providing assistance and services to pregnant women with COVID-19 or
with suspicion of COVID-19 infection.
“I think, based on feedback, around 80% of healthcare workers adapted their attitudes and
behaviors to pandemic conditions during the next three months after the training.”75
The frontline workers apply the knowledge and skills gained from the training in their daily
work as ECD professionals. For instance, most survey respondents who took part in a training
that concerned perinatal and postnatal services during the COVID-19 pandemic said that they
apply “to a large extent” this knowledge and skills in their work as health professionals during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Similar findings come from didactic and non-didactic preschool staff
trained on applying the COVID-19-related measures to re-open preschools. More than 90% of
those who took part in the survey (n=128) agreed that they do so. The practical training sessions
linked to job responsibilities helped the non-didactic staff integrate the safety rules in their daily
routine to protect themselves and the children from COVID-19.76 According to Key Informants, the
follow-up meetings and mentoring sessions confirmed that most training participants have a
high level of understanding of the risks of COVID-19 infection and are implementing the
knowledge they received during the training in their daily lives, including at their job.
The evidence gathered from interviews indicates that the assessed interventions increased
frontline workers’ skills to communicate with and support caregivers on a range of issues
related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Such preparation was especially valuable for managing
relations with caregivers who experienced various anxieties about caring for and educating their

children during the crisis. For instance, the frontline healthcare workers in perinatal care said they
h ad increased their skills in counseling infected mothers to breastfeed their children in safe
conditions, as well as on the nutrition of pregnant women and babies.
"We received good feedback from training participants. They said that the received knowledge
would support them to have better communication with their patients. Some people participated
twice in the same training to better understand the content and have the possibility to discuss
more with trainers and their colleagues on how to address COVID-19 challenges."77
The frontline workers are now better prepared to address better the needs of the most
vulnerable children and families. In the perinatal care, 2/3 of evaluation survey respondents
(n=14) said that due to the training they increased their skills and knowledge very much or much
to deliver services to this group (around 1/3 noticed an increase to some extent). In the preschool
sector, more than half of the frontline education workers (51%, n=49) who learned about early
education for children with special educational needs and positive parenting said they were fully
prepared to work with children with disabilities and developmental delays, followed by 49% who
felt somewhat or to some extent prepared. They also felt sufficiently equipped to provide child-
centered education during the COVID-19 pandemic (65% of parental educators).78
The evaluation did not gather conclusive data on the effects of the positive parenting sessions
for Roma caregivers and their children specifically. One interviewed stakeholder who worked in a
preschool institution with Roma children expressed doubts about the training’s effectiveness for
these families. Among frontline workers who responded to the survey, 17% (n=49) said that the
training and mentoring sessions did not prepare them at all to work with Roma children, while
more than half of respondents (57%) felt somewhat or to some extent prepared. The share of
those who were fully prepared constitutes ¼ of the survey respondents (26%). Accordingly, the
evaluation survey respondents declared that among the primary skills they need to further
improve to deliver inclusive education to vulnerable children are skills to effectively communicate
and engage with parents (68%, n=41) and expert skills to provide education services to children
with disabilities (63%, n=41).
More promising results of other activities within the project for Roma children occurred. CNETIF’s
efforts to map all Roma children and children with disabilities around the 44 pilot kindergartens
and to advocate with local authorities and preschools resulted in the enrolment of additional 159
young Roma children and 89 children with special education needs into preschools.
The interviews and results from the pre- and post-training surveys show that the training on
positive parenting practices increased the frontline education workers’ ability to support
caregivers. As explained by Key Informants, they learned about what advice to provide to parents
regarding talking to their children about the COVID-19 pandemic and explaining the necessity of
staying at home, organizing a safe environment and early education at home (also through play),
using non-violent disciplining methods, personal hygiene, and dealing with toxic stress and
psychological well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic, transition, and recovery period.
Comparable findings were gathered from the evaluation survey where more than 50% of the
respondents (54%) said that the training and mentoring sessions prepared them to provide
online sessions for caregivers on positive parenting.

By increasing frontline workers’ competences and accessibility of services for their target groups,
the training had an indirect effect on its final beneficiaries – pregnant women, children and their
families, as implied in all Key Informant Interviewees. Although the evaluation did not gather
conclusive data on the effects of the interventions on families and children, some examples
suggest that the trainings increased caregivers' and children’s awareness on education and care
process during and after healthcare and preschool closures.
Firstly, by knowing how to ensure infection control in health and education facilities, they helped
to ensure safe conditions in their facilities, maintain or restart service delivery, and increase safety
of service beneficiaries. For instance, anecdotal evidence suggests that many healthcare workers
started to better organize the triage and testing of infected/non-infected women, which in turn
helped to prevent the spreading of infection. Similar effects were noticed in the education sector,
where “post-training survey shown a high level of knowledge of training participants on how to
ensure safe practices in preschool institutions to prevent the spread of infection”.79 Furthermore,
in addition to didactic and non-didactic staff, the post-training survey has shown that parents
know more about the pandemics preventative and response measures, such as major
symptoms of COVID-19 (more than 90% of surveyed caregivers), proper handwashing
technique (more than 80%), or procedures to follow when a child or any family member is
diagnosed with COVID-19 (more than 80%).80 As a result, preschool facilities could be re-opened
as a safe place for children, which allowed parents of young children, especially mothers, to
return to their work.
Secondly, by learning how to better communicate with service beneficiaries, also online, and
deliver parental education, frontline workers helped caregivers to provide adequate support
and nurturing care to their children, and to deal with the crisis situation. For instance, the
didactic staff learned how effectively to communicate safety rules to young children and their
families and how to educate caregivers of children with disabilities about their child’s special
educational needs. There was a consensus among the respondents that due to improved
awareness and advice received, the trained caregivers are now better prepared to support their
child’s cognitive and emotional development. Asked about more specific benefits of the parental
79 Interview with a Key Informant.

COUNTRY REPORT: MOLDOVA
education sessions for the caregivers,81 the respondents mentioned parents becoming, among
o ther things: more caring and more responsible, more involved in their children’s preschool
education, and more aware of the benefits of positive discipline for their children and of their
own emotions.82 For instance, the share of caregivers who reported that they “never tell their child
that they are worse than another child” also increased (41% before the training to 59% after it). 83
Such findings are particularly important given the attitudes of caregivers of children with
disabilities or developmental delays in Moldova who often struggle to see the strengths of their
child.84
Finally, in parallel to these positive findings, the survey of frontline workers shows that the majority
of them still need to improve some of their skills to deliver services effectively. For instance,
frontline healthcare workers need more training on testing in ambulatory conditions, acting in
emergencies, and inter-institutional collaboration (perinatological center – ambulatory –
maternity). Another concern that has not been tackled is the abuse and violence in households,
which increased during the pandemic. Due to the emergency mode of operation, limited time
for the preparation of the training, and the high number of subjects to be
covered, the assessed intervention did not cover enough aspects related
to abuse and violence in households and they are to be addressed
during similar interventions. The didactic and preschool staff, in turn,
need more information on i) adapting learning curriculums and training
materials to a context of strict measures to limit the infection, and ii)
engagement and communication with caregivers; iii) effects on
vaccination. In case of the latter, engaging health professionals in
providing training on health safety (and vaccination) issues to preschool
staff would increase trust in received information on health protection, in
the interviewees’ opinion. Sharing additional information on vaccination
with parents would also be helpful to address their concerns related to
this issue. Some parents of children with disabilities or special needs are
still afraid of sending their children to kindergartens after the re-opening and do not trust the
effectiveness of the vaccines.85
3.2.1.2. Applying innovative solutions
Shifting capacity-building activities and services online was the most innovative
development among the assessed interventions. As pointed out by Key Informants, due to the
online learning experience, the frontline healthcare workers learned how to develop i) innovative
approaches for following antenatal standards of care – hybrid contacts with pregnant women
(face-to-face and online); and ii) a detailed plan on provision of antenatal services face-to-face

and remotely. In addition, anecdotal evidence indicates that many training participants decided
t o overcome their reservations and started to use internet platforms and IT equipment in their
practice to facilitate communication with patients.
Access to learning and skills development was maintained through a rapid shift to an online
mode of training delivery. Specifically, when it comes to the online training format, over 96% of
respondents among preschool staff trained on preparedness and response to the COVID-19
pandemic agreed and strongly agreed that the training and mentoring in an online format made
their participation possible.86
Given the short time for changing the mode of training delivery, the satisfaction of evaluation
survey respondents with the training can be seen as a major achievement. The preschool staff
who participated in the sessions on the education of children with special education needs and
positive parenting mentioned that the information was delivered in a well-structured and
accessible way. Some commended the opportunity to ask questions, make references to real-
world examples, and receive feedback from trainers.
The online format of some trainings was seen as a suitable, if not the only, option in the pandemic,
but for most respondents, face-to-face training is a preferred option. For instance, the online
format of training and mentoring on implementing the regulations on re-opening kindergartens
made it difficult for almost half of the respondents to stay engaged and motivated. Limited
possibility to learn through practical simulations was listed by healthcare workers as a
shortcoming of using remote technology. When the emergency situation is over, a hybrid (online
and face-to-face) format for future trainings will be considered to increase both its efficiency
and accessibility.
The COVID-19 pandemic has sharply increased the demand for digital skills among frontline
workers and exposed needs in this area. All interviewees and survey participants mentioned
insufficient skills related to using remote technologies as a significant hindering factor to benefit
from distance learning fully. For instance, while 81% of Moldova’s kindergarten teachers received
coaching support in applying 16 positive parenting guides, the remaining 19% of preschool
teachers could not be trained due to lack of digital skills required for subsequent delivery of
trainings to the caregivers.87 The need for training on using ICT technologies, equipment, and
online platforms has been highlighted to address such a challenge, alongside better access to IT
tools and a reliable internet connection (for more, please see section 3.2.3).
The increased adoption of remote technology helped to minimize disruptions in the provision of
ECD services during the COVID-19 pandemic-related lockdown and physical distancing
measures. However, frontline education workers still face a lack of clear methodologies and
guidelines for adapting the learning process to pandemic conditions or implementing online
education for children with disabilities and special educational needs. In addition, not all
parents have good digital skills or access to IT tools (e.g., laptops, smartphones), so they cannot
always benefit from the opportunities offered by online service delivery. As reported by Key
Informants, the digital exclusion of many parents and a dislike of online interaction among many
of Moldova’s adults created challenges with ensuring access to online sessions for parents. In
some cases, the online mode of the trainings with parents was reported to have negatively

affected parental engagement in the sessions, particularly in discussions on psycho-emotional
p roblems and disability.
3.2.2. Information and guidance
The evaluation evidence suggests that proper supervision, mentoring sessions, and sharing
experiences among peers are perceived as necessary components of an efficient learning
process. The evaluation feedback from preschool staff trained to ensure a state of preparedness
and response to the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that these activities had a significant impact
on consolidating their knowledge and skills from the training. The main benefits gained were
exchanging experiences with the trainer and their peers (48%) and solidifying the knowledge
gained during the training (37%, n=123). The possibility of asking questions to the trainer was also
mentioned among the benefits by some of the respondents (15%). Among issues shared during
the mentoring sessions were: implementing the training material in practice, practical exercises
and methodological tools used to better transfer the information on COVID-19 to children of
different ages, or various strategies on achieving learning objectives while respecting safety
rules. As highlighted by the interviewees, only by following learned and understood procedures
was it possible to prevent the infection of children and staff. It should also be mentioned that the
professionalism of trainers and their good presentations (including the presentation of trainers
from the National Agencies for Public Health and Food Security) was listed among the main
strengths of the capacity-building activities.
At the same time, the evaluation findings imply that for future capacity-building activities,
more time and resources for mentoring sessions and follow-up would be recommendable.
Almost 60% of the survey respondents (n=41) representing didactical staff trained in the
implementation of parental education programs admitted that they require better
methodological support, through mentoring and supervision, to do their work. Based on the
limited data collected, it appears that more awareness and coaching sessions are needed to
promote the use of positive parenting practices among Roma families or to deliver inclusive
education to vulnerable children in Moldova, including in the context of a pandemic. The need to
continuously support the preschool teachers and support them in fostering collaborative
relationships with parents was also highlighted by Key Informants.
Although most frontline healthcare workers from perinatal and
postnatal care services who took part in the survey said they
received sufficient support and supervision to deliver their services
effectively, a need for more assistance in this area has also been
reported. Examples of room for improvement included: more
possibilities for providing quick feedback during the online
training, better methodological support to help handle complex
cases, psychological support to help deal with the stress, better
information and guidance in the form of standard operational
procedures like protocols and handbooks, and better mentoring
and supervision in general.
Notable unexpected ripple effects of the intervention occurred in the Călărași district.
According to the final partnership review report, educational materials on inclusive and parental
education used during trainings in the 16 targeted preschools were shared with all schools in the
/ 43
MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION
COUNTRY REPORT: MOLDOVA
district. With the help of the teachers trained in parental education within the project, one early
c hildhood education specialist from Călărași also organized trainings on positive parenting for
all educators from the district. The parental educators from each preschool involved in the
project also helped the rest of the educators from the same preschools to organize trainings with
caregivers.88
Finally, although not officially intended as the effect of the training, improved collaboration
between the healthcare workers has been observed by some respondents and attributed to the
intervention. This includes an increase in online communication among frontline workers and
exchange of expertise and lessons learned. They also organized discussions and meetings at
their workplace to share the acquired knowledge with their colleagues who did not participate in
the training.
3.2.3. ICT and personal protective equipment
Weak digital skills among frontline workers and parents are not only a challenge in Moldova. The
evaluation findings show that the absence of appropriate ICT equipment and devices and
internet access were the most serious constraints to distance learning and the digital mode of
service provision. Reported challenges, highlighted by all respondents irrespective of assessed
intervention, included the absence of or limited access to computers, tablets, phones or
smartphones, internet platforms, and the internet in general. For instance, the inadequate
infrastructure necessary to ensure a good internet connection at kindergartens, healthcare
institutions, and other ECD services was often a disturbing factor for ensuring optimal training
and service provision environment. There were cases where several participants had to share
one computer and needed to keep physical distance, which limited their possibilities to interact
with trainers. To mitigate some of these challenges among parents, UNICEF procured laptops for
children from vulnerable families and the staff of many of the preschools invited the caregivers
to participate in the trainings in the kindergartens, using computers organized for this occasion.
Some trainings were also organized on the weekend to avoid overlaps with the caregivers’
working hours.89 However, financial and material support is necessary to expand the digitalization
of ECD services at the country level, ensuring their continuity and minimizing existing digital
inequalities.
Severe shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) and sanitizers were another serious
challenge in Moldova. To equip frontline workers with the necessary PPE, UNICEF mobilized funds
and managed the procurement and delivery of the largest share of PPE support to key frontline
medical workers, police, social workers, and vulnerable communities. For instance, it provided
sanitizers and PPE supplies to 1300 Primary Healthcare Centers, 29 medical institutions providing
care to pregnant women and newborns, 41 Youth Friendly Health Centers, 12 maternity hospitals,
12 residential schools and institutions for children, including for children with disabilities, 35 District
Psycho-pedagogical Assistance Services, and to 225 vulnerable families benefitting from early
intervention services for young children with developmental delays and disabilities. The Crisis
Centre for women and children, survivors of gender-based violence, received necessary hygiene
items to ensure women and children with qualitative services. Accordingly, food and hygiene

packages were distributed among 300 vulnerable families affected by violence. Yet, despite such
s upport, needs in the WASH area remain. When asked about support they still require, the
surveyed frontline healthcare workers listed medical equipment, PPE, and hygiene supplies,
among others. Management and monitoring
Given the emergency context for making adjustments, the assessed interventions were well
planned to meet the changing needs of frontline health and early childhood education workers
due to the pandemic, as the interviews revealed. They were coordinated with key actors and
stakeholders, such as the MHLSP, MECR, WHO, National Agencies for Public Health and Food
Security, and other UN agencies, to avoid duplication. They were also based on the MHLSP’s
Disposition on the provision of the training, which helped to better manage the organization of
the training and raised their visibility. Representatives of UNICEF and main stakeholders perceived
the communication between the involved parties and training beneficiaries as very efficient,
which affected the training positively. Only in the case of LPAs, administrative units governing
preschools, more engagement in training and discussions was expected.
The findings show that the two trainings targeting frontline workers who work with preschool
children and their families integrated suitable feedback mechanisms that can serve as an
example when organizing other training sessions. These included mentoring and follow-up
sessions, in-training monitoring and supervision of UNICEF, responsible line ministry, public
authorities, and pre-and post-training surveys. In case of the training for healthcare workers, the
Key Informants reported that the only feedback/ monitoring mechanism applied during this
intervention was based on real-time feedback provided by training participants through a chat
option on a training platform and spontaneous phone calls received after the training. They
agreed that the formalized pre- and post-training assessment should be used for future trainings
for better monitoring of training results.
In terms of monitoring the intervention’s potential effect on gender-related aspects, the Key
Informants representing the healthcare sector pointed out the need for better-integrated
monitoring mechanisms to examine this area.
3.3. Sustainability
The sustainability of effects of pandemic-caused adaptations examined in this evaluation was
analyzed from two perspectives: 1) their potential for mainstreaming and last over time; and 2)
their contribution to building more resilient ECD services, better preparation for other challenging
situations, beyond COVID-19. In doing so, the perceptions of respondents on the value and
adequacy of assessed adaptations to respond to future crises were collected, and information
on measures put in place or planned to ensure the sustainability of results.
3.3.1. Sustainability of current responses
Some tangible steps have already been taken to ensure the sustainability of assessed
adaptations introduced in response to COVID-19. There are plans to continue them in a new
format and updated context, make them more targeted, include them in national policies, and
make the learnings available for a wider audience. More detailed actions presented below are
expected to positively impact the sustainability of the ECD sector’s response to the pandemic
and contribute to long-term effectiveness and efficiency in service provision.

COUNTRY REPORT: MOLDOVA
3.3.1.1. Integration into national policies and systems
The experiences from the assessed adaptations to better respond to the COVID-19 emergency
are used as an opportunity to strengthen policies and systems that concern ECD. As such, they
contribute to ensuring the safe access to health services and early learning and care for young
children during the COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically, they are part of larger governmental
and donors efforts such as: i) Government COVID-19 Emergency Response Plan; ii) MECR’s
‘Preparedness and Response Plan for the Management of COVID-19 Situation in Education in
General and Technical Vocational Education’; iii) Moldova COVID-19 Response and Recovery
Window under the Moldova 2030 SDGs Multi-Partner Trust Fund. In addition, chairing the UN
Coordinated Education Task Force for COVID-19, UNICEF responded to the urgent needs of the
Ministry of Education, Culture and Research to address COVID-19 challenges and supported the
development and implementation of the Education Preparedness and Response Plan for the
Management of COVID-19 situation in education and the Regulations for re-opening preschools.
Some recommendations from training participants working in perinatal care have been
integrated into national policies related to COVID-19. The training results, together with the
positive practices and protocols from other countries in the region, served for the development
of Standards for the supervision of pregnant women in ambulatory conditions, approved through
the MHLSP Order N890, as well as for the development of National Clinical Protocols on COVID-19
(editions 1,2,3) with the integration of Algorithm for behavior and testing of newborns from
mothers with COVID-19.
UNICEF also plans to develop and integrate a component related to the prevention of all types
of emergencies into the National Education Strategy for 2021-2030. The results from the Social
Inclusion of Roma Children and Children with Disabilities in the Western Balkans project are also
likely to be supported by the Strategy and the mid-term Action Plan (2021-2025). Both documents
are being developed by the MECR in response to the pandemic, with the support of UNICEF and
the Global Partnership for Education. Setting out a long-term vision for developing Moldova’s
education sector at all levels, the Strategy will build on the lessons learned during the COVID-19
pandemic and strengthen the system’s resilience. As such, the strategy foresees the continuation
of activities aimed at reinforcing the capacities of learners, teachers, parents, and other relevant
stakeholders.90
Other UNICEF-supported activities such as provisions on strengthening WASH systems, including
WASH conditions in educational institutions, can help preschool institutions prevent the spread
of infectious diseases inside and outside their premises. Integrating the set of rules and
procedures for preparedness and response to the COVID-19 pandemic into kindergarten safety
policies would increase its sustainability and the resilience of ECD services, not only during the
current emergency, but also to other challenging situations of similar nature.
3.3.1.2. Continuation of capacity-building based on an updated content and
delivery mode
All assessed interventions envisage the continuation of trainings but with some modifications
that result from the changing needs reported by targeted participants. More emphasis on

building communication skills, psychological well-being, and digital capacities is expected in
t he upcoming events with a hybrid (online and face-to-face) delivery format if the
epidemiological conditions allow.
The training course for healthcare frontline workers from the training course Moldova’s 12
Perinatal centers will be more focused on improving the communication of frontline healthcare
workers with families, women, and children (mainly in a vulnerable situation) on prevention of
infection, vaccination, and treatment. More practical simulations will also be included. Likewise,
the activities that concern strengthening capacities of preschool staff, parents and LPAs to ensure
a state of preparedness and response to the COVID-19 pandemic have been revised to better
match the expectations of frontline workers. The post-training survey revealed that the training
participants have sufficient knowledge and skills on infection prevention and, instead, more focus
on enhancing the digital skills of educators is currently required. According to UNICEF’s Final
Partnership Review Form and interviews with the Key Informants, there is also a need to organize
training programs on supporting the psychological well-being of educators and for local
trainings of trainers on the application of the guidelines for parents of preschoolers. Such
activities are expected to positively impact the intervention’s sustainability and strengthen the
resilience of ECD programs in Moldova.
In addition, more targeted training delivery is envisaged when it comes to groups of training
participants. For instance, the MHLSP plans more training for frontline healthcare workers from
the rural areas as they work with pregnant women in more challenging conditions and their
access to information is limited. Linguistic capacities are also considered as the training
programs will be developed in two languages, Romanian and Russian, and will be delivered in the
Transnistria region. Similarly, all modules on positive parenting are available in both the
Romanian and Russian languages. In addition, capacity-building activities for preschool staff to
ensure the safety of the educational and care processes in education facilities will occur in two
formats: one for those who need advanced skills and another for those requiring more basic skills.
Finally, in response to digital needs exposed by alterations, UNICEF partnered with the Foundation
for Advancement of Moldova to strengthen digital literacy, knowledge and skills of teaching staff
in the preschool education subsector in support of online learning, in order to overcome the
challenges imposed by the epidemiological context. This intervention aims to create a critical
mass of preschool teachers, representing approximately 80% of teaching personnel in pre-
primary institutions, who can confidently use digital skills to search, collect, receive, store and
process information, thus improving their online educational services during the pandemic,
transition, and recovery periods. In addition, another national project on using the Education
Management Information system (EMIS) module will be launched soon.
3.3.1.3. Disseminating experiences and promising practices
Making use of knowledge gained during the COVID-19 crisis by ensuring wider access to created
and accumulated knowledge is an important step towards achieving sustainable outcomes of
assessed interventions. In this sense, activities directed at building a broader understanding
and awareness among peer frontline workers and a wider audience promoted the
sustainability of the results and measures in question. Constituting an integral part of the
evaluated adaptations, they promoted issues such as patient care in the context of the
pandemic, the best hygiene practices and protocols, or organizing educational activities for
children at home, all of which are applicable beyond a group of training participants.

MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION
COUNTRY REPORT: MOLDOVA
As part of the COVID-19 response for women and their children in Moldova’s 12 Perinatal Centers,
U NICEF intends to develop a video library with training content, recorded sessions, and a
separate “questions and answers” session to better disseminate the training content among
non-participants. A similar video library developed for different training has been considered by
healthcare workers as very useful and efficient. According to Key Informants for the Strengthening
capacities of preschool staff, parents and LPAs to ensure a state of preparedness and response
to the COVID-19 pandemic project, the intervention's sustainability has been supported
through the extensive distribution of training packages and by posting all developed
information materials, including the guide for parents, on the MECR and Chisinau municipality
websites. Comparable conclusions can be drawn from other UNICEF CO activities reviewed, such
as the development of methodological guidance regarding the online trainings on positive
parenting, informational materials on positive parenting during the COVID-19 pandemic, and a
paper on lessons learned from the education sector’s response to COVID-19. The latter offers a
collection of facts and consequences that concern the pandemics immediate impact on the
education sector in Moldova, a summary of country and development partners’ responses, and
ideas for the way forward to “build back better” by grasping the opportunities the learning crisis
presents to build a more resilient education system.91
There are also signs that learnings from some interventions were drawn and may be used in the
implementation of future initiatives. As stated by one Implementing Partner representative, based
on the pre- and post-training assessment results, recommendations and suggestions were
formulated for future similar programs. According to the respondent, the recommendations are
tailor-made for all preschool staff categories (educators, educators’ assistants, auxiliary
personnel). However, at the moment of writing this Country Report, it was unclear whether these
recommendations were widely shared with other stakeholders.
3.3.1.4. Ongoing collaboration between stakeholders
The cooperation between interventions’ implementers and participants can become an
opportunity to extend their contacts beyond the project timelines. This is the case of the “Social
Inclusion of Roma Children and Children with Disabilities in the Western Balkans project”,
where some crucial collaborations formed during the implementation of the intervention will
continue. Notably, specialists from the Psycho-pedagogical Assistance Service within the target
districts’ Education Directorates collaborated with preschool teachers to implement education
practices presented in the seven guides. This specific work ended in 2020, but the collaboration
between the Psycho-pedagogical Assistance Services and the kindergartens continues. Also, in
the case of the trainings for preschool staff, parents, and LPAs to ensure a state of
preparedness and response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the cross-sectorial cooperation
developed for designing and delivering this intervention will continue. As reported by Key
Informants, it will “serve as a sustainable mechanism for supporting young children and their
families in the recovery and post-pandemic period". As the unintended effects of the training,
public authorities from several communities, in a joint effort, requested the central government
to support them to create the required conditions for re-opening preschool facilities. As a result,
they received permission from the Ministry of Finance to use unspent budgets for building inside
toilets, constructing water pipe systems, procurement of boilers for hot water, procurement of

sanitizers, or procurement of computers. It can be concluded that the training helped create a
c ommunity spirit in preschool facilities and local administration, where everybody feels
responsible and accountable for ensuring safety rules to keep children and staff safe, and in
consequence, it helped to improve the overall infrastructure.
3.3.2. Current responses’ contribution to resilient ECD systems
Due to the relatively short implementation period of the assessed adaptations, it is difficult to
assess how they contribute to the strengthening of country ECD systems and their resilience in
the long run. However, based on the views of respondents who participated in the evaluation, it
can be expected that the interventions assessed add to more resilient and effective ECD services
beyond the public health emergency context. Accordingly, they can serve as examples of a
coordinated and prompt response to various emergencies.
The evaluation findings show that the competencies acquired by
frontline workers as a result of the assessed interventions can be
applied beyond the COVID-19 context. A vast majority of surveyed
frontline workers (86%) from the health and preschool education
sectors said that the assessed interventions would be useful in other
public health emergencies beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. It can be
therefore expected that the upcoming courses will further enhance their
capacity to deliver healthcare and educational services in other crisis
settings, beyond COVID-19. The respondents agreed that having staff
who know how to respond to health emergencies makes their
institutions better prepared to deal with future shocks and crises, and,
in consequence, adds to a stronger and more resilient ECD system.
According to the Key Informants and the majority of surveyed frontline
healthcare workers who benefited from the intervention targeting
Moldova’s 12 perinatal centers, the training course improved their
capacities to deliver perinatal and postnatal care services to women
and their children in crisis settings, beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, and
should continue even after the pandemic is over. Although the basic training materials were
adapted to the COVID-19 situation, after small modifications, they can be used for any other
healthcare emergency. The training subjects covered many important issues that are applicable
in other, non-COVID-related situations (e.g., management and organization of services, infection
control, breastfeeding, nutrition of pregnant women and babies, inpatient and outpatient
perinatal and post-natal care). Analogously, the trainings topics for preschool staff, parents, and
LPAs to ensure a state of preparedness and response to the COVID-19 pandemic covered many
essential aspects that apply to other contexts, like infection control in preschool facilities,
communication with children and parents, and more. By increasing the knowledge and skills of
all stakeholders on staying safe and providing quality services, the capacity-building
programme helped the authorities share responsibilities and make all actors accountable for
their actions. The Key Informants agreed that integrating this intervention in kindergarten safety
policies would increase its sustainability and the resilience of ECD centers in other emergencies.
In addition to building the capacity of frontline workers, some interventions, such as the Social
Inclusion of Roma Children and Children with Disabilities in the Western Balkans project, have a
/ 49

wider objective that aim to “improve the overall enabling and institutional environment […] with
r espect to sustainability and equity of service provision”. 92 To achieve progress at institutional-,
policy-, and system-level, the project also includes advocacy and technical assistance to
increase the local authorities’ budgets for preschool education by 2%. This achievement is
expected to improve the overall conditions for preschool workers for further strengthening and
using their skills in providing early education to children with special educational needs (SEN)
and other vulnerable children.
Finally, a promising option for effective and long-lasting delivery of training, identified by Key
Informants, could be the online capacity-building platform for frontline healthcare workers.
Such a platform should have an integrated training needs assessment questionnaire and
feedback mechanism, and be flexible for the development and posting of new trainings as per
the identified needs. This would allow healthcare workers to receive training relevant to their
needs and increase their chances of participation given their busy schedules and care
responsibilities at home. The establishment of the training platform would also require the
development of proper regulation and cooperation with the medical university to take the lead.
Another factor that could amplify trainings’ attractiveness and uptake is the possibility of
accumulating credits for participation for professional accreditation and integration of the
training in the university curriculum on healthcare in emergencies and in post-graduate
courses.

4 .0. Conclusions, lessons and recommendations
This chapter presents key conclusions and recommendations from evaluating selected examples
of UNICEF’s response in the ECD sector to the COVID-19 pandemic. First, it summarizes the main
conclusions resulting from the assessment of UNICEF interventions through the prism of key
evaluation questions, with a special focus on building the capacity of frontline workers. Then, it
presents the main lessons learned from this evaluation and, subsequently, the forward-looking
recommendations for future ECD strategies and/or for similar emergencies.
4.1. Conclusions
A comprehensive approach in terms of targeted groups, content, and components of
interventions was one of the primary strengths of UNICEF’s response to COVID-19. The key
components included a combination of capacity-building of a range of stakeholders (e.g.,
preschool managers, didactic and non-didactic staff, local public authorities, parents,
healthcare workers) and WASH interventions (for pregnant women, newborns, nurses, medical
workers, school facilities, vulnerable families). Such an approach helped address the learning
and hygiene-related needs of many actors involved in delivering services, increased their
knowledge and skills, and established healthy hygiene attitudes and parental behaviors. It also
triggered a sense of responsibility and accountability of all stakeholders for ensuring safety in
health and education facilities, thus diminishing high health, safety, and well-being-related risks
for children, families, and staff.
Investments in the knowledge of frontline workers in many important areas are applicable
beyond the emergency context. They contributed to the ECD services’ resilience and long-term
effectiveness beyond the emergency context by integrating subjects related to preschool
regulations and standards, teaching methodologies, communication with children and parents,
information on other relevant support services for children. In addition, the format and training
organization and delivery can serve as a model of a well-coordinated, prompt, comprehensive,
and efficient response to various emergencies.
Experiences from operating in adverse conditions show areas where gaps exist in frontline
workers’ preparation and support to deliver services more effectively. First, the pandemic has
shown that investment in digital technologies and related skills by frontline workers is critical for
the resilience of ECD interventions. However, training frontline workers in digital competences and
providing them with access to modern ICT tools emerged as a considerably underdeveloped part
of the professional development system. Second, the significance of mentoring and supervision,
information and guidance to provide the proper support and adapt to pandemic conditions, have
been elevated by the pandemic circumstances, along with the need for more opportunities for
networking and exchange of knowledge and experiences with peers and/or other professionals.
Nevertheless, the lack of sustainable mechanisms to provide continuous supervision, support,
and develop and maintain exchange networks create an obstacle for ensuring the quality of
services and building learning communities of professionals.

With this in mind, the online and cascade format of the trainings, accompanied by guiding
m aterials, is a vital first step that ensures frontline workers’ access to learning and skills
development during a health emergency. The flexibility and cost-effectiveness of this form of
delivery made capacity-building programs more accessible to the frontline workers from
different geographical areas, allowed the transfer of knowledge and skills to both non-
participants and families, and thus affected the behavior of many frontline workers in their
daily activities. At the same time, both trainers and parents faced challenges adapting to the
new forms of collaboration in a digital environment. Some frontline workers found it difficult to
stay engaged and motivated during online training and to gain more practical skills without
simulations. As for parents, in some cases, the online mode of sessions, particularly on psycho-
emotional problems and disabilities, was reported to have negatively affected parental
engagement.
The integration of lessons learned from adaptations to the COVID-19 context into newly
developed standards and policies contributes to the sustainability of their results and more
resilient policy-making in the ECD sector. In the case of the healthcare sector, the intervention
and recommendations have been integrated into Standards for antenatal care in ambulatory
conditions as well as in the development of National Clinical Protocols on COVID-19. There are
plans to apply lessons learned for future partnerships in humanitarian situations and COVID-19
pandemic emergency response in Moldova. The sustainability of the intervention’s results in
education is likely to be supported by implementing the Education Strategic Plan 2021-2030 and
the Plan of Action for 2021-2025. Both documents are being developed by the MECR in response
to the pandemic, with the support of UNICEF and the Global Partnership for Education. Setting out
a long-term vision for developing Moldova’s education sector at all levels, the strategy builds on
the lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic and aims to strengthen the system’s
resilience. As such, the strategy foresees the continuation of activities to strengthen the
capacities of learners, teachers, parents, and other relevant stakeholders.93
A long-standing culture of partnership with duty bearers was a factor that made it easier for
UNICEF CO in Moldova to cope with the unprecedented context and provide a targeted response
in an agile manner. The collaborative approach of MHSPF, MECR, UNICEF, and other donors to
provide a rapid response to the COVID-19 emergency situation helped achieve a high level of
relevance of UNICEF support. Development and implementation of the joint Moldova COVID-19
Response and Recovery Window under the Moldova 2030 SDGs Multi-Partner Trust Fund helped
to address the most urgent needs collectively in healthcare and education by considering the
challenging environment. Such a collective approach is a solid base for reducing Moldova’s
vulnerability to the pandemic and enabling efficient recovery of the country.
4.2. Main lessons learned
Lesson learned # 1
Mechanisms that facilitate peer learning and stock-taking activities are essential for
strengthening the CO/ECD staff’s and service provision resilience. They encourage collection
and appliance of the best available knowledge and thinking beyond a “one-time intervention”
93 UN Coordinated Education Task Force for COVID-19 in Moldova (2020). “Education and COVID-19 in Moldova: Grasping the
opportunity the learning crisis presents to build a more resilient education system”.

approach. Thus, finding time for reflection meetings/debriefings between CO’s staff (and also
E CD staff), although challenging during the emergency, is important to determine what works for
whom in which contexts for achieving more significant impact at scale and
reconfiguring/redesigning programmes, strategies, and services accordingly.
Lesson learned # 2
Needs assessment is an essential step for relevant and efficient learning by ECD stakeholders
and frontline workers and for a flexible ECD response in emergency context and beyond.
Collecting data to identify training needs helps design training programs and other activities that
cover critical topics, tailored to various groups of participants and integrated into the pandemic
context. The evaluation process and post-training surveys revealed that some needs have
changed or became more evident as the emergency situation evolved. Thus, a recurring
approach to needs assessment is necessary to catch and address such developments.
Lesson learned # 3
Reaching out to and maintaining regular support and contact with disadvantaged families is
essential during global health emergency and beyond. Evidence shows that the impacts of the
crisis caused by the global health emergency were not evenly distributed and affected
vulnerable children and caregivers the most. Ongoing communication with organizations that
have deep knowledge of local context and the needs of such groups is key to developing targeted
and relevant actions. Specific areas to start with, as emphasized by the current crisis, include:
reducing to a minimum the use of parenting practices that are not conducive to young children’s
cognitive and emotional development and preventing violence against children and gender-
based violence in general.
4.3. Recommendations
The following system-level recommendations were developed and prioritized together with the
UNICEF ECARO and UNICEF Country Office in Moldova, which requested them to address UNICEF
specifically. More detailed and intervention-specific recommendations composed after each
data collection cycle that were discussed and prioritized during workshops can be found in
Analytical Briefs (attached in Annexes A1.1, A1.2, A1.3 in the Country Report Vol.2).
In line with the summary of evaluation findings, the following actions are recommended for
UNICEF:
I. Support national and local efforts towards the sustainable continuous professional
development of frontline workers
Suggestions to operationalize this recommendation include:
• Explore the options to adjust the existing in-service curricula for health workers and educators
to include the most appreciated and needed modules in partnership with medical and
pedagogical universities (legislative provisions, accumulation of credits, integration of the
training in the university curriculum on health care in emergencies).
o Define the criteria and requirements to embed the COVID-19 response-driven interventions
into broader policies and programs (e.g., financial and non-financial resources).
o Summarize the key requirements in terms of an enabling environment and staff capacity

Suggestions to operationalize this recommendation include:
• Advocate for provisions, including legislation and funding arrangements, ensuring that
kindergartens and health care facilities have access to ICT equipment.
o Advocate for a comprehensive material assessment of preschool and healthcare facilities
to take stock of and establish the need for: a.) ICT equipment that can be used to deliver
online capacity building sessions to preschool staff and caregivers, and b.) accessible
infrastructure and assistive equipment that can be used to provide early education to
children with special educational needs.
o Use the momentum to advocate for improving frontline workers' access to modern
technologies and equipment and providing better technical assistance, such as IT support.
• Support the development of training programs designed to fortify frontline workers' digital skills
and inclusion of these trainings into regular capacity-building activities and professional
development programs.
• Support development of disability-sensitive training content on providing online support to
education to increase frontline workers' understanding of specific needs of children with
disabilities and their families during and beyond the emergency period.
III. Strengthen capacities of LPA representatives and managers from health and education
services to enhance the use of local resources and increase efficiency Continue to support
capacity-building activities that empower caregivers and reflect the needs of vulnerable
families and staff working with them
Suggestions to operationalize this recommendation include:
• Provide technical support and advocate for developing a teacher-training program aimed at
continuous improvement of preschool didactical and support staff's capacity to deliver
inclusive early childhood education, including children with disabilities and developmental
delays and other vulnerable children.
• Support and advocate for approval of the new cross-sectoral Strategy on Positive parenting
(as this one expires in 2022) along with the Action Plan and support the implementation of the
regular positive parenting training for both preschool workers and caregivers to support the
implementation of the positive parenting approach.
• Support information and coaching provision tailored to the frontline workers' needs for
improved communication skills, building collaborative partnerships with parents, better
responding to caregivers' queries, and reaching the most vulnerable groups.
