1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.1 Introduction
This report presents the results of the formative and summative evaluation of the Accelerating
Sanitation and Water for All programme in Sierra Leone (ASWA-SL). The evaluation was carried out by
PEM consult in 2020. The evaluation reviewed programme implementation and results from January
2013 to December 2019, after program closure. ASWA-SL was funded by the Directorate-General for
International Cooperation (DGIS) of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands and was
implemented by United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Sierra Leone, the Government of Sierra
Leone (GoSL) and partners. ASWA-SL was implemented in three target districts, Bonthe, Koinadugu
and Falaba, covering 15 chiefdoms. The program was funded with contributions from UNICEF Sierra
Leone, GoSL and the recipient communities of the programme with a total budget of USD 10.8 million.
The programme was temporarily suspended in 2015 during the Ebola outbreak, and funds during the
outbreak were re-programmed for Ebola response, with a separate Ebola response grant from DGIS.
1.2 The ASWA-SL Programme
DGIS and UNICEF initiated the Accelerated Sanitation and Water for All in West and Central Africa
(ASWA-WCA) in December 2012. ASWA-WCA was a multi-country WASH programme implemented in
nine West African countries, including Sierra Leone, which were off-track vis-à-vis achieving their
Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 7c targets.
In Sierra Leone, ASWA-SL emanated from GoSL’s participation in the Sanitation and Water for All (SWA)
global partnership, as a means to increasing political prioritization, promoting evidence-based decision
making, and increasing allocation of resources in the water and sanitation sectors. The programme
supported the development and implementation of national plans of action, which resulted from the
SWA initiative. The SWA process helped to drive these advances forward and contributed to the
specific government commitment to prioritise the delivery of sanitation and water for the country’s
development agenda. This is specifically articulated in the Agenda for Prosperity (PRSP III - 2012) and
the National Water and Sanitation Policy (NWSP 2010).
The goal of the ASWA-SL programme is to achieve improved child health, survival rates and well-being
and contribute to a reduction of diarrhoea incidence among children under the age of five by
accelerating the achievement of MDG 7c through four major areas of focus: i) Accelerating sanitation
and water coverage to meet MDG targets, ii) Strengthening national sector development, iii)
Institutional strengthening and capacity building to enhance WASH sector service delivery, and iv)
Ensuring the sustainability of systems and behaviours.
1.3 Purpose and objectives of the evaluation
This evaluation has two purposes related to accountability and organizational learning: First, in terms
of accountability, to allow for reporting on the results achieved by the ASWA-SL programme vis-à-vis
the donor (DGIS) but also accountability towards the populations targeted by the programme. Second,
in terms of organizational learning, to document good practices and lessons learned from the
implementation of the programmes to inform decision-making on scaling up the different approaches
adopted during implementation and to formulate new strategies. According to the evaluation terms
of reference (ToR), the specific uses of the evaluation are to:
− Document best practices and lessons learned to inform future programming.
− To support national authorities by using lessons.
− Adjust district lead monitoring approaches to enhance quality programme delivery and
development of district lead sustainability plans.
1
− Influence and inform future allocation of resources in the area of WASH.
− Support partner Non-Governmental Organisations and Civil society organization to strengthen
capacity where it is lacking.
The evaluation also assesses the extent of coverage of the programme interventions in relation to
WASH programme related needs in both terms of geographic coverage, numbers of children and
women supported against actual numbers of women and children in need. The evaluation assesses
the quality of the services provided in relation to relevant national and international standards and
looks at the effectiveness of programme partnerships and coordination, particularly between UNICEF
and implementing partners at national, district and local levels.
1.4 Scope of the evaluation
The evaluation focusses entirely on system-wide performance in the thematic area of WASH, and the
sustained contribution to development results under this theme in the defined time period through
ASWA-SL. Geographically, the evaluation focuses on the integrated WASH package delivered by
UNICEF and implementation partners in the targeted communities of the following three districts:
Bonthe, Koinadugu, and Falaba. The evaluation covers all the Programme’s interventions
implemented between 2012 and 2019.

1.5 Evaluation criteria and evaluation questions
In order to fulfil its purposes and objectives, the evaluation assessed the programme against the 5
OECD criteria of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability, and impact; with the additional
criterion of gender, equity, and human rights. The evaluation covered 27 evaluation questions, see
Chapter 7 for an overview and Error! Reference source not found. for detailed information.

1.6 Methodology
The evaluation was a summative evaluation assessing whether ASWA-SL achieved its intended goals,
objectives, outcomes, and impact. The evaluation was also formative by drawing out lessons learned
for future programming of WASH implementation. The evaluation was based on mixed-method
approach for data collection and analysis with a strong utilization focus. Qualitative and quantitative
data was collected from end beneficiaries, key stakeholders, and implementing partners. The data
collection included qualitative data from key informant interviews with sector stakeholders and focus
group discussions with community level stakeholders, and quantitative data from observations of
WASH facilities and an end-line survey.
1.7. Findings and conclusions (by criterion)
The findings are presented in Chapter 9 in relation to each one of the evaluation questions. The
conclusions in correspondence of the different evaluation criteria are detailed in Chapter 11.
Relevance
ASWA-SL is an exemplar of integrated rural WASH programming that fitted clearly within Sierra Leone’s
national policy framework and goals, as well as within UNICEF’s global approach to WASH. While
ASWA-SL reached specific groups including women, girls and boys, and people living with disabilities,
more attention could have been paid to the specific strategies required to reach vulnerable groups.
The intervention strategy’s link to outcomes and impact was weak and programme assumptions were
not clearly identified. In some cases, there was not sufficient clarity on the indicator definitions for
measuring achievements and different wordings were used in programme document and progress
reports.
Effectiveness
ASWA-SL achieved good results in a challenging environment. Broadly, the targets were reported to
be reached or even exceeded; however, limited clarity on the indicator definitions and findings from
the field indicate that the achievements could be less than reported. ASWA-SL was successful in raising
awareness on hygiene and reducing open defecation in the communities, as well as improving WASH
facilities and hygiene in schools. However, the evaluation findings indicate that the quality of the water
facilities was uneven, with some facilities not functioning or being seasonal. The extent to which
ASWA-SL contributed to creating enabling environment for the WASH sector in Sierra Leone is not
easily measurable. ASWA-SL made a tangible contribution to improving monitoring and district level
coordination of the rural WASH sector in Sierra Leone.
Efficiency
Overall, ASWA-SL was implemented efficiently with the reported unit costs in line with WASH costs
normally found in Sierra Leone; although this cannot be firmly established by the evaluation team due
to the limited information available and the inconsistencies in the interpretation of indicators for
calculating beneficiaries’ access to WASH services as a result of the ASWA-SL interventions. The
resources available for the ASWA-SL implementation were generally adequate, although some
interventions were not optimally costed, which led to implementation challenges such as delays in
completing facilities. The quality of the facilities construction was generally fair to good, but there were
some areas of weakness related to siting of hand-dug wells and design of piped systems. Implementers
broadly expressed satisfaction with the support provided by the UNICEF staff to facilitate
implementation. However, in some cases UNICEF procurement procedures and disbursement
requirements caused some implementation delays.
Sustainability
Overall, ASWA-SL had some success in terms of achieving sustainability, as communities are generally
willing to pay for WASH services and pay either on a monthly basis or when there is a need for repairs.
3
There is evidence that hand pumps are maintained in some communities, although difficulties in
accessing skilled mechanics and spare-parts exists. The ability to pay at the community and school level
for O&M remains insufficient, as well as the ability to pay for replicating toilets. The sustainability at
the community level in terms of behavioural change and maintaining ‘Open Defecation Free’ (ODF)
status continues to be a challenge in some communities. The approaches around the sustainability
framework were commendable and appropriate, but there is only limited support from district
authorities to the communities to continue WASH activities and limited resources for the Districts to
carry out the WASH monitoring and support activities.
Gender, Equity and Human Rights
ASWA-SL was successful in ensuring equal participation and representation of women and men in
WASH decision-making and management. However, ASWA-SL was not equally successful in ensuring
participation of vulnerable groups, such as persons living with disabilities, poorer households, and
children. Positive responses were made on the achievements on safety for women and children to
access the WASH facilities. The integration of education and child protection strategies with WASH
programming was informal at the strategic level, but local implementing partners used their own
expertise to contribute to child protection strategies, including awareness raising on sexual
exploitation. The sanitation facilities implemented in schools were appropriate and according to the
national standards with separate toilets for boys and girls and appropriate facilities for disabled access
and menstrual hygiene. Positive results were achieved in terms of reducing the work-load for
collection of water, women’s control of finances through the ‘Village Saving and Loan Associations
(VSLAs), female representation and participation in decision-making, as well as the perception of the
roles of girls and boys. ASWA-SL succeeded in reducing community-level equity gaps in terms of
women’s and other vulnerable groups’ access to WASH services. However, equity gaps in terms of
rural/ urban access at national level are generally widening. UNICEF and ASWA-SL were found to have
had a positive impact on the inclusion of gender equity, child protection and the participation of
vulnerable groups in the national sector guidelines and policy documents.
Impact
Although it is not possible clearly to attribute improvements or changes in health conditions to ASWA-
SL, the stakeholders generally agree that health conditions and living standards were affected
positively by ASWA-SL. The stakeholders also find that school absenteeism has reduced due to better
access to WASH facilities. ASWA-SL was found to have contributed to improving national WASH
governance vis-à-vis WASH M&E and the National Strategy on Sanitation and Hygiene, and sanitation
and coordination at district level. However, ASWA-SL was not able to influence funding allocations
significantly as the GoSL funding for WASH from internal sources remains low.
ASWA strengths and weaknesses
Strengths: ASWA-SL made a significant direct contribution to improving the access to WASH services
in the districts covered, and indirectly broadly in rural Sierra Leone through its contribution to
improving national capacities, supporting the achievement of GoSL’s objectives and SDG targets of
improving WASH coverage and reducing the equity gap. Despite the challenging environment with
poor accessibility and disruption by an Ebola outbreak, ASWA-SL appears to have been able to reach
or even exceed its targets, although there is uncertainty about the number of people actually reached.
Several of the communities covered reached ODF status. The WASH infrastructure installed was mostly
appropriate, of adequate quality, and at reasonable costs. UNICEF provided good technical support to
the IPs, but cumbersome procurement procedures and late disbursements created delays.
Beneficiaries were reached through WASH infrastructure, hygiene awareness raising, and access to
micro-finance. Through its integrated approach, ASWA-SL reached and addressed the WASH needs of
different population segments, including women, girls, boys, and people living disabilities, and reduced
4
the workload and improved the safety of women and children. ASWA-SL was also successful in
ensuring the participation of women in WASH decision-making. ASWA-SL also ensured a sense of
ownership of the WASH facilities, with communities generally being willing to pay for O&M.
ASWA-SL made a moderate contribution to policy improvements (e.g. vis-à-vis inclusion and child
protection in the National Strategy on Sanitation and Hygiene), and a more substantial contribution to
improved WASH sector monitoring and district level coordination.
Weaknesses: The programme strategy did not contain a sufficiently strong results chain linking
activities and outputs to outcomes and impact, and the underlying assumptions for achieving the
intended results were not properly identified. A major weakness was the definition of indicators and
the monitoring of progress, which did not obtain sufficiently detailed or clear data on the beneficiaries
reached and achievement of targets, despite ASWA-SL’s support for WASH sector monitoring. Some
of the infrastructure visited by the evaluation team had design or construction weaknesses, and do
not function satisfactorily or not at all. The approach to reach and address the particular needs of
vulnerable groups was not sufficiently comprehensive. Women, children, and people living with
disabilities were reached, but ASWA-SL was less successful in ensuring the representation of e.g.
people living with disabilities in WASH decision-making. Overall, the ASWA-SL contribution to creating
enabling environment for the WASH sector in Sierra Leone was appreciated by stakeholders but found
to be modest and difficult to document.
1.8 Lessons learned
1. It is important to understand behavioural changes to ensure that the participatory and inclusive
approaches lead to programme sustainability. Without incremental changes in behavioural
change being monitored and analysed with intent, it can be difficult to plan evidence based
sustainability strategies.
2. The insights of communities are essential for understanding the needs and barriers of the most
vulnerable and how they can be reached, and therefore important to tap into systematically and
integrate in program monitoring.
3. Access to information and data is essential for effective and evidence-based decision-making and
coordination – a lack of complete, systematic, and Gender, Equity and Human Rights (GEHR)
sensitive monitoring and record keeping of activities and completed facilities can thus be a major
impediment for results-oriented program management.
4. It is difficult to ensure functional and sustainable water systems, without sufficient attention to
quality of survey and design activities.
5. Achieving sustained benefits in terms of improved health and living standards require combined
access to water and sanitation and good hygiene practices/ behavioural changes.
1.9 Recommendations
Drawing on the findings and conclusions generated in the course of the evaluation, the evaluation
team developed a series of strategic and operational recommendations. The recommendations were
developed in a participatory manner with UNICEF and other in-country partners. Key evaluation users
had several opportunities – once the draft report was submitted for review – to discuss with the
evaluation team on how to make the recommendations relevant, actionable, precise and suitable to
the specific context.

2 IMPLEMENTATION CONTEXT
2.1 Introduction
Sierra Leone, a West African country of 7.5 million people, ranks 202nd of 211 in per capita gross domestic
product1 (GDP). High dependence on agriculture and natural resources, coupled with high rates of
poverty, unemployment, and environmental degradation, has caused a high level of vulnerability
throughout the country.
The WASH sector has contended with enormous risks and challenges in recent years. A decade of civil war
befell Sierra Leone in the 1990s and up until 2002, devastating water and sanitation infrastructure, and
all progress in the sector. In December 2013 – very shortly after initiation of ASWA-SL – an Ebola virus
epidemic affected Sierra Leone, lasting 2½ years. According to the WHO, the outbreak of Ebola virus
disease in West Africa was the “largest, most severe and most complex Ebola epidemic” in history. More
than 28,000 people were infected, and over 11,000 people died before the international public health
emergency ended in June 2016. Most of the cases occurred in three countries: Sierra Leone, Guinea, and
Liberia. In Sierra Leone, Ebola claimed more than 3,500 lives including those of 200 healthcare workers.
The impact on the economy was catastrophic, the healthcare system nearly collapsed, and schools closed
for almost a year. To put the country’s economy back on track, the government’s National Ebola Response
Strategy identifies recovery priorities in key sectors, including WASH.
Sierra Leone faces multiple risks from climate change that threaten key economic sectors, increasing the
potential for wider environmental degradation. Climate impact projections in Sierra Leone include
increases in temperature, more extreme weather including more intense precipitation, in turn increasing
the risk of land/ mudslides where there is deforestation and erosion as well as rising sea levels. Flooding
affects urban and rural parts of Sierra Leone on a recurrent basis. Climate change further aggravates the
risk of water-borne diseases (i.e. typhoid dysentery cholera and diarrhoea) where there is already a lack
of safe drinking water and sanitation services.
A high degree of gender disparity exists in Sierra Leone. For instance, the proportion of women aged 20-
24 years old who were married or in union before age 18 is 29.9%.2 The adolescent birth rate remains high
at 101.3 per 1,000 persons as of 2016, although down from 139.4 per 1,000 persons in 2013-2015. In
Sierra Leone, data is only available for 33.6% of the indicators needed for monitoring the SDGs from a
gender perspective.3 However, the 2019 Sierra Leone Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) reported that
28% of the households were female-headed and 43% of females were literate.
Human rights in Sierra Leone are gradually improving following the civil war which ended in 2002, and the
democratic transition is steadily evolving. In 2019, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner
for Human Rights (OHCHR) reported outstanding requests from the Special Rapporteurs on health; on
rights to water and sanitation; and on freedom of expression.

The trend in under-five mortality is illustrated in Figure 2-1. The 2019 rate was 110 per 1,000 births, down
from 260 in 1990. There has therefore been a significant steady drop in under-five mortality in the country
as a whole. This may be a result of a number of government and development partners’ interventions,
including free healthcare services for mothers and children, insecticide treated mosquito nets, and
improved access to WASH services over the years.

2.2 WASH Sector in Sierra Leone
The 2012 World Health Organization (WHO)/ UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) on rural WASH
access, demonstrated very low levels of coverage of safe drinking water in Sierra Leone: 36% had access
to a basic level of service5, while 53% of the rural population were accessing water from unimproved or
surface water sources. In 2012, data compiled by the JMP indicated that the rate of progress towards
achieving the MDG water and sanitation targets in Sierra Leone would not be reached by 2015. The 2010
Sierra Leone National Water and Sanitation Policy (NWSP)6 set national targets for sanitation and water
supply access at 66% and 74% respectively, applicable equally to both rural and urban areas.
The most recent JMP has demonstrated that Sierra Leone is indicated as one of the 20 countries that has
increased the proportion of the population using at least a basic drinking water service (by 21%) between
2000-2017.7 Despite this, challenges exist: one in four households spend over 30 minutes a day collecting

11
water, and in three out of four, the burden falls on women and girls.8 Only 19% of the population had a
basic handwashing facility at home, and 26% of the rural population practices open defection.9
Gender-based inequalities exist in access to rural water supply in Sierra Leone. UNICEF and WHO’s Special
Report on WASH Inequalities (2000-2017) reported that more than one in four households spend over 30
minutes per day collecting water and three out of five households rely on women, while one in seven rely
on girls to do this work. The average collection time for women and girls is approximately 25 minutes per
household per day, which equates to over 175 million hours annually on a national level.
Urban and rural disparities also exist in Sierra Leone. In 2012, around 40% of the population rural areas
were reported to have access to safe water, compared to around 80% in urban areas. On sanitation, the
2012 JMP found that progress was seriously off-track. At the time, sanitation coverage in Sierra Leone
needed to increase from 6% to 53% in rural areas to meet the MDG target in 2015.
In Sierra Leone, low access to WASH services significantly contributes to diarrhoea, acute respiratory
infections (ARIs), under-nutrition and worm infestations. It contributes to infections in healthcare settings
that can lead to increased under-five morbidity and mortality and increased risk of maternal and new-
born mortality. It can lead to both boys and girls missing school due to sickness or the time taken to collect
water for the family and reduced cognitive attention due to worm infestations and dehydration. It can
also pose additional challenges for girls due to concern over the use of toilets and how they manage their
menstrual hygiene.
According to Sierra Leone StatWASH 2010 data (survey data of 4,212 primary schools in 13 districts), only
22.9% of primary schools had access to functional safe drinking water and one quarter had access to
functional sanitation facilities in the school premises. Monitoring often observed open defecation by
children around or even in the school compound.

2.2.1 Institutional and Policy Context
Sierra Leone’s Agenda for Prosperity (2013-2017)11 built on the Agenda for Change (2008-2012), the
implementation of which had made good progress in reducing poverty and working towards the MDGs.
In the Agenda for Prosperity there were five focus areas, one of which was water and sanitation. The
President of Sierra Leone also committed to the Sanitation and Water for All (SWA) with six sector
deliverables, including development of WASH investment plans, institutional capacity building and budget
allocation to WASH. These commitments were aligned with the country’s Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP III 2013-2018) which articulated higher levels of technology in rural areas through promoting
power pumped systems and pipe borne water, as opposed to hand-pumped point water sources.
Sierra Leone’s National Water and Sanitation Policy (NWSP) (2010) responded to the urgent need for
integrated and cross-sectoral approaches to water management and development as well as the provision
of safe and adequate water and adequate sanitation facilities. To achieve sanitation scale-up in rural
areas, the Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) was adopted by the Government of Sierra Leone and
coordinated by the Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MoHS) and UNICEF.
ASWA-SL was designed to align with the NWSP (2010) in relation to water supply and sanitation, the
National Decentralization of Services Policy (2004), and the PRSP III in relation to the operation and
maintenance of water supply and sanitation facilities which encouraged greater involvement of NGOs and
the private sector (promotion of National Content directive), and the utilisation of community-based
approaches as per SWA commitments made by the GoSL. The four key ministries signed an Memorandum
of Understanding to deliver commitments to SWA made by the GoSL.
Looking forward, the Medium-term National Development Plan (MTNDP) 2019–2023 is the overall
planning document for Sierra Leone to move forward and monitor progress towards achieving the SDGs.

Institutional changes during ASWA Implementation
The programme under evaluation was incepted when the new Ministry of Water Resources (MWR) was
established with the mandate to oversee the management and coordination of water resources, and thus
implemented during a period of considerable institutional development in the water sector.
The mandates for sanitation and hygiene remain in the purview of the Ministry of Health and Sanitation
and the now Ministry of Basic and Senior Secondary Education (MBSSE) is responsible for school WASH,
while the decentralisation of service provision to the districts was developing during the programme
implementation period.
Figure 2-3: Institutional roles and relationships in the water supply and sanitation sector (2011)12
The intended reforms of the legal framework as outlined in the NWSP (2010) had largely been achieved
by the end of 2019. This included the introduction of regulation of service provision through the
establishment of the Electricity and Water Regulatory Commission (EWRC, 2015); the introduction of
regulation of water resources through the National Water Resources Management Agency (NWRMA,
2019); and amendments to the mandates of the major water utilities Guma Valley Water Company
(GVWC) and Sierra Leone Water Company (SALWACO).
A comprehensive implementation programme, the National Rural Water Supply and Sanitation
Programme (NRWSSP, 2016) was developed for the rural WASH sub-sector to achieve the SDGs. The
NRWSSP prescribes comprehensive capacity development for district and national level sector
coordination for rural WASH.

2.2.2 Analysis of Rural WASH Sector Priorities in Sierra Leone
Specific Bottlenecks in the WASH Sector 13
A WASH Bottleneck Analysis workshop using the Bottleneck Assessment Tool (BAT) was carried out in
March 2013 in close coordination with MWR, MoHS, Ministry of Education and Ministry of Local
Government, with participation of other sector stakeholders in Sierra Leone. The key purpose of the
workshop was to use the tool to stimulate reflection on the major bottlenecks to WASH sector progress
in Sierra Leone. The key identified bottlenecks included the following:
− Supply chain and services (national, district and community levels): Sustainability of water points,
e.g. hand pumps, motorized pumps, and hand dug wells, is a critical concern as spare parts for
pumps are not available at the district, chiefdom, and community levels.
− Budgeting and accounting structure (national and sub-national levels): Funds from local
government finance to the line ministries at the district level are irregular or often delayed in
transfer.
− Legal framework and institutional reforms: A sector-wide review of legal instruments is
necessary to support institutional reforms. Human resource capacity development is required as
well as institutional strengthening at district level to implement national policy.
− WASH Sector Financing: The African Ministers Council on Water (AMCOW) Country Status
Overviews were developed in 2009-10. The AMCOW RWS CSO2 scorecard indicates several
concerns along the service delivery pathway. The poorest scores were registered for planning,
budgeting, delivering outputs, and ensuring adequate maintenance of services.
The BAT report highlights an annual investment of USD164 million is needed for new urban and rural
water supply facilities, and rehabilitation of existing facilities. Compared with anticipated public financing,
the projected minimum deficit totals over USD130 million per year for the water supply subsectors. For
sanitation, the annual capital investment requirement is USD40 million.
13 As outlined in the following publications: WB, WSP, AMCOW Country Status Overview: Water Supply and Sanitation in Sierra
Leone, Turning Finance into Services for 2015 and Beyond’, 2011; MWR and MoHS, ‘Sierra Leone Water and Sanitation Sector
Performance Report, 2012, 2013; National Workshop on the WASH Bottleneck Analysis – 2013;
15
Figure 2-4: Annual overall and per capita investment requirements and financing by source14
The report further recommends a set of actions for rural water supply: to increase subsector funding,
through public (including donor) and user contributions whilst rapidly improving the current absorptive
capacities; to rapidly implement the practice of community ownership and management; to actively build
the capacity of the private sector to enable it to provide goods and services and to develop appropriate
strategies and guidelines to support the implementation of interventions. In Sierra Leone, as in many
countries, there is an implicit assumption that operation and maintenance (O&M) costs will be recovered
from users. In reality, this is not achieved, as evidenced in the low functionality rate for community
managed rural water facilities. For rural sanitation and hygiene, the report recommends increasing the
budget for sanitation, in particular for strengthening institutions and undertaking community sensitization
programs; to complement CLTS with microfinancing to assure uptake and to undertake continuous
monitoring of uptake.
Key actors and similar programmes in 2012-2019
UNICEF’s WASH Programme was recognized as a major rural WASH intervention in Sierra Leone. In 2008
the programme targeted six rural districts: Bombali, Kenema, Moyamba, Port Loko, Pujehun and Tonkolili
Districts with support from the UK Department for International Development (DfID) and Netherlands
National Committee for UNICEF. It had five pillar strategies for environmental sanitation, communication
for development, community water supply, WASH in clinics, and WASH in schools. It aimed to achieve
100% open defecation free (ODF) and 100% coverage of primary schools and clinics in the six target
districts to ensure sustainability of behavioural change in sanitation and hygiene among the target
populations and institutional improvement in WASH sector.
The African Development Bank (AfDB) in 2013 appraised a “Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Programme
(RWSSP)” providing an estimated 625,000 people (47% women) with access to safe water, including
restoring access for 361,000, with a budget of USD43.3 million.

Figure 2-5: Rural WASH Funding 2013 - 2018 15
As illustrated on Figure 2-5, the annual
funding for Rural WASH was in the
range of 30 to 45m USD annually in
2013-18.
DfID supported institutional
development and capacity building of
the new MWR from 2010 onwards,
including funding for the WASH Facility
for the implementation of numerous
studies and capacity development
assignments. The support also included
institutional strengthening and
capacity development in Ministry of
Health and Sanitation (MoHS) for
sanitation.
The World Bank’s (WB) Water and Sanitation Programme (WSP) only engaged in Sierra Leone in 2012 as
part of their growing engagement in fragile states, supporting the first water point mapping16. One water
project includes approximately 200 boreholes drilled by a Korean company and some shallow wells and
sanitation with subsidy.
Other rural water and sanitation actors include JICA, the European Union (EU) and the Swedish
international Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA). NGOs also played a crucial role in service delivery
and capacity building. The WASH Consortium (an NGO consortium led by Oxfam) carried out a three-year
project from January 2010 to March 2013 in vulnerable areas of Freetown with a budget of £4 million with
support from DfID.

3.2 Overview of ASWA-SL
Accelerated Sanitation and Water for All in West and Central Africa (ASWA-WCA) was implemented in
nine West African countries that were off track on achieving their MDG 7 targets. DGIS and UNICEF, as
part of their commitment to support MDG 7 and subsequently SDG 6, initiated ASWA in Sierra Leone
(ASWA-SL) in January 2013. A follow-up, the ASWA II was initiated in 2020 and is currently under
implementation.
ASWA-SL was developed in a bid to support the country in achieving the WASH-related targets of the
MDGs and the then active Government Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper III (PRSP III). The overall goal of
the programme was to achieve improved child health, survival rates and well-being and contribute to a
reduction of diarrhoea incidence among children under the age of five by accelerating the achievement
of MDG 7. The objective of the programme, as identified in the programme proposal: By 2017, contribute
to reduce under five mortality rate attributed to diarrhoea by 10% and to reduced absenteeism in target
district schools.
ASWA implemented and upscaled WASH coverage in target districts, while also building government
capacity and systems in rural water, contributing to the national development plan.
Figure 3-1: Map of Sierra Leone, project locations shaded in green17
ASWA-SL was an integrated rural
WASH programme designed to
increase sustainable and equitable
access to water and sanitation,
improve hygiene practices, and
contribute to sector capacity
development in support of MDG 7
(now SDG 6) targets and national
development goals, partly through
mainstreaming gender into
programme design. The programme
included a mix of support at national,
sub-national and local levels. It applied
community participatory approaches
and strengthened community capacity
to manage their water supply and
sanitation facilities. Institutional
WASH was integral to the programme,
with a focus on WASH in schools. ASWA-SL had five main programme outcome areas: water supply,
sanitation, WASH in institutions (schools), hygiene education, and enabling environment.
17 Source: ASWA-SL Proposal, 2012
19
ASWA-SL ran in target communities in the three districts of Bonthe, Koinadugu, and Falaba. Originally, the
programme targeted two districts, but Koinadugu was subsequently split into Koinadugu and Falaba.18.
The purpose of ASWA-SL (as with ASWA-WCA more broadly) was to accelerate water and sanitation
coverage through four major areas of focus:
- Accelerating sanitation and water coverage to meet MDG targets;
- Strengthening national sector development;
- Institutional strengthening and capacity building to enhance WASH sector service delivery; and
- Ensuring the sustainability of systems and behaviours.
ASWA-SL utilized participatory methodologies under the CLTS approach, which is part of the UNICEF Sierra
Leone community-based services delivery model. The WASH in School Programme had a strategic role in
implementing a nationwide coverage of School Sanitation and Hygiene Education (SSHE) in all of the
country’s 5,000 schools and thereby contributed to Sierra Leone’s education goals.
The expected outcomes of ASWA-SL were to sustain good water, sanitation, and hygiene behavioural
change of the population and to institutionalize sector coordination for effective and efficient
implementation of WASH programmes. The project was also designed to improve WASH conditions in
targeted schools and thereby influence decreased absenteeism rates, especially among girls.
The expected impact, results, outcomes, and outputs are presented in Figure 3-2.

Theory of Change for ASWA-SL
The theory of change for ASWA-SL is presented in Figure 3-3 below. It illustrates the predicted health
benefits that would result from the programme interventions on implementation of CLTS, promotion of
handwashing, maintenance of rural water systems and WASH in Schools, having an impact on child
morbidity and mortality.
Figure 3-3: ASWA-SL Theory of Change
Programme implementation arrangements
ASWA-SL focused on maximizing partnerships and leveraging resources from government and other
stakeholders to scale up WASH activities. As part of the GoSL/UNICEF country programme, the programme
21
was implemented by GoSL, working with NGOs, WASH partners and the private sector. As such, the
programme included a mix of support at national, sub-national and local levels.
At the national level, ASWA-SL activities were coordinated by UNICEF with the intent to work through the
coordination mechanisms within the sector, mainly:
− Inter-Ministerial Council on WASH (IMC): The Inter-Ministerial Council on WASH is the apex body
dealing with water resources management and supply, sanitation, and hygiene issues such as
legislative proposals, decisions on institutional reforms and policies. It has representation from all
WASH-related ministries.
− Sector Policy Co-ordination Team (SPCT): This body was established to direct, coordinate, and
manage implementation of the NWSP. It has representation from the Ministry of Energy and
Water Resources (MEWR), Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MoHS), Ministry of Education,
Science and Technology (MEST), Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development (MLGRD)
and Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MoFED), UNICEF, and the NGO Consortium
− Sector Budget Working Group (SBWG): The SBWG ensures that ministry-specific and broad sector
plans are harmonised with the budget cycle and that activities are funded.
At the district level, the main representation comprised the Council, deconcentrated staff of the Water
Supply Division (WSD) in MEWR, the District Health Management Team (DHMT), UNICEF, and NGOs.
Community WASH committees were supported to manage the implementation at community level.
A range of programming models were implemented in the ASWA-SL. Table 3-2 below broadly outlines the
globally recognized WASH models implemented:
Table 3-2: Recognised WASH Approaches implemented in Sierra Leone.
WASH Programming Model Brief synopsis of approach
Household water treatment and • Household water treatment and safe storage is an important public
safe storage (HHWT) – combined health intervention to improve the quality of drinking-water and reduce
with water point rehabilitation and diarrhoeal disease, particularly among those who rely on water from
construction of new water points unimproved sources, and in some cases, unsafe or unreliable piped
water supplies.
Village Level Operation and • VLOM is an unofficial classification given to handpumps used in
Maintenance (VLOM) developing countries that require minimal maintenance or maintenance
that can be done "at the village level."
Community Led Total Sanitation • Community Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) is an innovative methodology for
(CLTS) mobilising communities to completely eliminate open defecation (OD).
Communities are facilitated to conduct their own appraisal and analysis
of open defecation (OD) and take their own action to become ODF (open
defecation free). CLTS focuses on the behavioural change needed to
ensure real and sustainable improvements – investing in community
mobilisation instead of hardware.
WASH in Schools (WinS) • The scaling-up WASH in Schools (WinS) programme implements a range
Approaches of approaches in Sierra Leone: Child friendly WASH facilities, School
Sanitation and Hygiene Education (SSHE) and School Led Total Sanitation
(SLTS). Key project activities include: supporting a basic package of
WASH services in schools and employing participatory learning
22
techniques to allow school children to adopt positive sanitation and
hygiene behaviour change.
• WinS activities are implemented with School Management Committees
(SMCs), comprising of parents and teachers, and influencing community-
wide behaviour change through SLTS which complement or supplement
CLTS in the target areas.
• The Child Friendly Schooling (CFS) concept has been promoted globally,
as an initiative specifically focused on ensuring children’s right to quality
education is realised. It does this by providing a comprehensive multi-
dimensional definition of quality education, encompassing inclusion;
health, safety, protection; teaching and learning; and community
partnership strategies, which collectively reflect the main dimensions
that present barriers to education for children.

The original programme proposal planned for a DGIS contribution of USD 9,974,686, with contributions
from UNICEF, GoSL, and communities. Water point mapping, international staff costs and teacher training
under SSHE were cost shared and had a contribution from DfID funding and in-kind support including
quality assurance and support from UNICEF staff. Table 3-3 presents the overall budget as synthesized
from the original programme proposal.

4 Evaluation Purpose
This evaluation of the ASWA-SL programme was carried out in conjunction with a desk review of the eight
other ASWA programmes funded by DGIS, and a parallel evaluation of the Programme d’Hydraulique et
23
d’Assainissement du Millénaire (PHAM) in Ivory Coast. The results of the desk review and the evaluation
of the Sanitation Programme in Ivory Coast are described in separate reports.
The evaluation of ASWA-SL had two different purposes related to accountability and organizational
learning:
− First, in terms of accountability to allow for reporting on the results achieved by ASWA-SL vis-à-vis
the donor, DGIS, but also accountability towards the populations targeted by the programme.
− Second, in terms of organizational learning to document good practices and lessons learned from the
implementation of the programme to inform decision-making on scaling up the different approaches
adopted during implementation and to formulate new strategies.
Users of the evaluation
According to the ToR, the specific users of the evaluation are outlined in Table 4-1: Users of the evaluation

of sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA).
6 Evaluation Scope
Thematic scope
The evaluation focused on ASWA-SL’s engagement in the thematic area of rural water, sanitation, and
hygiene (WASH). The evaluation did not cover the Ebola response per se but covered some of the
reprogrammed activities that occurred in response to Ebola as part of the overall programme. The
evaluation covered all aspects of development rural WASH (i.e. non-emergency WASH).
25
Geographical scope
The evaluation focused on the whole WASH package
Population Projections
delivered by UNICEF and implementation partners in the Koinadugu (before it was split) had an estimated
targeted communities in the three districts of: Bonthe, total population of 456,140 (226,832 female and
Koinadugu and Falaba. 229,308 male); and number of children under age
five of 52,214 (25,964 female and 26,250 male).
Other estimates based on the census put children
The ToR suggested that an analysis of two comparison
under age one at 18,246, pregnant women at
districts should be done, however this was changed 18,702 and women of childbearing age at 101,263.
during the planning of the data collection as other
organisations besides UNICEF were carrying out WASH The total population of Bonthe is 219,218 (110,164
female and 109,054 male); and number of children
activities in the neighbouring districts. The data collection
under age five at 30,344 (15,243 female and 15,101
was therefore planned with ‘control’ communities in the
male). Other estimates based on the census put
target districts that were not covered by ASWA-SL. children under age one at 8,329, pregnant women
at 8,537, and women of childbearing age at 46,224.
The evaluation takes into consideration the current total
population and population groups of interest to UNICEF in
the three districts. The overall 2019 population in the districts targeted by the programme under
evaluation according to the 2015 National Census population projections are presented in the textbox.
Since ASWA was initiated in 2012 before the 2015 census, lower population estimates would have been
the basis for the initial planning.
Temporal scope
The evaluation covers ASWA-SL from its initiation in 2012 to its completion in December 2019.
7 Criteria and Evaluation Questions
To fulfil its purposes and objectives, the evaluation relied on five (05)OECD/DAC criteria of relevance,
effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability, and impact , and the additional criterion of gender, equity, and
human rights as per UNICEF’s evaluation guidance. The evaluation questions (EQs) are grouped under
these headings, as per ToRs (see Appendix 1: Terms of Reference). In consultation with UNICEF WCARO,
the EQs were rationalised under the OECD/DAC heading to improve consistency and reduce overlaps. The
revised EQs are presented below.
The Evaluation Matrix is presented in Error! Reference source not found.. The Matrix presents the
indicators for each evaluation question, and outlines data collection methods and the main sources of
evidence assessed to determine findings. An overview of the EQs is presented in Table 7-1 below.

8 Methodology
8.1 Approach of the evaluation
The approach was theory-based and utilisation focused and drew upon a mixed-method data collection
combining quantitative and qualitative methods for primary data collection as well as quantitative and
qualitative secondary data from available ASWA-SL documentation. The back-bone of the quantitative
approach was a survey based on a structured questionnaire similar to the WASH SDG baseline survey
which also served as baseline for ASWA-SL y, in combination with available statistical data. In addition,
structured data collection tools were used for recording observations of the facilities implemented
through the programme.
For the qualitative enquiry, semi-structured questionnaires were used for key informant interviews (KIIs)
with key implementing partners and national and district stakeholders and for the focus group discussions
(FGDs) with communities and end beneficiaries. Particular emphasis was placed on the impact/ effect on
the key beneficiaries in the three programme districts: children under five, adolescent girls and boys, and
women. Women, men, and youth groups were consulted to ensure that their opinions and priority needs
were fully captured in the evaluation of the programme design, results, and challenges. The consultations
also included female and male household heads, out-of-school children, persons living with disabilities,
local community leaders, members of WASH Committees, teachers, school management committee
members, community health workers, health facility staff, and religious leaders.
8.2 Sampling methods and data collection tools
8.2.1 Quantitative Sampling Strategy
The quantitative sampling design was based on purposive and random sampling method. The end-line
survey aims for a district-level before and after comparison between the 2016 SGD baseline survey20 and
the 2020 end-line survey on the changes that occurred on the key ASWA indicators that might be
attributed to the ASWA interventions. The 2016 SDG baseline survey selected Enumeration Areas (EAs)
and sampled 30 localities in each of Bonthe and the old Koinadugu districts. For each of the localities
visited for the SDG baseline survey 20 households were selected giving a total of 600 households in each
district, the actual numbers of households sampled were very close to this. This figure was used as a guide
to the magnitude of the household sample required. However, a preliminary comparison of the chiefdom/
section/ locality data in the UNICEF progress work sheets with similar data in the baseline results showed
that in some cases there were very few or no ASWA interventions in the 2016 SDG baseline EAs. As
discussed below the evaluation team opted for 40 localities in Bonthe and 40 localities shared between
Koinadugu and Falaba with a sample of 15 households in each locality.
After obtaining coordinates for most of the ASWA interventions we compared these locations on GIS with
shape files of the EAs where the 2016 SDG baseline survey was carried out and this gave a more accurate
picture which showed a smaller overlap than indicated in the preliminary assessment. In the following
20 The Baseline was conducted when Koinadugu was single district but was later subdivided into two districts for the
purpose of the before and after comparison Koinadugu and Falaba are treated as a single district.

Localities in EA sample with CLTS 69 6 17
% of all CLTS localities sampled by baseline 20.6% 3.5% 5.8%
Table 8-2: WINC localities falling within baseline EAs.
We proposed to UNICEF that we would then split the sample in the approximate ratio of 70% to 30%
respectively between the treatment localities (where there had been ASWA interventions) and ‘control’
localities (where the baseline survey had been carried out but where ASWA had not been active).
The few localities where the baseline had been carried out and where there had been ASWA interventions
as well were included as far as possible.
The 2016 SDG baseline results would be taken as representative of their respective districts as a whole,
which was the intention of that survey, and would provide a starting point against which to compare the
results of the interventions, as captured in the survey of the treatment localities, (end line survey).
The results from the second, repeated surveys in the baseline localities would provide information on
background changes independent of the ASWA interventions. An example of this background change
could be national messages on hand washing and hygiene connected with the Ebola and Covid-19
epidemics. This approach was accepted by UNICEF and the detailed sampling was made.

8.2.1.1 Sampling process
Random and purposive sampling approaches were considered. Random sampling allows statistical
calculation of confidence limits for a given sampling set up. For large populations, a relatively small sample
can provide reasonable confidence, and this was the case with the household end line surveys. With small
populations however, proportionally larger samples are required, and this was the case with the WINC
and WINS interventions. The large difference between the numbers of CLTS interventions and the
numbers of WINC and WINS interventions meant that random sampling of the CLTS localities might not
have resulted in an adequate or representative sample of WINC and WINS interventions and some types
of intervention might not have been represented at all. This would have required additional visits to
localities to obtain a representative sample of and time constraints did not allow this. For this reason, a
purposive sampling approach was used which allowed us to ensure representative sampling by
considering a number of characteristics.
The selection of treatment and baseline localities rather than including all localities in the chiefdom was
also based on a purposive approach.
CLTS sampling
In selecting CLTS localities the following characteristics were considered:
− Locality population size, so a mixture of large, medium, and small localities
− Chiefdoms, the sample should approximately reflect the actual numbers of interventions in each
chiefdom. This meant that in cases where there had been very few interventions,(e.g. Kamukeh
chiefdom in Koinadugu, 1 intervention), these chiefdoms were omitted.
− Implementing Partners should also be represented in approximate proportion to the number of
localities where they had been active.
− In view of the time constraints for carrying out the field work, localities with a representative
sample of WINS and WINC interventions were also included so that survey teams could carry out
household surveys and survey WINC and WINS facilities during the same visit.
− Localities were grouped so as to reduce time travelling between them.
The availability of coordinates for the processed ASWA interventions allowed the locations to be projected
in QGIS and compared with administrative boundaries and other features and this facilitated the
preparation of the sample. In each sampled locality up to 15 households were selected using the random
walk method.
Assuming the purposive approach described above produced a sample equally as valid as a randomly
selected sample the confidence21 limits for the designed and realised samples are as follows:
21 Guidance for calculation of confidence limits: www.surveysystem.com/sscalc.htm
31
Table 8-3: Confidence limits for planned CLTS samples
Table 8-4: Confidence limits for realised CLTS samples.
WINC sampling
Localities with WINC interventions were selected so as to provide a representative sample using the
following characteristics:
− To provide a sample which approximately reflected the proportions of the different types of
facilities. In Koinadugu and Falaba there were 8 gravity flow water systems (GFS) which combined
served a very large proportion of the population served by ASWA, so the number of these systems
sampled was increased to reflect their relative importance.
− Localities were selected to sample the different implementing partners. This was made simpler as
to a certain extent IPs preferred different water supply technologies.
WINS sampling
A similar approach to WINC sampling was used for WINS projects but in this case there were fewer water
supply technologies to take into account. The sanitation interventions were relatively uniform between
schools, so no additional steps were required to achieve a representative sample of these facilities.
8.2.1.2 Problems and limitations with sampling method
The term treatment and control are used in a simplified fashion to connote comparison group of a before
and after method. They do not represent the fundamental experimental control-treatment design. No
shape file was available for roads and rivers, and while this eliminated any possibility of bias towards more
accessible localities it also resulted in some practical difficulties in the field, for example to reach Yiraya in
Falaba the team had to pass through Guinea.
The severe road conditions and longer distances in Koinadugu and Falaba also resulted in fewer of the
sampled localities being visited in these districts. More localities could have been visited by avoiding less
accessible locations, but this would have made the sample less representative.
The small numbers of localities or schools with ASWA interventions would have required proportionally
large samples to achieve statistically valid results, see table below, and this would not have been realistic

8.2.2 Qualitative Sampling Strategy
The primary data collection method used both qualitative and quantitative sampling techniques. The
purpose of the qualitative enquiry is to learn from respondents who have knowledge and experience of
the planning, implementation and deriving benefits from the results of the ASWA interventions. The
sampling strategy drew from purposive sampling techniques22 to recruit participants who can provide in-
depth and detailed information about the ASWA program that is been evaluated. The techniques were
deliberate and subjective choices that ensure participants have knowledge and experience of the program
at the execution, implementation, and beneficiary levels.
The purposive sampling target MDAs and Local councils that were involved in the ASWA planning,
oversight, and implementation, as well as communities and schools that directly benefited from these
interventions i.e. community and school water supply, and the CLTS and SLTS. The purposive sampling
target section of respondents for the Key Informant Interviews (KII) and for the focus group discussions
at community Level.
The Target Respondents for the KIIs were planned to be conducted at national, district and community
levels. The following KIIs were purposively selected:
1. Executing MDAs:
i. Ministry of Water Resources (MWR), Directorate of Water resource (Director/Deputy,
Head of M&E and Rural Water supply Units) with a focus on Water Supply responsibilities
and ASWA-SL interventions.
ii. Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MHS) Department of Environmental Sanitation
(Director/Deputy, Head of M&E and Senior WASH Officer) focusing on Sanitation mandate
of the sector and ASWA-SL intervention.
iii. Min. of Basic and Senior Secondary Education (MBSSE) (Director of planning and head of
WASH in Schools) focusing on school WASH and ASWA interventions.
22 See Statistic Solutions (2020) Qualitative Sampling Technique
33
iv. Min. of Local Government and Community Development (MLGCD), (Director DecSec,
Director of Local Government and M&E Manager) focusing on Decentralized WASH
services and ASWA-SL.
2. Non-Executing MDAs:
i. Chief Gender Specialist, Ministry of Gender and Children Affairs (MGCA), and the
ii. Commissioner/Deputy, National Commission for Persons with Disability (NCPD)
3. UNICEF Sierra Leone Country Office:
Chief WASH Officer, WASH Specialist, Planning & Monitoring, Education, Child Protection, EPSP
Section
4. District Councils in Bonthe and Koinadugu:
The KIIs targeted the Development Planning Officer/the M&E Officer/ the WASH Officer as well
as the District Health Management Team and the MWR WASH Engineers and Water Point
Mappers stationed in the Districts/ Regions.
5. District-level Implementing Partners (IPs):
i. NGO Implementing Partners
6. Community/-Institutional Level:
i. Head Teacher and a female teacher, in the target beneficiary communities’ primary
schools
ii. Midwife/head, Peripheral Health Units (PHU) in beneficiary communities
7. Private sector service providers
Private sector actors such as hand pump mechanics, hand pump spare parts dealers, sanitation
materials manufacturers and suppliers.
8. Focus Group Discussion (FGDs)
The selection of FGD participants was done in consultation with the Community Leadership with
the aim of a balanced representation of the groups in the communities. At the community entry
engagement of the community leaders the purpose and the type of the Focus groups to be target
was discussed. The community leaders facilitated the identification of the relevant group
targeted.

Sanitation programme, the WASH M&E framework report, M&E reports, Akvo reports, sector
websites, Akvo monitoring tools, the Decentralisation Policy, public health strategy documents
(EPICOME), the PRSP and national development plans, national and district WASH plans (annual
and medium term), WAP studies performed for other WASH projects.
8.2.4 Primary data collection
Qualitative and quantitative data was collected through household surveys, key informant interviews
(KIIs), focus group discussions (FGDs), community meetings, and observation. Relevant stakeholders were
engaged, including staff of the national level ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs), district
councils, communities, and institutions in the target areas.
Key Informant Interviews (KII)
Purpose: The aim of the KIIs was to contribute to the evaluation objective of accountability and learning
by engaging both the stakeholders that were involved in the planning and/ or in the implementation of
the program and other relevant non-executing agencies that are involved with Gender, Equity and Human
Right issues. The KIIs allowed the evaluation team to obtain different experiences, views and perspectives
of key stakeholders related to the program and relevant policy actions.
35
Target Respondents: The KIIs were planned to be conducted at national, district and community levels.
The following KIIs were targeted:
The KIIs targeted respondents from the executing MDAs and relevant non-executing MDAs, at national
level. An initial interview was arranged with two to three key staff in the MDA followed by individual
interviews with specialists as needed.
At district level, the WASH team in the Bonthe and Koinadugu Local Councils, District Health Management
Team (DHMT) and the District MWR Engineers were interviewed. Initial common meetings were followed
by individual interviews as needed.
At the community level, head teachers and female teachers were interviewed in a selection of schools
also covered by the end-line survey. KII were also conducted with the responsible persons of community
peripheral health units to gather information mainly on the incidence and prevalence of water and excreta
related diseases and mortality.
To prevent the spread of COVID-19, face-to-face interviews were carried out with strict social distance
(two meters) and the provision and use of face masks for both the respondents and data collectors.
The KIIs were conducted as semi-structured interviews with interview guides elaborated for each
stakeholder type, and the responses were voice recorded and notes were taken manually and using
tablets. The KII guides are provided in Appendix 5 Data Collection Tools. For each KII, the evaluation team
first established the respondents’ area of expertise and experience with ASWA-SL to focus the discussion
on topics that the interviewee was knowledgeable about and areas of concern to the interviewee.
Focus Group Discussions (FGDs)
FGDs were conducted to contribute to the evaluation objective of accountability and learning from end
beneficiaries at community level. They also enabled triangulation and verification of the results presented
in progress reports. The FGDs were conducted in communities and schools that benefited directly from
ASWA-SL. The focus groups covered the following stakeholder categories:
− Community Leadership including Chiefs and elders.
− Women’s groups
− Youth groups (male and female with a special interview on women specific questions)
− Pupils (boys and girls with a special interview on girl specific questions)
− School Management Committees and Parent Teacher Associations including male and female
teachers.
The FGDs were carried out in a selection of communities also covered by the end-line survey. They were
conducted as semi-structured discussions with FGD guides elaborated for each stakeholder type, and the
responses were voice recorded and notes were taken manually and using tablets. The FGD guides are
provided in Appendix 5 Data Collection Tools.
The FGDs were administered by the field teams. The focus group participants were identified in
consultation with the District WASH Team, the IPs, and the community leadership as well as at the
initiative of the survey supervisors. The selection respected the ‘do-no-harm’ principle and avoided stigma
attached to participants’ situations.
36
The FGDs were limited to between five and seven participants per group. The FGDs were done in an open
or well-ventilated and safe area for both the respondents and the facilitators following strict social
distancing rules (two meters) and providing and using face masks and hand sanitizers by both the
respondents and data collectors.
End-line survey in communities and institutions
A household survey was conducted to contribute to the evaluation objective of accountability and learning
from experiences of the households and institutions during the implementation of the projects and the
results and outcomes for the respective households and institutions. The survey provided quantitative
data on results collected at household and school level and enabled a broad coverage of end-beneficiaries.
The survey targeted 30 enumeration areas (EAs) and 15 respondents per EA (450) in each of the two target
districts (Bonthe and Koinadugu/ Falaba) to allow for comparison to the initial SDG baseline survey with a
similar sample size.
The survey results were complemented by FGD findings on the effects of ASWA-SL. As well known in Sierra
Leone traditionally and also confirmed by the FGDs, WASH services have a tendency to be seen as the
responsibility of women in the households, both as caregivers and the main collectors and users of water
in the household. For these key reasons, mainly women (young, adults and the elderly) were targeted by
the survey.
A structured questionnaire was used, and the responses were recorded with tablet/mobile phone data
collection instruments. The questionnaires are presented in Appendix 5 Data Collection Tools.
Observation of facilities constructed.
The facilities constructed by ASWA-SL were inspected to contribute to the evaluation objective of
accountability and learning from the functionality and quality of the WASH services provided by the
programme at community level. It enabled the verification of physical results and assessment of the
appropriateness, quality, maintenance, and functionality of the infrastructure constructed by the
programme. The following types of infrastructure were observed:
− Community water supply
− Community/household sanitation
− School water supply
− School Sanitation services
The observations of facilities constructed with ASWA-SL support were carried out in a selection of
communities also covered by the end-line survey.
A checklist of observation tools was developed for the assessment of the appropriateness, functionality
and quality of WASH services supported by the project. Photos were taken of the infrastructure to
document quality and operation and maintenance (O&M) status. The findings were recorded with
tablet/mobile phone data collection instruments. The observation checklist is included in Appendix 5 Data
Collection Tools. detailed findings are presented in ‘Appendix 7 Facilities Observations Checklist’.
37
8.2.5 Data on ASWA interventions
The data provided on interventions was limited to a single workbook containing worksheets for CLTS
interventions, Wash in community (WINC) facilities and Wash in schools (WINS) facilities. The types of
data presented in these worksheets were as follows:
ID and location data Population details Progress reporting Other data
CLTS Chiefdom/section Disaggregated Numbers of facilities Implementing
locality population data constructed partner
WINC Chiefdom/section Disaggregated Type of facility Implementing
locality population data constructed partner
WINS Chiefdom/section/school Disaggregated school Type of facility Implementing
name and type enrolment data constructed partner
8.2.5.1 Location data
The most surprising omission from the data was position coordinates. Position coordinates were required
by the evaluation team for the following reasons:
− Projecting the data onto GIS gives an immediate impression of the distribution of the
interventions and facilities and their relationship with one another.
− Accurate positions also facilitate the checking and processing of data, for example, the actual
position in GIS in relation to administrative boundaries allows checking and correction of the
chiefdom, section, and locality names by comparing with data from other sources. Errors in
coordinates, if manual transcription used, are immediately visible if projected onto satellite
imagery as the position may not coincide with a settlement or school.
− Use of GIS facilitates the sampling process.
− GIS also allows more visually instructive presentations to be made.
The lack of coordinates meant that the ASWA administrative location data would have to be matched with
location data from other sources23 in order to obtain the coordinates, however, this data also had a large
number of inconsistencies, for example:
− Some section names in the lists did not match any actual section names for these districts.
− In many cases the chiefdom, section and locality names were not consistent with each other.
− Some locality names suffered from errors of transcription, and this required investigative work
in each case.
− Comparing the administrative location names to those in the 2015 Population and Housing
Census showed many differences in spelling which prevented the effective use of Excel formulae
such as INDEX/MATCH. This approach only captured 2-3% of the localities so the remaining 97-
98% had to be corrected manually.
23 The following data bases were used as sources of coordinates: 2015 Population and Housing Survey (PHC 2015);
2018 Education Management Information System survey (EMIS 2018); 2016 Water Point Mapping survey (WPM
2016); Baseline survey database (Baseline 2016)
38
− Some location data was missing, e.g. in the WINS worksheet there was no column for locality
name, this was included in the name of the school, but was missing for 14 of the schools.
Some examples of the of incorrect data with brief explanations of the corrections applied are included in
‘Appendix 6 ASWA Communities and Survey Samples’.
8.3 Data collection, Analysis and Quality Assurance
The analysis carried out comprised:
i. A comparative analysis of the baseline and end-line survey data
ii. An analysis of the evaluation criteria and the information related to the EQs.
In addition to analysis the evaluation criteria, the effectiveness of ASWA-SL was assessed from the
achievement of the reported results compared to the programme results framework. The analysis in the
overall evaluation matrix (see: Error! Reference source not found.) was used to identify under each EQ
and the indicators defined for the EQs, the type of information expected from the document review, the
KIIs, the FGDs, the end-line surveys and the observations checklist, respectively. References were included
for the respective questions on the guides used for the KIIs and FGDs to enable referring to the relevant
answers for the qualitative analysis.
The analytical tools applied included triangulation: Data from different primary sources (KIIs, FGDs, end-
line survey, observation of facilities) and secondary sources (baseline survey, programme documentation,
statistical data) were analysed and compared to validate and assess the strength of the findings. Findings
from different sources were compared, both in terms of comparing stakeholder consultation and site
inspection data with information from documents, but also by comparing findings from different KIIs and
FGDs, and comparing information obtained from KIIs/FGDs with different stakeholder types in order to
understand different perspectives.
Special attention was paid to assess the extent of achievement of the intended results, especially with
respect to open defecation and its resultant effect on children’s sanitary environment both at home and
in schools, and the benefit of reducing waterborne diseases and learning outcomes for children.
The impact evaluation was based on a comparison of the situation before and after the programme,
establishing differences between the baseline benchmarks and the end-line survey data.
8.3.1 Timeline of the evaluation
A contract for undertaking the evaluation (contract no 43288363) was signed between UNICEF and
PEMconsult on the 11th of November 2019, and the inception period for the evaluation started
immediately after contract signing. The final draft Inception report was submitted on the 5th of February
2020 and subsequently discussed with the Evaluation Reference Group (ERG) on the 21st of February 2020
and thereafter finalised and submitted on the 10th of March 2020.
The emergence of the COVID-19 global pandemic resulted in some delays in the implementation of the
evaluation as travel restrictions affected field work and required the development of detailed data
39
collection tools for the Sierra Leone-based team members with the internationally-based team worked
remotely. The data collection modalities and tools were finalised in November 2020. A document review
and drafting of a preliminary report, based on the desk review was carried out in October – November
2020.
The data collection for the evaluation started immediately after finalising the tools, 11 months after the
end of the ASWA programme. Key informant interviews (KIIs) with national stakeholders were carried out
in November – December 2020. Mobilisation and training of enumerators was carried out in November
2020 and the fieldwork, including focus group discussions (FGDs) at community and school level,
interviews in districts and communities, household and school surveys, and facility observations were
carried in December 2020.
The qualitative and quantitative data analysis was done in December 2020 – January 2021. A draft
evaluation report was submitted in January 2021. The timeline for the completion of the evaluation is
illustrated in Figure 8-1.
Figure 8-1:Timeline for completing the evaluation.
8.4 Validation of Findings
The Evaluation Reference Group (ERG) consisting of UNICEF, Statistics Sierra Leone (the country’s Central
Statistics Office), Ministry of Planning and Economic Development, National Monitoring and Evaluation
Directorate, Ministry of Water Resources and Ministry of Health and Sanitation officials were consulted
during the inception of the evaluation.
This draft report was presented and discussed at a “findings and sense-making” workshop. This event
provided the opportunity for UNICEF and a selection of its partners to validate and respond to the initial
evaluation findings. Prior to the workshop, an electronic copy of the draft report was shared with UNICEF
and relevant stakeholder for reviewing. The comments received on the draft report were assessed and
the final evaluation report elaborated, taking the comments received into consideration.

8.5 Ethical Considerations and Evaluation Principles
The evaluation fully adhered to the ethical standards of UNICEF (e.g., Norms and Standards for Evaluation;
Report Standards Checklist for Evaluation Reports) and the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG24).
During the evaluation inception phase, the evaluation teams in dialogue with UNICEF planned how data
collection would be conducted in line with UNICEF’s ethical standards, including UNICEF’s procedures for
ethical research involving children.
The evaluation team members had no prior engagement in ASWA-SL. The six obligations for evaluators
(independence, impartiality, credibility, conflicts of interest, honesty and integrity, and accountability)
were duly applied in the conduct of the evaluation as follows:
− Independence: None of the evaluation team members had any prior or ongoing engagement in
ASWA-SL.
− Impartiality: A wide range of stakeholders were consulted to obtain different perspectives and cover
different interests – covering all types of stakeholders, including UNICEF staff, IPs, GoSL managerial
and technical staff at central and sub-national level, development partners, school management,
teachers, committees, different community groups, incl. leaderships WASH committees, VSLAs,
women and female-headed households, youth (women and men), people living with disabilities,
school children (girls and boys).
− Credibility: The terminal evaluation team comprised senior experts in evaluation methodologies,
surveys, WASH, infrastructure, gender. Data and information from different sources (primary and
secondary, quantitative, and qualitative) were compared and triangulated, and major discrepancies
found are clearly described in the evaluation report.
− Conflicts of interest: None of the evaluation team members had any prior or ongoing engagement in
ASWA-SL.
− Honesty and integrity: All experts on the evaluation team were well-known to PEMconsult and
trusted. All primary data collected by national field team was analysed by international experts. An
evaluation expert that had not been involved in the data collection and analysis carried out a
thorough quality assurance of the draft report.
− Accountability: The evaluation team maintained a dialogue with the client. Stakeholders were given
the opportunity to comment on key findings (positive and negative). The draft report was shared
with the client for comments. All comments received were carefully assessed.
Care was taken to present facts, findings and issues, conclusions, and recommendations in a
comprehensive and balanced manner; based on data and observations that are considered reliable and
trustworthy with respect to the quality of the instruments, procedures and analyses used to collect and
interpret the information. The evaluation had ethical clearance from the Sierra Leone Research and Ethical
Council, Ministry of Health and Sanitation and respected the ethics of research when working with diverse
population groups. The team respected the right of institutions and individuals to provide information in
confidence and ensured that sensitive data cannot be traced to their source, unless prior and informed
consent was given.
24 For example UNEG (2008) Code of Conduct for Evaluation in the UN System; UNEG (2010) Quality Checklist for an
Evaluation
41
With regard to handling of sensitive topics of child abuse, risks of sexual exploitation, and gender-based
violence from communities, during the early discussion with UNICEF Sierra Leone’s Child Protection
Specialist and Education Officer, the following recommendations25 were developed, communicated to the
field team, and applied in the data collection:
• It was explained clearly to respondents that responses were anonymous and will be treated
confidentially, and that the evaluation team will not intervene in the community, but only use the
responses for learning and to inform future programming. It was also clarified that the evaluation
would discuss risks and mitigating factors without discussing actual cases.
• School Management Committee and teachers at schools were interviewed.
• Women’s group leaders were consulted.
The Team Leader, PEMconsult established the approach to ethics during the inception phase and made
team members aware of it:
1. The evaluation shall adhere to independent and objective principles of an evaluation.
2. Evaluation team shall adhere to high quality of service and good evaluation practices based on
standards prescribed in United Nation Evaluation Group (UNEG).
3. Evaluation team shall be responsible for identifying the need for and securing any necessary ethics’
approval for the study in the country.
4. The evaluation team and representatives in fieldwork shall avoid harm to participants in studies
including women and children.
5. Participation in evaluation should be voluntary based on informed consent, and the evaluators and
representatives should ensure confidentiality of information, privacy, and anonymity of study
participants.
6. Ensure that the evaluation team respected the right of institutions and individuals to provide
information in confidence, and the sources of specific information and opinions contained in this report
are not disclosed, except where necessary and only after confirmation by the person consulted.
7. The evaluation team shall respect ethical consideration of women, girls and boys, the subjects of the
evaluations.
8. The evaluation team should operate in accordance with international human rights conventions and
covenants.
9. The evaluation team shall respect all sensitive cultural norms.
10. The Research and evaluation team of the evaluation is completely independent of those
implementing the ASWA intervention or programme under study.
11. The evaluation team has ensured particular emphasis on the participation of women and socially
excluded groups.

8.6 Limitations and mitigation measures
A number of limitations affected the evaluation. These limitations related either to the conduct of the
evaluation activities (e.g. COVID-19 affecting data collection and the team’s in-country interactions), or to
the availability of information, in particular vis-à-vis the impact and sustainability criteria.
The evaluation was not expected to include an opinion or audit of the accounts or the administration of
ASWA-SL funds. Hence, the findings do not address the efficiency in terms of proper accounting of funds
and possible misappropriation.
A major limitation of the evaluation was the timing and design of the baseline survey for ASWA-SL. The
baseline was conducted in 2016, four years after the ASWA-SL programme was initiated, and was a
national study carried out by Statistics Sierra Leone with support from UNICEF and other partners, such
as AfDB, to set a general baseline for the WASH related SDG indicators. UNICEF used this as a baseline for
districts covered by ASWA-SL.26 Since the baseline survey was conducted three years into effective
programme implementation, some tangible WASH results might well have been delivered in a number of
beneficiary communities prior to the baseline. Hence, it was not possible to fully establish and quantify
the impact of ASWA-SL. In the time between start of ASWA-SL in 2013 and the baseline survey in 2016,
Sierra Leone was seriously affected by the Ebola pandemic, so the baseline described the post-Ebola
situation and while the differences (baseline to end-line) do not describe development through the
implementation period, it clearly indicated changes attributable to ASWA-SL activities.
Another limitation was staff turnover, particularly with respect to international UNICEF staff, who are on
a staff rotation, and the associated loss of institutional memory of the early years of ASWA-SL
implementation and in particular the design of ASWA-SL. It was also difficult to access documents from
the early stages of ASWA-SL. The evaluation team also did not have access to complete data on the
communities included in ASWA-SL to assess the total number of communities and the target populations.
The available data did not have coordinates for the location of the communities making sampling for the
end-line survey more difficult27.
A proper analysis of impact would ideally require counterfactual information of what those outcomes
would have been in the absence of the intervention. Although the ToR stated that an analysis of two
comparison districts were to be included in the end-line survey, this was deemed of limited value as other
donors besides UNICEF were supporting WASH activities in the remaining districts, and as such there are
no “control” districts available in Sierra Leone.
Hence, the methodology employed for assessing impact was partly qualitative and descriptive in nature.
At the community level this is appropriate, and issues of attribution are of less concern as UNICEF had
defined programme areas. However, when considering impacts at the national level related to the
enabling environment, establishing the counterfactual was more challenging.
26 The ASWA-SL baseline report is dated 2018.
27 The identification of location of the ASWA-SL target communities had to be stablished manually by comparing
locality names with census data – this is very cumbersome due to different spelling of locality names.
43
Although the evaluation attempted to gauge the impact of the program on the entire target population,
it placed emphasis on the impact of the program on children (girls and boys) under age five, adolescent
girls and boys, and women. A number of evaluation questions (EQs) addressed the results in relation to
gender, age and people with disabilities and information is provided in particular from the FGDs and KIIs
at local level. It was, however, in most cases impossible to obtain monitoring data that was disaggregated
accordingly.
Attribution of results was challenging for the evaluation, as the extent to which other WASH programmes
in Sierra Leone, or inputs from other stakeholders have contributed to changes observed, was not always
clear. Smaller programmes and grants were active in the same thematic area. The DGIS funded ASWA-SL
was implemented in two districts, while at the same time the UK Department for International
Development (DfID) funded ASWA-SL in rural 11 rural districts, with similar objectives, while in addition
also focusing on WASH in health centres. The DfID-funded ASWA-SL also targeted improving the enabling
environment for WASH and strengthening policies at the national level. Efforts were made to clearly
highlight areas where other organisations may have contributed to the changes observed.
The available ASWA-SL documentation contained limited evidence on the specific outcomes for youth,
elderly, people with disabilities and the poor, due to a lack of disaggregated data available for these
groups. This posed a limitation for the ability to quantify the outcomes for vulnerable groups, as included
in the various EQs and indicators. The assessment of the outcomes for the groups was thus mainly based
on the primary qualitative field data collected by the evaluation. The evaluation team was not supplied
with programme design documents relating to assessments of vulnerability of the target population,
which would have been a valuable source of information.
The information provided to the evaluation team in the form of the December 2019 Progress report
workbook was incomplete, contained numerous errors and also did not provide any position coordinates
for any facility. The evaluation team spent considerable time correcting and completing the data and also
matched about 90% of the localities with SSL localities and so was able to obtain locality position
coordinates. This is further detailed in Chapter 8.2.1.2 and in Appendix 6 ASWA Communities and Survey
Samples.
There still remain errors in this information, for example facility types are sometimes incorrect or may not
actually exist at the locality indicated.
The 10 CEDA solar BH piped water systems in Bonthe were also omitted, together with an unknown
number of similar systems built by WVI.
The restrictions on movement in response to the COVID-19 pandemic affected the data collection. Field
trips were postponed, and the international evaluation team members could only to a limited extent
participate in a limited number of facility observations and in a limited number of KIIs through VoIP
services. The survey, FGDs and most KIIs were carried out by the national team.

UNICEF objectives
The strategies used in ASWA-SL were strongly aligned with UNICEF’s strategies – at the country level, and
at the global strategy level in WASH. The strategies in ASWA-SL aimed at addressing the challenges as
described in the UNICEF Country Programme Documents CPDs (see section 1.0) in the period (CPD 2013-
2014; CPD 2015-2018) that consistently demonstrated that access to water and sanitation facilities in
schools was low, and low levels of access to rural WASH existed, being considerably lower than in urban
areas.
UNICEF CPDs indicate that low levels of access to WASH have contributed to diarrhoeal disease, acute
respiratory infection (ARIs) and undernutrition among children in Sierra Leone. ASWA-SL plans were in
line with the intention in the CPDs of UNICEF’s WASH programme addressing bottlenecks in investment
plans. While the CPDs did not specifically refer to ASWA-SL, or vice versa, there was a high degree of

2015-2018) to support national efforts to accelerate the realization of the rights of children by improving
access to services, developing the capacity of systems, building resilience among households and
communities, and providing social protection to the poorest and most vulnerable families.
ASWA-SL aimed to contribute to cumulative targets in the CPD cycle ending in 2019. Particularly in the
area of rural sanitation, the programme contributed to UNICEF’s ‘Sanitation Game Plan’ to eliminate open
defecation, and the second phase of ASWA is building on the lessons of ASWA-SL. A key result area for
children in the 2019 Annual Work plan was ending open defecation.
UNICEF’s Global Strategy in WASH (2006-2015) highlighted the three pillars of balanced WASH
programming: support to enabling environments, behaviour change, and water and sanitation services.
ASWA-SL very broadly addressed all three of these pillars in a balanced way. The Global Strategy also
outlined strategies “in other countries” (i.e. countries not in transition/emergency):
1. Improving hygiene awareness and promoting behaviour change: ASWA-SL Result Area 2 and 4
2. Drinking water quality: ASWA-SL Result Area 1.
3. WASH emergency preparedness: Not addressed – except for the flexibility in reallocating program
funding for Ebola response activities.
4. National monitoring for achievement of MDGs: ASWA-SL Result Area 5
As such, ASWA-SL was highly aligned with UNICEF’s global strategy in WASH, with its primary objectives
linked to three out of four of UNICEF’s strategies for countries that are not responding to emergencies.
National plans
ASWA-SL supported relevant national plans, strategies, and agreements. There was a high degree of
strategic coherence between ASWA-SL and national plans: ASWA-SL supported the development and
implementation of national plans of action, which resulted from the SWA initiative. The programme was
designed to contribute to the NWSP (2010) and the Agenda for Change (2009-13), and the Agenda for
Prosperity (2013-2017). It was also broadly aligned to Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) IV, and the
new medium-term National Development Plan (2019-23). The programme was designed to not only
implement and scale up WASH in the targeted districts, but also to build government capacity and systems
that contribute to the enabling environment for WASH.
Over the period of implementation ASWA-SL played a part in supporting many principal WASH policies,
strategies, and national guidelines, showing a strong alignment between the programme and GoSL’s
WASH sector priorities. Some of these national policies and guidelines included: WASH in schools
guidelines (2017), WASH in healthcare facilities guidelines (2017), the national CLTS protocol (2018), and
the ongoing WASH policy review (2019 – onwards). It is generally acknowledged that ASWA-SL, due to its
scope that included support to developing the national WASH policy and strategy framework, and the
strength of UNICEF’s influence and advocacy on the national WASH sector, led to such alignment.
As mentioned above, the programme was in alignment with a) the NWSP (2010) in water supply and
sanitation and the National Decentralization Policy (2010) that aimed to decentralise primary/basic
services, such as basic education, primary health and rural water supply; and b) the PRSP III in the
operation and maintenance of water supply and sanitation facilities with encourages greater involvement
of NGOs, the private sector, and utilisation of community based approaches as per the Sanitation and
47
Water for All (SWA) commitments made by the GoSL. ASWA-SL also supported a number of review
conferences where key counterparts devised plans on sector strengthening.
National stakeholders (MDAs) in the WASH sector affirmed that the program was aligned with the WASH
policy and plans of GoSL. ASWA-SL aimed at improving water and sanitation in rural areas and WASH in
schools. However, MWR was not in existence during the planning phase of ASWA-SL. In addition, cross-
cutting ministries, and agencies such as the Ministry of Gender and Children Affairs and the National
Commission for Persons with Disability (NCPD), were reportedly not involved in the planning of ASWA-SL.
A key concern across the ministries was not being involved with the supervision and quality control of
ASWA-SL interventions in the districts.
District plans
Coherence with sub-national plans was not fully reflected in the ASWA-SL programme design since the
identification of needs at the district level was only carried out during ASWA-SL implementation. During
the course of ASWA-SL implementation, GoSL developed the National Rural Water Supply and Sanitation
Programme (NRWSSP) in 2015-17, which further details the planning and coordination processes in the
districts. The NRWSSP has been approved by GoSL at high level and guides the sector, although no formal
implementation has yet started.
Districts are expected to have water and sanitation plans that guide all implementation and coordinate
activities. At the district level, UNICEF, through ASWA-SL funding for monitoring activities, partnered with
District Councils and involved them in identifying district and chiefdom/ community priorities. As such,
ASWA-SL supported the districts to identify needs and align their responses to these more
systematically.29
Most of UNICEF’s Implementing Partners (IPs) reported that ASWA-SL interventions were aligned to
international, national, and sub-national policy and standards. Some IPs interviewed expressed the
following: “We have an implementation and community engagement strategy, which LEAVES NO ONE
BEHIND”; and “The national policies mandates education and provision of menstrual hygiene. This keeps
the girl child at school better than before the intervention”. However, other IPs reported that they were
unaware of ASWA’s alignment with, and contribution to, the development of the country’s national WASH
policies.
International WASH policy and standards
ASWA-SL was designed in the MDG era (up to 2015), while the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,
in particular SDG 6 came into force during the course of programme implementation (2016 – present).
MDG 7, specifically Target 7C, was addressed by ASWA-SL: “By 2015, halve the proportion of people
without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation”. The SDGs broadened the scope
to “safely managed water and sanitation for all”. The ASWA-SL programme design was in line with the
MDG focus with the indicators for the programme being designed according to the MDGs, with a focus on
sustainability, water quality, access to basic sanitation through community led total sanitation (CLTS) and
supporting open defecation free communities.
29 Source: KII responses from IPs (CEDA and PACE) and Bonthe District Council Engineer
48
When the SDGs came into effect, the indicators were revised to reflect the new definitions. There does
not appear to have been a transition within the programme to address the wider shift to ‘safely managed’
facilities to reflect the different definitions outlined in the SDGs, however, the programme design
reflected well the international standards at the time of design. The focus in the programme on access to
basic water and sanitation services was in line with the national approach as for example expressed in the
NRWSSP. This approach had a more realistic focus on providing ‘basic services’ since the higher standard
of ‘safely managed services’ (e.g. on-site, 24 hour supply of potable water standard) remains difficult to
achieve in Sierra Leone (and most developing countries), considering the present level of WASH services,
sector challenges, and the aim of providing ‘some for all’ rather than ‘all for some’.
Sierra Leone joined the SWA partnership in 2010, and it is acknowledged that ASWA-SL (as part of the
larger ASWA-WCA programme) built on commitments made at SWA meetings.
Key findings related to EQ1:
FINDING 1.1: The strategies used in ASWA-SL were strongly aligned with UNICEF’s strategies – at the
country level, and at the global strategy level in WASH.
FINDING 1.2: ASWA-SL supported relevant national plans, strategies, and agreements. For example, the
preparation of the national guidelines for institutions, sanitation and hygiene strategy and development
of M&E systems.
FINDING 1.3: Coherence with sub-national plans was not fully reflected in the ASWA-SL programme
design, since the identification of needs at the district level was carried out during ASWA-SL
implementation.
9.1.2 EQ2 Relevance – identification of needs of groups
To what extent were the different needs and capacities of women and men and the specific needs of
children (girls and boys), persons living with disabilities, elderly people, marginalized households
identified during the design of the program and in programme components30
Stakeholder consultations
Broadly speaking, ASWA-SL responded to specific needs of different groups. For example, at the national
level, the WASH sector is geared towards identification of equity gaps and narrowing them in underserved
locations, to achieve Sierra Leone’s development goals. ASWA-SL targeted districts of high vulnerability.
The needs of vulnerable groups were identified through a sound assessment process that engaged local,
district, and national stakeholders31. The process attempted to identify and ensure the needs of various
groups within the population. The vulnerability assessments were conducted by UNICEF’s IPs before

49
implementation. According to IPs, the vulnerability analysis report32 was submitted and approved by the
local council for the agreed communities and localities to be targeted.
In line with UNICEF’s programme implementation strategy, the national and sub-national governments
led the discussion through consultative meetings with key sector actors, including NGOs and community
representatives. UNICEF ensured that the discussions were led by the government and at district-level
through various consultative forums33.
Implementing partners engaged all sectors through consultations with schools, local authorities, youth
leaders, and District Council representatives. Existing secondary data and pre-intervention assessments
provided needed information on the existing gaps in the sectors and areas of felt needs. At the community
level, participatory assessments were carried out to involve beneficiaries in providing information on the
status of WASH services in their communities and possible solutions and options they prefer.
ASWA was aligned to district-level development objectives and community-based priorities, and capacity
development needs. Stakeholders affirmed that ‘community-based approaches such as vulnerability
assessment were used to involve the beneficiaries in identifying their needs. Regular participatory
stakeholder engagement was the strategy employed during the implementation to ensure that all the
beneficiaries of the WASH facilities are involved in the needs assessment’.
The Programme Document stated that ASWA-SL ensured that women, men, girls, and boys were fully
involved in the design, implementation and maintenance of WASH infrastructure and services at
community level. However, the evidence of a meaningful input in these groups is limited. According to
MWR, national level stakeholders were involved in the identification of most important WASH needs for
all categories of the population including women, children, and vulnerable groups such as people living
with disabilities and the elderly.
The MDAs confirmed that they provided input in the program design on the side of GoSL through
consultations with technical and administrative staff and made relevant inputs with respect to the results
matrix and theory of change. The process was participatory and through direct engagement of heads of
units and presentations/ debriefings. In addition, some senior members were involved in international
workshops/ high-level engagement in pre-implementation/ formative stage of the program.
The National Commission for Person with Disability (NCPD) was not consulted in the planning or during
the implementation of the ASWA-SL. Concerning design of WASH programmes, the KII with the NCPD
noted that:
“affirmative actions must be taken firstly; we should be involved in the planning stage and allow to
participate on what is best for People Living With Disabilities (PLWD). Secondly, for accessibility to WASH
facilities we need an audit of our facilities. For instance, the doors in our facilities must be able to open
inside and the wheelchair must be able to turn in 360 degrees without hindrance and also our toilet should

violence and ease of access to WASH facilities, people with disabilities with regards to ease of access to WASH
facilities, poor and female headed household with regards to access to financial independence. However, a general
WASH assessment report was mentioned but not a specific vulnerability assessment report.

have hand bars/ handles for easy access. At the macro-level, the commission can be involved to give
technical advice”.
The Ministry of Gender and Children Affairs (MGCA) was also not involved in the formulation of ASWA-SL.
The KII responses from the ministry noted that GoSL and its partners should be guided by the Medium-
Term National Development Plan with specific reference to cluster 5 on ‘empowering women, children,
and persons with disability’; the National Gender Strategic Plan; and the Gender Equality and Women’s
Empowerment Policy. At operational level, there should be adequate consultations at every level involving
women, capacity building for women to actively participate in the processes, and measures to ensure
women are part of the WASH services committees, among others.
Stakeholders in the districts confirmed their involvement in the needs assessment of communities for the
implementation of ASWA-SL. The stakeholders provided guidance on the selection of communities that
should benefit from ASWA-SL, in order to a) avoid duplication of efforts of other organisations
implementing WASH projects in the district, and b) to ensure that communities in need benefited rather
than selecting communities at random.
UNICEF’s IPs generally reported that UNICEF consulted them at the outset of the intervention by sharing
the program concept and issuing calls for expressions of interest (EOI). When an IP was selected, an
agreement (PCA) which determines the objectives and areas of intervention was signed. Following the
signing of the PCA, using an inclusive strategy, the IPs worked with stakeholders (representatives from
Local Councils, DHMT, MEST, MWR, community chiefs, women, youth leaders and other beneficiaries) to
assess community needs. Vulnerable communities were identified and reported to UNICEF and
communities were selected using vulnerability criteria, such as the level of access to community and
school WASH services and wealth ranking. The following excerpt illustrates how IPs were involved in
programme design and planning: “PACE was very much involved in the planning, budgeting, and
implementation stage of programme intervention. My organization was involved in the assessment to
select beneficiary communities in collaboration with WASH MDAs and local stakeholders.”
Community leaders and the women confirmed communities’ involvement in needs assessment, planning
as well as in the implementations of the projects. Consultations were also said to have been done with all
the relevant groups in the communities. The youth shared different views on this; not being fully involved
in the planning nor during the needs assessment and not happy with the process of ASWA planning and
youth inclusion during the implementation process. There were instances mentioned by IPs that youths
wanted to be paid for their involvement. Community leaderships and Women revealed that communities
were happy with their level of involvement in the planning process.
Types of needs identified.
At the strategic level, ASWA-SL responded well to the needs of women and children. Overall, in the design
and planning of the programme, the needs of children were addressed through the intended programme
impact aiming at improving access to WASH and thereby improving children’s health. ASWA-SL’s rationale
addressed the link between improved access to safe water and sanitation and improved outcomes for
women and children – for example, that the lack of safe water supply makes women and girls walk long
distances to collect water, which in turn takes a physical toll on them, especially pregnant women.
Although the programme documents largely reference global research rather than local contextual
research, context-specific data on access to WASH in schools informed ASWA-SL design. The Programme
51
Document stressed ASWA-SL’s vision, to address WASH gender issues related to women, boys, and girls
within the rural communities. However, similar considerations were not evident for persons living with
disabilities, elderly people, and marginalized households (and there was no clear identification of
parameters for marginalized households).
At the programme level, ASWA-SL targeted support to children (girls and boys) through WASH in Schools
(WinS). Overall, the needs of children were targeted with the water and sanitation facilities and the
hygiene education activities; however there is little evidence that children’s’ needs, including addressing
sustainability challenges, were fully considered at design level. ASWA-SL activities in schools were part of
UNICEF’s support to ensure children have access to quality water and sanitation facilities in schools with
separated and differentiated toilets for girls and boys, as a strategy for retention of girls in school and
improving learning outcomes, as stipulated in the UNICEF Key Results for Children (KRC) 8.
There is no evidence that the design and implementation of the community component of ASWA included
the participation of children. There appears to have been an intent in design of ASWA to track progress
for children. Some of the objectively verifiable indicators (OVIs) in the Project Document contained
disaggregated indicators, some examples include: percentage of children aged 0-59 months with
diarrhoea in the past two weeks; percentage of children aged 5-14 years reported having diarrhoea in the
past two weeks; absenteeism rates in 170 schools (girls/boys).
In terms of project design, targeting women and people with disabilities was largely carried out through
WASH in Schools activities, however the evidence of targeting specific groups at community/ household
level is less convincing. The Education Sector Plan (ESP) 2007-2015 stipulates that all schools should have
girl-friendly and disabled friendly WASH facilities to improve the quality of primary education.34 However,
the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MEST)35 has no budget allocation for WASH in schools
and heavily relies on external support. WASH in schools is a significant part of the Child Friendly Schooling
standards, which MEST promotes to ensure the provision of favourable learning environment for every
child in the country.
The ASWA-WCA 2019 Progress Report highlighted that engagement of women and girls was an important
strategic programme shift for the new ASWA II. The report stated that empowering and engaging women
had been critical in the success of CLTS, Household Water Treatment (HHWT) and safe storage, and
community water engagement and that in the future, demonstrating more gender transformative
programming approaches would be necessary. Despite this, there does not appear to be convincing
evidence that such strategic programme priorities were made in ASWA-SL. The following summarises the
evidence for the inclusion of different vulnerable groups in the programme design:
− Targeting women: A reasonable WASH and gender narrative existed in the ASWA-SL Programme
Document. However, the existence of specific needs for women and girls was addressed solely
through WinS. Very broadly, the programme document outlined that gender was one of the priorities
in the PRSP including a commitment to have more women in elective and appointed positions,
reviewing discriminatory laws, and domesticating the Convention on the Elimination of all kinds of
34 Education Sector Plan 2007-2015. 2007. Ministry of Education, Science and Technology.
35 The Ministry was later changed to Ministry of Basic and Senior Secondary Education (MBSSE)
52
Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). However, there is no evidence that these strategies were
addressed in the programme components.
− Targeting people with disability: With the WinS activities, there was a strong intention to ensure
that latrine installation was based on disability needs, with school latrines constructed in accordance
with UNICEF, GoSL agreed standards and designs. The design on special facilities in schools was
developed in cooperation/ conjunction with the DfID-funded WASH programme in Sierra Leone
where disability friendly facilities were being designed for healthcare facilities covered by DfID WASH.
School facilities included ramps, holding bars etc. and designs were very thorough to address both
software and hardware to ensure people living with disabilities were provided with satisfactory
facilities. However, there appears to have been little discussion on how ASWA-SL could promote
specific interventions that addressed disability, for instance through accessible latrine designs in
communities.
− Children: Some of the activities in schools was established with children’s specific needs in mind, e.g.
training of girls and teachers and providing material for girl-friendly menstrual hygiene production.
Also separate girls’ toilets were observed in most school toilets. However, in the ASWA-SL Program
design, girls’ specific needs could have been better addressed. The menstrual hygiene package was
not included in the inception of the programme in schools, and only integrated at later stages of
ASWA-SL.
− Elderly people: There is no evidence in the programme design that needs of the elderly were
integrated in ASWA-SL.
− Marginalized households: The programme targeted two districts with high vulnerability. The
programme implementation models included methods to integrate vulnerability. For instance, the
CLTS model was designed with inclusion at the village level, where a fully sanitized state is achieved
when all households of the village are supported to achieve open defecation free (ODF) status.
Furthermore, the HHWT model built upon research from randomized controlled intervention trials,
which demonstrated that household water treatment and storage contribute towards significant
reduction in water borne diseases, especially among vulnerable populations.
− The needs of marginalized populations, in that they may be more vulnerable and unable or lack the
means to carry out maintenance of facilities was addressed in the design.
The national MDAs engaged in WASH noted that the identification of specific and most important gender
sensitive WASH needs was done through staff based at Local Council offices and also through support
from the UNICEF IPs. The IPs confirmed that they conducted pre-implementation vulnerability
assessments of chiefdoms and communities through participatory engagement with these community
groups, and their reports were shared with the respective councils for review and validation. The
vulnerability analyses aimed at leaving no one behind across gender and vulnerable groups especially
people with a physical disability.
District WASH stakeholders reported that needs assessments and stakeholder consultations at community
level were carried out to identify the specific and most important WASH needs for the different population
categories. The issue of population and distance was discussed to ensure that the facilities were accessible
to vulnerable groups especially women, children and people living with disabilities, as well as poor
households. Beneficiaries were given the opportunity to contribute to the discussions and bring out
suggestions for improving the accessibility of WASH facilities to all categories of people in their respective
communities. UNICEF used a standard questionnaire administered by mapping officers to capture the
needs of the targeted beneficiaries.
53
IPs confirmed that the specific needs of the various target groups were identified mainly through
community consultation, wealth-ranking and transect walks. Generally, the most important need
expressed by all beneficiaries was simply to get access to potable water and sanitation facilities. Other
needs expressed included easy access to WASH facilities in schools for children living with disabilities,
separate sanitation facilities for girls and boys, and comfortable space for menstrual hygiene. For female
headed households, as well as the vulnerable, a need for financial independence was identified. Excerpts
from some IPs: “Contractual agreement clearly requires inclusiveness of all community groups”,
“inclusiveness was factored into all aspects of needs assessment and project implantation”, and
“communities that lacked potable water were prioritized and this caters for water needs of all community
members/ groups”.
Community capacity
No assessments of community capacity were carried out for the initial planning and design of ASWA-SL.
However, the respective roles and responsibilities defined for communities were in line with common
knowledge and strategies in the sector, and community capacity building outputs and activities to fill the
known gaps were included in the programme design. Nonetheless, UNICEF carried out a comprehensive
capacity assessment early in the programme, which informed the detailed planning of programme
activities. The assessment indicated that communities had a low capacity to maintain WASH facilities.
National MDAs confirmed that they as ministries were not directly involved with the assessment of
capacity and conducting capacity-building for communities. These activities were carried out by staff at
district level in collaboration with Local Councils, which is consistent with rural WASH responsibilities of
councils. District WASH stakeholders reported that an assessment of capacities and capacity building
needs of the communities vis-à-vis community-based WASH management and their roles in ASWA
implementation were carried out in the target communities. The measures/ activities that were included
in the program design to address the identified capacity gaps were: Formation of community structures
such as WASH committees to manage the facilities, training of maintenance officers, and training of water
and sanitation managers.
Key findings related to EQ2:
FINDING 2.1: Broadly speaking, ASWA-SL design responded to specific needs of different groups such as
women, men, children, and vulnerable groups such as people living with disabilities and the elderly and
targeting needy communities identified in an assessment process engaging local, district, and national
stakeholders.
FINDING 2.2: At the strategic level, ASWA-SL responded well to the needs of women and children e.g. in
the provision of WASH facilities in safe locations and reducing workload for collecting water.
FINDING 2.3: In terms of project design, targeting women and people living with disabilities was largely
carried out through the WASH in Schools activities, with evidence of specific attention to people living
with disabilities at community/ household level being less convincing and largely as a result of using the
integrated approach – ‘No one left behind’ with limited specific affirmative actions for the vulnerable
groups.
54
9.1.3 EQ3 Relevance – responding to needs.
To what extent did the ASWA program components, outcomes, outputs, activities respond to the
identified needs of the different groups (men, women, girls, boys, persons with disabilities, elderly
people, marginalized households) in an inclusive manner in its design and planning?
ToC and result framework
The Theory of Change (ToC) generally responded to the needs for improvements in WASH services in
schools and communities, but not specifically to the identified needs of the different groups. There is
nothing unusual in this, since the programme was naturally implemented in an integrated manner where
the WASH facilities targeted all groups in the communities and schools. Nonetheless, the ToC specifically
mentioned child-friendly facilities in the strategy and also specified impact on child mortality and
morbidity. The Results Framework (RF) also generally described the activities, outputs, indicators and
targets in the target communities and schools and only mentioned child-friendly facilities and children in
the targets.
The tracking matrix for overall reporting on progress in the implementation of the ASWA Programme did
not include indicators disaggregated into the respective groups. The actual numbers of men, women, girls,
boys, persons with disabilities, elderly people, marginalized households that were reached by the
programme in the respective communities were thus not tracked.
District WASH stakeholders revealed that the programme design included the inclusion of the different
beneficiary groups through consultative meetings. Most communities agreed that there was an equitable
representation of men women and vulnerable groups in various WASH related groups. The IPs also
reported that the School Hygiene Clubs (SHC) comprised of schoolboys and girls from all grades, with at
least two (a boy and a girl) per grade. The SHCs were responsible for ensuring environmental sanitation
of the schools and encourage personal hygiene of all pupils. SHCs reportedly engaged their households
and communities through hygiene and sanitation awareness and campaigns.
Implementation arrangements
The strongest evidence for ASWA-SL’s attention to equity lies in the selection of models during the design
and planning process, which are renown globally for promoting equity and gender inclusion in a general
sense. For example, the CLTS model aims to achieve fully sanitised status with evidence of inclusion. This
model promotes a “no one left behind” approach, where all community members work towards a fully
sanitized status. CLTS was also a good way to include the vulnerable, as certain requirements at village
level had to be met, so community members had to meet each other and help each other.
ASWA-SL was also inspired by the Child Friendly Schooling (CFS) concept promoted by UNICEF globally, as
an initiative specifically focused on ensuring children’s right to quality education is realised. It does this by
providing a comprehensive multi-dimensional definition of quality education, encompassing inclusion;
health, safety, protection; teaching and learning; and community partnership strategies, which
collectively reflect the main dimensions that present barriers to education for children.
The IPs confirmed that the contractual agreements (PCA) clearly required inclusiveness of all community
groups. Inclusiveness was factored into all aspects of needs assessment and project implementation.
Communities that lacked potable water were prioritized and this catered for water needs of all community
members/ groups.
55
Key findings related to EQ3:
FINDING 3.1: Generally, the ASWA-SL programme has responded to specific needs of different groups,
with the strongest evidence in the selection of models used by UNICEF for promoting equity and gender
inclusion. This includes the CLTS model with a “no one left behind” approach to include the vulnerable;
and the Child Friendly Schooling concept.
9.1.4 EQ4 Relevance – Targeting vulnerable and under-served.
To what extent did the program interventions target specific vulnerable and underserved areas of the
country36
WASH access
ASWA-SL targeted vulnerable and underserved districts while also avoiding districts with other substantial
WASH programmes ongoing. The rural areas in Sierra Leone are in general marred by high levels of
vulnerability.37
The level of access to WASH in the respective districts in 2010 and 201738 is illustrated in Figure 9-1. In the
target districts and in Sierra Leone in general, there is very low access to the combined WASH services –
households using basic water and sanitation services and also practicing handwashing with soap and
water. The districts with larger urban populations such as Western Area and Bo, have better access to
WASH.
This supports the ASWA-SL strategy of targeting marginalised and vulnerable rural areas. Koinadugu and
Bonthe districts are among the districts with the lowest levels of access to services. Substantial
improvements were achieved between 2010 and 2017 in the access to water, improved sanitation, and
handwashing in the two districts.

56
Figure 9-1: Access to WASH services in 2010 and 201739
While district level data on poverty and rural water access and sanitation access is very poor, it can be
assumed that underserved areas were selected for ASWA-SL intervention. However, there appears to
have been issues with targeting at sub-district level, especially in Bonthe, where the choice of target
chiefdoms was problematic, according to the 2017 Sustainability Check: “At 54.6% water supply coverage
(WPM:2016), it is unclear how Jong could have been prioritized over Kwamebai Krim (0.21%) or Sittia (3%)
or Dema. The tension has led to lingering challenges with project coordination, in a district where senior
district officials have called for greater accountability”. UNICEF also made efforts to avoid duplication with
other development partners’ programmes, which would have meant that in not all cases the district with
the highest vulnerability score was selected if another programme was active in that district.
The ASWA Baseline Report 2018 provides some analysis of indicators, which includes both the GoSL 2016
Water Point Mapping Exercise and the MICS 2017. Figure 9-2 outlines the key baseline information
presented in the 2018 ASWA Baseline Report in the two targeted districts, demonstrating widespread
poor levels of access. The baseline data on access are further described in relation to the end-line data in
9.2.2 below, demonstrating the low level of access in the target districts as well as the low functionality
of water facilities.
39 based on data from the SSL Multi-Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS 2010 and MICS 2017). The MICS5 is the first time
that comprehensive data have been collected on combined WASH services, so the 2010 figures shown in the graph
are determined from the access to combined water and sanitation combined with data on practicing handwashing.

Poverty levels
The poverty gap index is a measure of severity of poverty in a defined population. In Sierra Leone, GoSL’s
Agenda for Prosperity measures absolute poverty in the districts by incidence, gap and severity and
percentage of the population42. Poverty is most severe in the rural areas, with a severity index of 9.1%
compared to 2.8% in urban areas. Moreover, poverty most severe in the Northern region (where
Koinadugu/ Falaba is located) with a severity index of 8.1%, compared to 7.4% in the Southern region and
7.5% in the Eastern region.
In 2003, Bonthe was the district with the highest incidence and severity of poverty in the Southern region.
Koinadugu, ranked 3rd out of four districts in terms of incidence of poverty, in Northern region and 2nd
highest in terms of severity. Nationally, Bonthe and Koinadugu rated similarly on the poverty severity
index, Bonthe ranked 3rd highest out of 12 districts at 21.1%, while Koinadugu ranked moderately at
17.6%. Hence, while districts selected were not the most severely affected by poverty in absolute terms;
they were still vulnerable areas of the country. Stakeholders confirmed that the two districts selected for
DGIS represent some of the least developed and hardest to reach districts in the country and are generally
marred by poor infrastructure such as roads network and electricity.
Key findings related to EQ4:

9.1.5 EQ5 Relevance – logical and coherent intervention strategy
To what extent was the program intervention strategy for achieving the desired WASH outcomes and
impact outlined in the program document logical and coherent?43
Intervention strategy
A clear description of context and gaps/ needs in the WASH sector guided the intervention strategy. The
programme intervention strategies were informed by a clear analysis of the national sector context and
status of WASH challenges on the Programme Document. The programme focus and strategy were clearly
linked to addressing the challenges identified. The context analysis was backed up by evidence from a
range of different reliable sources, including GoSL Sector Performance Reports and the JMP analysis.
ToC and result framework
A clear strategy linking activities and outputs to the intended results (outcomes and impact) was lacking
in the Theory of Change (ToC) and results framework. The ToC and results framework were not fully
aligned, the outcomes, results and the assumptions outlined in the results framework were inconsistent
with the ToC. The ToC did not indicate outcomes for WASH in schools. Moreover, the ToC’s outcome level
results stated very broad outcomes. The use of terms “outcome” and “output” were interchangeable in
planning documentation – both referred to outcomes.

The ToC did not capture the policy and institutional dimensions that were otherwise well described in the
narrative of the programme document, while the results framework only captured the local institutional

level and not the policy and national level institutions, although these were stated as areas of
engagement.
Health centres/ clinics were mentioned in project document, but not in the ToC, results framework,
activities, or targets. The intended coverage of these is thus unclear. The expected results in the results
framework and narrative were formulated differently and Result 7 (By 2017, the two districts councils of
Bonthe and Koinadugu are strengthened to deliver monitoring and evaluation responsibilities to inform
the sector on sustainability of water and sanitation facilities) was not fully correlated regarding national
level targets and results.
Indicator quality
The output indicators largely correlated to results in the results framework and were mostly SMART45 and
well-designed to capture the relevant data, with a large focus on quantitative data collection. However,
in some cases, the indicators at outcome and impact level were not SMART and undermined by a lack of
clarity surrounding their measurement. Moreover, the indicators were formulated differently in the
original results framework, the ‘Programme Monitoring Tracking Table’ and the progress reporting.
The programme intervention strategy indicated the intended impact of the programme, but the results
framework and monitoring of ASWA-SL did not clearly link to programme impact or track impact. There
were no impact indicators for ASWA-SL.
The targets were largely clearly identified and integrated in the definition of results in results framework,
although not all indicators had corresponding targets. Some targets were revised upwards., but in general,
the original targets were low given the relative size and budget of ASWA-SL. Some examples are given in
Table 9-2 below.

formulations of the indicator in the progress reporting
and the ‘Programme Monitoring Tracking Tables’46
Monitoring of indicators
National WASH stakeholders noted that the ASWA-SL supported the design and development of a national
M&E platform to virtually collate data at district level. However, the platform was not regularly populated
by the districts. District WASH stakeholders confirmed that the monitoring system and tools were
effective for measuring results. The indicators were well defined; for example, ‘100% absence of excreta
in open spaces and the presence of covered latrines that are used by all households’ show that there is
no open defecation in the community. However, stakeholders lamented that UNICEF had stopped funding
monitoring by district stakeholders (e.g. the MWR Engineers and Water Point Mappers) indicating that
there is need for addressing the available resources at district level for monitoring and supporting WASH
in communities by the Government and Development Partners.
The IPs found the indicators well-defined and measurable; but did not have the ability and time to prepare
objective reports. Some relied on informal conversations with beneficiaries and WASH stakeholders. They
stated that the DHMT and the clinics could provide objective health indicators. The IPs did not carry out
surveys of the proportion of girls using menstrual hygiene facilities; but assumed that most girls would be
using the facilities.
Annual reports reported regularly on impact, but in a generalized way. For instance, the 2018 annual
report contains a statement without supportive data: “Although no conclusive impact assessment has
been done so far, the programme is still ongoing until December 2019 and anticipated that it will greatly
contribute to the reduction of diarrheal diseases associated with WASH in Programme areas. However,
this will only be realized if various CLTS community remain motivated to commit to maintain ODF status

62
and commit resources to household sanitation and move up the sanitation ladder. In the long-term, if the
programme outcomes are sustained, then it is envisaged that it will contribute to the reduction in child
mortality and morbidity rates associated with water, sanitation and hygiene.” This statement indicates
the challenges that needed to be addressed for programme impact to occur but provided no concrete
analysis of trends or indication of targets or milestones being achieved.
Assumptions and risks
The assumptions outlined in the ToC and results framework were not actually assumptions but risks – they
did not adequately outline critical sector bottlenecks, nor did they consider what are well-known for
challenges for community-based models for rural water supply and the long-term behavioural changes
required for CLTS.
The sustainability of the CLTS model, as a behaviour change intervention, which creates a social norm
within communities and needs to be sustained beyond the triggering phase was not adequately
considered in the ToC. The assumptions outlined did not adequately capture the complexity of the
required collection actors and simultaneous actions required for the CLTS approach to progress. In both
areas (water and sanitation) the assumptions outlined that leadership was required from GoSL but did not
adequately describe the specific actions required beyond budget allocation and guidance.
Obvious risks that might prevent the change predicted from taking place were not identified. For instance,
poor sustainability is a well-known sector challenge faced in rural water supply schemes that rely on
community-based O&M and cost recovery. That this was also an issue for ASWA-SL is documented in
Appendix 7 Facilities Observations Checklist – Technical Narrative’ describing the challenges related to
functionality of water services.
Key findings related to EQ5:
FINDING 5.1: A clear description of context and gaps/needs within the WASH sector has guided the
intervention strategy. The clarity of the strategy and framework linking activities and outputs to the
intended results (outcomes and impact) in the Theory of Change and results framework are however
lacking.
FINDING 5.2: In terms of the correlation and coverage of indicators vis-à-vis the intended outcomes and
impact, indicators are generally SMART,47 however clarity on the indicator definitions is needed on aspects
such number of persons served per water point and knowledge, attitude and practice aspects to
determine persons covered by awareness raising activities and persons with ‘improved hygiene
behaviours’. The lack of clarity on indicator definitions has resulted in uncertainty of the reported
achievements compared to original targets.
FINDING 5.3: The programme intervention strategy indicates the intended impact of the programme;
however the results framework and monitoring of ASWA-SL does not clearly link to programme impact or
track impact in a measured way.

FINDING 5.4: The assumptions outlined in the Theory of Change and results framework do not adequately
outline critical sector bottlenecks, nor do they resolve the present challenges that are well known and
faced during community-based models for rural water supply and the long term behaviour change
required for CLTS.
9.1.6 EQ6 Relevance – management roles and responsibilities
To what extent were program management arrangements and the distribution of roles and
responsibilities among implementing partners clear, and aligned with their mandates and capacities?48
Roles and mandates
The roles and responsibilities for programme management arrangements and the lines of communication
with partners were clearly defined. Within UNICEF, the WASH Manager managed the day-to-day
implementation and worked on two levels with partners: through GoSL counterparts, and through
counterparts at the district level.
At the national level, the WASH Manager’s direct counterparts were the Director of Planning in
consultation with the Chief Education Officer at MEST (now MBSSE), the Director of Environmental
Sanitation and public Health in consultation with Deputy Chief Medical Officer at MoHS, and the Director
of Water Resources in consultation with the Permanent Secretary at MEWR (now MoWR).
Counterparts at the district level included District Councils’ development planners and WASH officers,
DHMT members, District Directorates of Education, and MWR Engineers stationed in districts. These joint
district teams were responsible for coordinating, monitoring, and supervising ASWA-SL interventions,
including organising monthly coordination meetings and quarterly monitoring of IP implementation. At
the community level, ASWA-SL had a range of partners including: WASH Committees, sanitation
facilitators, trainers, master trainers, CLTS leaders and hygiene promoters; for water supply and water
user groups: (WUGs), hand-pump mechanics, manual drilling company staff; for WinS: SMC, education
supervisors; and for monitoring the NGO staff. The IPs also confirm that the DDE team also assist in
facilitation of the School Hygiene Clubs. Most FGDs affirmed the engagement of community leaders and
women’s group and the establishment of WASH committees.
Partner roles were well-defined and built upon existing community structures to avoid duplication. At the
community level, groups were established with clear roles, and guidelines on how to operate, including
in relation to other community groups. An example is the collaboration with community health workers.
Sierra Leone has a community health workers’ system, from the national level to communities that
operates to identify sanitation/ public health issues and communicate problems including disease
outbreaks, and ASWA-SL activities were established with clear lines of communication towards
community members and from the health workers to the districts.
48 Sources of evidence: KII, ASWA Programme Document
64
The arrangements were made based on results from pre-feasibility assessments (conducted by partners,
together with UNICEF and communities), which assessed community structures including the chiefdom
representatives, district councils, DHMT, and schools.
The nature and type of roles assigned were aligned and consistent with the mandates of the IPs and they
had the capacity to fully carry out their roles. Communities confirmed their involvement in the
implementation of the projects in terms of labour, monitoring, and providing local building materials, such
as stones, sand, and sticks and advice based on their indigenous knowledge for the implementation. The
communities were also responsible for safe storage of the construction materials. The community
members reported that they only contributed money to support cooking of food for the contractors’
technicians. The community leaders found their roles were to advice, monitor and liaise with the
community and the implementing partners on issues surrounding the project management at the local-
level. The youth groups were responsible for cleaning and providing labour, e.g. for digging and other
manual work.
Youths suggested better arrangements, such as signing of contracts between implementing partners and
the communities including paying for their labour as recommendation for future projects. Women and
pupils recommended building more facilities, while community leaders recommended hiring semi-skilled
community members to be part of future projects instead of only asking communities to offer free
support. These responses could be taken as a reflection of the situation in rural communities with few
opportunities for paid jobs and not necessarily as a critic or demand for future project implementation.
The responses are an indication of the need for extensive consultations and discussion with all groups on
the implementation roles prior to implementation to avoid dissatisfaction.
The SMC reportedly had similar responsibilities for the school WASH activities, except that they relied on
community stakeholders to support the provision of unskilled labour and accommodate the technicians.
In some cases, SMCs excluded schoolteachers from the implementation due to alleged corrupt practices
with respect to storage of the construction materials.
The IPs confirmed the community responsibilities and added that the communities also accommodated
IPs’ technicians in residences of households, were custodians of project materials, monitored day-to-day
implementation activities, and ensured sustainability of facilities after completion. National WASH
stakeholders confirmed the community responsibilities and that the communities were also facilitated to
lead CLTS interventions.
There had been no discussions on disagreements of roles between implementing partners and community
members. Communities in Bonthe confirmed that their roles were clear and appropriate.
The district joint implementation teams were responsible for monitoring IP implementation. Monthly
meetings were held at the district coordination meetings to review the implementation progress and set
new targets. District WASH stakeholders participated in the assessment of targets, coordinated WASH
monthly meetings, conducted joint monitoring and supervision visits with MDAs, facilitated training of
pump and solar mechanics and CLTS masons, and certified facilities upon completion.
Representation in decision-making
The key ministries of MWR, MoHS and MBSSE participated in ASWA-SL decision making in the steering
committee. However, the participation of cross-cutting MDAs such as MLGRD, MGCA, and NCPD did not
65
fully participate. These MDAs should be fully involved in the overall strategic planning of WASH
interventions in the district and in the communities; and the MLGRD should be involved in the
implementation to ensure good coordination with the role of Districts in WASH implementation.
The DHMT, District councils, MWR District staff and IPs participated in regular coordination meetings with
WASH actors, which were held regularly to discuss implementation and funding mechanisms, and
coordinate the intervention areas of different WASH actors, to avoid duplication of effort. Reportedly, all
stakeholders were represented in the WASH coordination meetings.
In terms of implementation, School Management Committees (SMC) reportedly comprised 70% men and
30% women, which KIIs and FGDs found were due to the low availability of female teachers. The SMCs
were responsible for the day-to-day running of programme implementation and were custodians of
implementation materials as well as ensuring the continuous functioning of the school WASH facilities.
Community WASH Committees mainly comprise equitable representation i.e. about 50% men and 50%
women and in some case more women than men. The committee also has same responsibilities of keeping
the water point clean, formulation of bylaws with respect to the use of the facility and raising funds for
repairs and maintenance.
Village Savings and Loans Associations (VSLA) generally had 80% female and 20% male membership.
Reportedly, female-headed households, ultra-poor and adults living with disabilities formed the core of
membership. VSLAs had the objective of enhancing income generation and welfare including contribution
to community activities such as WASH.
Key findings related to EQ6:
FINDING 6.1: ASWA-SL had a clear division of the roles and responsibilities for programme management
arrangements, and lines of communication with partners were clear. Programme management
arrangements at community, district and national level were generally clear.

Due to the Ebola pandemic, some target locations were changed in accordance with GoSL’s shifted
strategies. In 2017, the GoSL brought together development partners to outline post-Ebola Presidential
Delivery Priorities, which were delivered through a Secretariat in charge of identifying beneficiaries and
their locations. This had major bearings on ASWA-SL and the remaining locations within the two target
districts. ASWA-SL’s partners at the district revised their targeting according to GoSL’s plan. KIIs and FGDs
have shown that when possible, UNICEF was thorough with the identification of beneficiaries through a
strong partnership and coordination with the target District Councils. UNICEF supported District Councils
with funds to conduct district level joint monitoring of the implementation activities carried out by the IPs
for progress and quality control.
District WASH stakeholders confirmed that communities were selected through consultations with the
chiefdom stakeholders. UNICEF had its own criteria for selecting communities based on vulnerability
assessment of the target communities and targeting the underserved in the area/ chiefdom in close

67
consultation with the district. Communities with WASH facilities supported by other organisations were
excluded in order to avoid duplication. The IPs reported that all target locations were reached, including
hard-to-reach areas.
Groups reached compared to targets.
ASWA-SL partners engaged entire communities rather than specific segments within the communities, in
part due to the models selected (i.e. CLTS is based on a total community approach).
Some challenges were reported in relation to covering all WASH components in the communities; all
targeted communities were reached with sanitation and hygiene promotion interventions, but a few
communities were not reached with water supply due to poor availability of ground- or surface water as
well as time and funding constraints. The facilities observation revealed that in a number of communities,
the water points were not adequate for the population or seasonal resulting in obvious hygiene problems
due to lack of easy access to potable water.
Strategies were adjusted midway through implementation to address these challenges, e.g. by drilling
deeper, solar motorized boreholes with larger reticulated gravity schemes, especially in Koinadugu and
Falaba, which naturally benefit from rolling hills and mountainous terrain to serve schools, healthcare
facilities and communities in close proximity to each other from one source, as opposed to only
constructing individual hand dug wells.
Considerable effort was made to reach all vulnerable groups, especially with the design and deployment
of disability-friendly WASH facilities in schools. However, one IP reported some challenges in reaching
people living with physical disabilities not having the means of mobility to attend community sensitization
sessions. This was also mentioned by the commission of people living with disability that most of the rural
people living with disabilities are heavily constrained and depending on assistance from relatives for
mobility.
District WASH stakeholders confirmed that vulnerable groups in the target communities were reached.
However, in Fullah communities in Koinadugu/ Falaba, women were not allowed to take leadership roles
in WASH committees for religious reason as Fullah communities are dominantly Muslims. The IPs noted
that all vulnerable groups were reached in the target communities as part of their commitment to ensure
no-one is left behind in their WASH interventions.
Community groups in Koinadugu/ Falaba districts confirmed that ASWA-SL, especially the water facilities,
reached every member of the community and that the facilities are in locations easily accessible for all.
The main obstacle, to accessing the water facilities is the inability of some members to pay monthly
contributions in some communities for the maintenance of water points.
Some of the community leaders and youth in Bonthe district expressed concern that the project did not
reach everybody, including the elderly and people living with disabilities because the facilities were built
at a distance and heights that some could not access easily.
There is some evidence that overarching strategies that addressed the needs of women and children were
utilized in day-to-day programme implementation. Partners at the district level, e.g. Akvo, included
reporting on parameters capturing whether special needs were addressed at the community level,
including among the beneficiaries the proportion of people living with disabilities, youth, and children.
68
Key findings related to EQ7:
FINDING 7.1: The targeted geographical areas and targeted groups were generally reached, but reaching
people living with disabilities was challenging due to location and design of facilities.
9.2.2 EQ8 Effectiveness – achievement of results
To what extent have the expected results of the program been achieved?
Achievement of targets
ASWA-SL reported that all targets were reached in excess of initial targets. Targets in the PD were adjusted
upwards in Annual Reports and monitoring tools were adjusted upwards at different stages of programme
implementation, while budget was adjusted downwards during the course of implementation (see Table
9-5 in the Efficiency Section). Table 9-4 shows the targets at design, the revised targets, and the final
reporting on achievements of the programme.
The targets were set and reported in terms of persons served, but not disaggregated to gender or age and
groups in the community.

Joint Sector Reviews organized results reported.
Based on the data from the evaluation team’s field observations some activities were not completed, e.g.
two of the communities in Koinadugu district reported that all planned activities were completed while in
two others, the expected projects were far from being completed. For the sanitation activities, this seems
to indicate that the CLTS approach was not effectively disseminated since the ‘programme’ is not
constructing toilets, but the households were expected to build their own latrines or have arrangements
with neighbours for the use of a latrine. The access to toilets facilities was seen in many communities as
being inadequate, most households sharing facilities and not being comfortable for visitors to inspect their
facilities.
Equal access to water facilities was provided to all the communities, although of different levels of access
in the respective communities, with a high number of persons sharing water points in some communities.
Likewise, community leaders and youth in Bonthe district expressed that the planned activities in their
community were not completed on time and did not entirely fulfil their expectations. The evaluation
team’s field work indicates that approximately 70% of the communities have access to water supply, but
not adequately so. For sanitation, some reported that they only had access through the facilities built at
the school. Demand for sanitation and hygiene were created through the CLTS approach. Despite the fact,
households built toilets, but handwashing facilities were missing during the field visit, however, except
for those provided by Village Savings and Loan Association (VSLA) members in the fight against COVID-19.

Figure 9-4: ASWA-SL targets and achievements
The tracking tables presents impressive achievements
in terms of number of persons covered, exceeding all
targets. The definition of the indicators to measure the
achievements are important and the evaluation team
found that the headings in the Tracking Tables needed
clarification. For example:
- The tracking table reports on result area 1 ‘People
with sustainable access to improved water’:
consultations with UNICEF indicated that this includes all the water sources constructed or
rehabilitated by ASWA-SL and functioning at the time of completion. The field observations indicate
that this includes some that are seasonal and/or not-functioning64.
- The tracking table reports on result area 2 ‘people with sustainable access to basic sanitation‘:
Consultations with UNICEF indicate that the reported achievements are the population that have
access to improved sanitation facilities. The target for new users of (improved) basic sanitation
facilities is the same as the target for result area 4 ‘hygiene education and sanitation promotion’ and
the achievement for result area 2 of 604,606 people is higher than the population reached by result
area 4, the promotion campaigns of 473,441 people. The reported achievement of access for more
than 600,000 persons is very high compared to the total population in the target districts of 675,000
people. The Evaluation Team did not have access to data verifying that the persons reported actually
have sustainable access to sanitation.
- The tracking table reports on result area 4 on ‘Hygiene Education and Sanitation Promotion’: the
targets and reported achievements are the same for ‘People with improved hygiene behaviours’ and
‘People with knowledge of improved hygiene behaviours’. The population reported seems to be the
persons reached by the hygiene promotion activities and campaigns, however knowledge does not
necessarily result in changed hygiene practices. UNICEF has also clarified that the number for
improved hygiene behaviour include direct beneficiaries (those involved in direct hygiene promotion
activities and monitoring behaviour change) and indirect beneficiaries (a small proportion of those
reached through hygiene promotion campaigns).
Water in communities
The field observations of facilities and consultations with communities revealed some shortcomings in the
functionality of a number of completed wells and piped water systems, with some design issues that
prevent systems from delivering water as expected, e.g. water not being available during dry seasons. It
was also observed that a high number of persons were reported served by some water installations. For
example, one hand dug well in Bonthe serves a community of 437 persons which is far above the national
standards of an average of 250 persons per installation, and well above the expected yield of the
installation. These observations are described in detail in ‘Appendix 7 Facilities Observations Checklist –
Technical Narrative’.
64 While the non-functionality is related to a specific date of data collection it is a general indication of reduced access
to safe water.
72
The challenges with seasonality of hand dug wells and the general functionality of the water installations
indicate that the reported number of persons served by the water installations is higher than the actual
persons getting water from the ASWA installations.
In the case of seasonal wells or other water supplies their inclusion in the progress reporting implies that
this community has now been provided with at least a basic service level, but a basic service level requires
that the service be provided at all times, i.e. for 12 months of the year. If there are periods when the
community can no longer get water from the protected source they will have to resort to unprotected or
surface sources with a consequent increase in health risks and time spent collecting water. For facilities
which are repairable by the community using their own resources, non-functionality is not an issue which
should affect reporting, but where the water supply is partly functional or non-functional due to a design
or construction defect, it seems incorrect to include these localities in the progress report as having been
provided with a basic service.
The IPs and the District WASH teams (in particular the MWR water point mappers stationed at district
level) seems not to have utilised the Water Point Mapping65 tools to record the completed installations
although these were developed by the MWR in collaboration with support from UNICEF.
The total number of persons in the ASWA-SL target communities reported as having been covered with
access to water services is 173,220 persons66 which is similar to the number of persons reported to have
been provided with access to water services through the ASWA-SL67. This corresponds to 82% of the
population in the target communities.
The results from the baseline and end-line household survey on the SDG WASH indicators for access to
water are shown in Figure 9-5.
65 Latest entry on https://washdata-sl.org/water-point-data/ seems to be in October 2016 when the general WPM
Update was conducted as part of the national SDG WASH Baseline survey
66 UNICEF: Programme Monitoring Tracking Table 30 May 2020
67 With the available data, it was not possible for the evaluation team to estimate the number of persons covered
by the ASWA-SL program with different standards of WASH services since i) in Bonthe district population figures are
not available for most of the CEDA solar borehole systems. There are also an unknown number of WVI solar borehole
systems; and ii) for statistical reasons it is not possible to reliably estimate the numbers of functional water systems
or their service levels from the samples inspected, this is explained in more detail in the section on sampling.
73
Figure 9-5:Baseline and end-line statistics on access to water
This shows substantial improvements
in the levels of basic and safely
managed service from 30% in 2016 to
56% in 2020. However, these figures
are for the wet season situation and the
reader is referred to the annex on data
analyses section 15 which shows sharp
decreases in levels of service in the dry
season.
It is also seen that the proportion of
users obtaining drinking water from
surface sources has fallen substantially
from 38.6% in 2016 to 13.8% in 2020.
The analysis in section 15 of the annex
shows that this improvement is carried
over to the dry season. In 2016 most users affected by the seasonality of their water sources used surface
water as an alternative. In 2020 most users affected by seasonality were instead obtaining water from
unimproved sources, which are safer than most surface sources.
Sanitation in communities
The results from baseline and end-line household surveys on the SDG WASH sanitation service ladders
showing the proportion of the population in the ASWA target communities using the respective standards
of sanitation access are shown in Figure 9-6.
The reduction of more than 20% in the population without access to any sanitation is a good achievement
of ASWA-SL as it clearly reduces open defecation.
The high proportion of persons using unimproved latrines of almost 56% is in line with the success of the
CLTS process of households constructing the type of toilets they can afford. The population using limited
sanitation68 is also in line with the CLTS approach encouraging households to use neighbours’ toilets if the
household does not have its own.
56.9% of the households responding to the end-line survey reported safe disposal of children’s stool.
There was an increase in the number of households in the Bonthe district who reported safe disposal of
children’s stools from 53.4% at baseline to 57.1% in the end-line survey. However, there was a decrease
in Koinadugu from 68% to 56.7%.
68 the SDG WASH indicator for limited sanitation is using an improved facility but shared with other households.
74
Figure 9-6: Baseline and end-line statistics on access to sanitation
The proportion of the population
practicing open defecation at district
level69 in the two target districts in 2017
was 23.6% compared to 25.2% in 2016.
The responses to the end-line survey
indicate that approximately 41% of the
households were of the opinion that
their communities have been declared
ODF. In Bonthe, 24.7% reported that
their communities have been declared
ODF compared to 64.8% of the
households in Koinadugu.
Handwashing in communities
The end-line survey indicates that there
is an increase from 10.7% to 13.2% in
the households having handwashing
facilities with soap and water in the ASWA-SL communities. In Bonthe, 11.2% and in Koinadugu/ Falaba,
16.9% of the households have handwashing facilities with soap and water on the premises. This is a very
small increase in Bonthe70 from 10.1% and a larger increase from 11.4% in Koinadugu/ Falaba during the
baseline survey. The baseline and end-line surveys results are illustrated on Figure 9-7.
Figure 9-7: Handwashing baseline vs end-line
Contradictory to the relatively low level
of handwashing facilities, about 59%
(54.3% in Bonthe and 65.9% in
Koinadugu/ Falaba) of households
interviewed in the end-line survey
responded that they wash their hands
with soap after defecation. This is an
increase from the baseline where about
45% in the two districts responded that
they wash their hands with soap after
defecation.
These results indicate some success of
the hygiene education as generally it seems that people are well aware that they ought to wash hands
while actual practices might be lacking behind. Effective handwashing will also be limited by the easy
access to water in many communities since hand washing is unlikely to be sustained in the absence of an
adequate, convenient, and reliable supply of water.
69 2017 figures from MISC6 and 2016 figures from population census
70 The surprising results from Bonthe might be influenced by the baseline being district level data and the end-line
focussing on the ASWA-SL target communities.
75
Household water treatment
ASWA-SL promoted household water treatment methods to improve the quality of drinking water used
in the households. The baseline and end-line survey collected information on the use of water treatment
methods in the communities and the results are illustrated on Figure 9-8.
Figure 9-8: Household water treatment
The use of chlorine and bleach seem to
have decreased in the ASWA target
communities while the proportion of
households responding that they strain
the water or let it stand and settle have
increased substantially in the target
communities.
Solar disinfection has been introduced
but is used by a very small proportion
of the households while the boiling of
water and use of water filters have also
increased, while remaining a small
proportion of the treatment methods
used.
Figure 9-9: Map showing household level drinking water quality in Bonthe district.
The effectiveness of
removing contaminates
from the drinking water by
simply straining or letting
it stand and settle might
be limited.
This is in particular an
issue in view of the serious
water quality issues that
persists in rural systems in
Sierra Leone as illustrated
on Figure 9-9 showing the
household level water
quality map for Bonthe
district71.

water quality in 2019. An example of underutilised tools available to the WASH MDA and UNICEF.
76
Combined WASH in communities
Figure 9-10; Access to combined WASH services.
Health benefits from WASH
investments are more likely when
households have combined access to
basic water and sanitation services
together with hand-washing facilities
and soap.
For the first time, in 2016, MICS
collected data on the combined access
to WASH (basic water and sanitation,
handwashing and soap) in households
in Sierra Leone. The data indicated a
very low combined access of about 2%
in rural areas. This is confirmed by the
end-line survey data as presented in
Figure 9-10 showing the proportion of households (1.4%) that have both basic water and sanitation (WAS)
and the proportion of households (0.1%) that have access to all three components of WASH.
WASH in Schools
The results of the end-line data collection and the facilities observations in schools that were targeted by
ASWA-SL are illustrated on Figure 9-11.
Figure 9-11: Access to WASH in schools
The results shown for ‘water’ is the
proportion of the surveyed schools
that had water services in accordance
with the MBSSE standards. The main
reason some schools do not have
services is functionality and
seasonality.
The results shown for ‘sanitation’ are
the proportion of the surveyed
schools that have sanitation services
according to the MBSSE standards for
toilets (privacy, separation, number
of cubicles etc.).
77
All schools had provision for handwashing in the form of buckets and most provided soap, but the
effectiveness of these measures is closely linked to the water supply and less effective where the water
supply does not meet standards72.
The last group of results shown on Figure 9-11 for ‘W&S’ are the proportion of the surveyed schools that
have access to both water and sanitation according to national standards. Only 40% of the surveyed
schools fulfil this.
Beneficiary views on benefits
In Koinadugu and Falaba districts, easy access to water and improved sanitation are seen as the main
benefits derived by communities from ASWA-SL. While some communities said they were happy with the
facilities provided, all requested for more, especially toilets. The time spent on fetching water was reduced
significantly. Similarly, in Bonthe district, the community leaders and youth experienced significant
benefits in terms of easy access to drinking water. Community leaders were very pleased with the results
and wanted continuation of ASWA-SL.
Community leaders and youth groups both expressed that ASWA-SL provided significant improvements.
Open defecation had ended, and they wash their hands frequently after domestic activities, and they now
have easy access to facilities, and nobody have to fetch water from streams. For the wealthy and poor
people, there is now no difference as both have access to water and sanitation. Some of the toilet’s
facilities built are accessible for people living with disabilities.
Enabling Environment – policies, plans, strategies, and guidelines
To support the enabling environment, ASWA-SL intended to ensure that ministries and government
agencies at all levels could successfully undertake their roles and responsibilities, which in turn would
contribute to strengthening sector capacity and achieving programme results (Result 5).
National Capacity Building: KIIs have indicated that UNICEF has not accurately reported on how ASWA-SL
contributed to national sector capacity building activities under Result 5 (Enabling Environment) and not
indicated the level of collaboration with sector partners. For instance, ASWA-SL annual reports state that
ASWA-SL supported GoSL in facilitating a national WASH sector conference where the national political
leadership was represented. KIIs with sector stakeholders indicate that the UNICEF WASH Programme’s
professional/ technical contribution to the sector conference was jointly done with other donors, and that
UNICEF’s contribution was minor. Another example is that ASWA-SL reporting stated that ASWA-SL
supported the development of the national Urban WASH Policy (2019), while stakeholders indicate that
UNICEF’s involvement was limited in an extensive process. This might be due to the fact ASWA-SL focused
on rural interventions.
Coordination: In terms of sector coordination, ASWA-SL worked in collaboration with GoSL to support a
national WASH sector platform which brings together all sectors partners and donors on a monthly and
quarterly basis to review the sector progress and discuss policy issues. Stakeholders have a mixed
assessment of the coordination platform, with one interviewee stating that early in ASWA-SL coordination
72 See ‘Appendix 7 Facilities Observations Checklist – Technical Narrative’ for details of water supply in schools.
78
was effective, but deteriorated in the later stages of implementation, and that the Steering Committee
was not functional.
The national level WASH sector coordination by nature has to be government-led, and low priority given
to effective sector coordination by GoSL was not an issue that ASWA-SL could address on its own. It must,
however, be recognised that the manner in which UNICEF and other donors and non-governmental
development partners retain full control over the resources for programme implementation with limited
room for decision-making by the WASH MDAs could be a demotivating factor for the WASH MDA
professionals to participate, which in turn reduces the effectiveness of the GoSL led coordination.
Nonetheless, some results were achieved by UNICEF WASH and ASWA-SL vis-à-vis creating an enabling
environment, which are seen to be a success by the KII respondents at national level.
National Monitoring : One area is an improved emphasis on rural WASH monitoring, which was seen to
be largely absent previously. There is a broad recognition that sector monitoring now pays more attention
to disaggregating data by groups, gender, age, etc. and is able to identify specific aspects of WASH access
(e.g. where water contamination occurs), however,, a national, sector-wide monitoring system that
demonstrates progress in all districts has yet to be established.
ASWA-SL demonstrated the need for national monitoring and how such a system can function. However,
it must be recognised that there are many challenges in operationalising the national M&E system and
that the establishment of the monitoring tools is the easy part, whereas the continued data collection and
integration of the data collection tools in the daily work of WASH partners in districts and the private
sector to use the systems is the difficult part.
As mentioned in Chapter 9.2.1, well-established tools like the water point mapping were not used
consistently to record the data and functionality of water facilities implemented with support from ASWA-
SL, whereas this could have been a good opportunity to illustrate the use of the monitoring tools to WASH
stakeholders in Sierra Leone by ensuring that data on all facilities implemented by ASWA-SL were collected
and made available in the M&E Systems. ASWA also facilitated the WASH platform and inter-collaboration
with WASH MDAs (MWR, MHS, MBSSE), however their active functionality remains a challenge.
Key findings related to EQ8:
FINDING 8.1: ASWA-SL reporting indicates that all targets have been reached, in excess of initial targets,
however an adjustment in targets suggest an initial under-targeting. Initial target setting appears to have
under-estimated populations that could be reached.
FINDING 8.2: Targets were met or exceeded, although the field data collected indicates lower
achievements compared to UNICEF progress reporting, to some extent related to unclear definitions of
programme indicators.
FINDING 8.3: There were challenges with seasonality of hand dug wells and piped gravity systems using
surface water sources and with the functionality of the water installations generally, pointing to
possibilities for improving the technical capacities for designing and implementing gravity water facilities
and for supervision and inspection.
79
FINDING 8.4: Some communities were not adequately served by the facilities constructed according to
national standards, e.g. 250 persons served per water point. The combined access to all three WASH
components remains low in the ASWA target districts and in Sierra Leone generally. However, it is to be
noted that the programme was not specifically designed to monitor and report against these specific
standards.
FINDING 8.5: ASWA-SL’s contribution to the national WASH governance framework and capacities is
appreciated by stakeholders, in particular in relation to the sector M&E and the close collaboration with
Districts and sub-national MDAs. However the attribution of ASWA-SL to national sector capacity building
activities is not clear and reporting does not indicate level of collaboration with sector partners.
9.2.3 EQ9 Effectiveness – WASH awareness and practices
To what extent have WASH awareness and practices improved?
Adopting safe hygiene practices
Overall, widespread improved awareness practices in programme locations were identified as a strength
of ASWA-SL. Partners and ASWA-SL monitoring generally indicated that the proportion of beneficiaries
who adopted safe hygiene practices including handwashing at critical times and the use and upkeep of
toilets increased compared to baseline. This was confirmed by community leaders and teachers, as
illustrated by these quotes: “Before our intervention people in the community use to put their cloths and
plates on the floor, but after our intervention every household have a cloth lines, plate rags etc.” and “It
(sensitization) was not sustainable at the initial stage. But second phase was far better. Lot of positives
change with regards WASH awareness and hygiene practices in the school”.
Implementing partners worked continuously on awareness activities in collaboration with community
members (WASH Committees, community health workers, schools health clubs).
As shown in section 9.1.2, the end-line survey revealed some improvements in hygiene practices, such as
59% of the respondents informed that they wash hands with soap after toilet use.
Communities in Koinadugu/ Falaba Districts said there had been a change in hygiene behaviour compared
to before the project, highlighting regular handwashing, water tanks for toilets in schools, monthly general
cleaning, and the framing of new bylaws on sanitation. In Bonthe district, community leaders and youth
reiterated that hygiene behaviour had improved in communities and schools; open defecation had
stopped, hands were washed frequently after visiting toilet, laundry was hung on the sticks instead of laid
the ground for drying.
IPs noted that a one-year sensitisation of community was necessary but not sufficient to change age-old
behaviours. It needs a sustained effort at the community-level over longer time.
Perceived benefits of changes in hygiene practices
The FGD in Koinadugu and Falaba revealed that the changes in hygiene behaviours were considered
important and needful to continue because they were considered as beneficial in preventing communities
from a number of diseases. This was reiterated by the community leaders and women in Bonthe district
80
that expressed that hygiene practices have improved because diarrhoea and other related water borne
diseases have reduced drastically in the communities.
Menstrual hygiene practices
Menstrual hygiene sensitization done in schools was seen to be a successful contribution ASWA-SL; such
sensitization had not been done previously. Pupils, head teachers and female teachers in Koinadugu and
Falaba confirmed students’ awareness of the importance of menstrual hygiene and the practice of good
hygiene practices by pupils who had started menstruation both in school and elsewhere, and that nearly
all female students at the menstrual age practiced good menstrual hygiene. One teacher in Bonthe stated
that:
“There is also an increase of school enrolment for the girl child because a separate room for menstrual
hygiene and we also train them how to fabricate menstrual pads. In all these efforts the female teachers
in the school are part of the training process.”.
Youths affirmed that female students are generally aware of the importance of menstrual hygiene
practices and the responses from the FGD indicate that about 85% practice good menstrual hygiene.
Key findings related to EQ9:
FINDING 9-1: Improved awareness practices in programme locations have been identified as a strength of
ASWA-SL.
FINDING 9.2 : Menstrual hygiene management sensitization done through school activities, was seen to
be a successful area of ASWA-SL as this is an area without previous sensitization activities.
FINDING 9.3: Community members commenting on inadequate numbers of household sanitation facilities
indicate challenges in the introduction of CLTS principles at community level and the understanding of
these since the CLTS process is encouraging community-members to construct household latrines.
FINDING 9.4: A high level of awareness of hygiene practices was achieved through hygiene education in
schools and communities as well as the support to the establishment of WASH Committees, VLSAs, and
SHCs. However, the field observations indicate that this has not resulted in a similar high level of actual
practice of hygiene and handwashing.
9.2.4 EQ10 Effectiveness – O&M Systems
To what extent has functional systems for operation and management of WASH facilities been put in
place?
Functionality
Water Supply: The observations of water in communities found that six out of nine water points and
water systems in Bonthe, none out of three in Falaba and two out of seven in Koinadugu were functional
as they were still under construction at the time. UNICEF reported that these will be completed in June
2021. (see Appendix 7, WinS observation checklists A1-A5).
81
Of the 11/21 non-functioning water points it is possible that in some cases this was due to breakdowns
which should be the responsibility of the community to repair. A determination of the cause of the
breakdown was beyond the scope of the observation checklists but in 10 of the 11 cases there were
obvious sustainability and serious long term issues related to the design and construction such as
seasonality and, water quality, or capacity. In the case of the water point at Gbahama in Bonthe district,
it was simply that the water point had never worked since it was completed. UNICEF, however reported
that this facility was not included in the final report.
Similar results were found for school water supplies: six out of nine in Bonthe, one out of two in Falaba
and none out of two in Koinadugu were functional (see Appendix 7 WinS observation checklists C1-C4).
The same comments as made for WINC also apply to WINS facilities where 7/13 were non -functional and
6 of these facilities are also had serious long-term issues such as seasonality.
Overall for all the water points and water systems inspected during the 2020 survey only 16/32 (50%)
were functioning. The small sample size means we cannot say with confidence that 50% of all ASWA water
supplies are therefore non-functional, the actual situation may be better or worse than this, but it does
indicate the need to investigate and determine the true extent of the problem and the extent to which
seasonality and construction issues are the cause.
WASH Committees exist and are operational in the communities consulted Koinadugu and Falaba, and in
charge of, and collecting funds for, managing, operating, and maintaining water points. Monthly
contributions are generally done on a flat rate for every member of the community. Minor repairs are
done by the WASH Committees and when faults are very serious, experts in water points maintenance
were hired. Two out of the four communities said they have people who were trained on hand pump
repairs.
Community leaders in Bonthe confirmed that normally a member of the WASH Committee is responsible
for water point maintenance. However, a few youth groups said that they did not know who was
responsible for maintaining the water points. Approximately 45% of the community leaders confirmed
that their community had a system of management and operation but no systems for maintenance and
financial management.
The observation checklists showed that in all districts the preferred method for paying for repairs was by
collecting funds, when needed for a repair, by making a collection from households. Some localities did
make monthly collections from households and in 2 cases fines for breaking byelaws were added to the
repair fund.
Communities complained that while some infrastructure was of good quality other facilities were of poor
quality, such as some household toilets that did not even last a year and frequent breakdowns of hand
pumps. Maintenance and repair of facilities were the role of WASH Committees. According to community
leaders, a good number of the facilities are broken down. Several maintenance efforts have been done
but the facilities were still not working.
Sanitation Facilities: The observations of school sanitation facilities found that 11 out of 13 facilities
visited in Bonthe, all four in Falaba, and all four in Koinadugu were functional, i.e. an overall 90%
functionality (see Appendix 7 WinS observation checklist D2).
82
In the communities consulted in Koinadugu and Falaba districts, women have the main responsibility for
maintaining the household sanitation facilities. Community leaderships reported that they implement
bylaws as a way of ensuring good hygiene practices in the communities. In the schools, sanitation facility
maintenance is a shared responsibility between boys and girls across different classes. At one school it
was reported that pupils arriving late at school were required to carry out latrine cleaning duties.
Community leaders in Bonthe reported people were assigned to maintain the sanitation and the washing
facilities, while youth groups said that those people who are closer to the facilities are responsible.
Community leaders said that they will continue with the awareness raising in the community after the
end of ASWA-SL. 15% of the youth groups indicated that they would continue to survey the communities
and report people who are not maintaining the facilities.
School Management Committees: The end-line survey found that 95% of the SMC for WASH are
functional, 92% of the schools in Bonthe and all schools in Koinadugu reported that all their SMCs are
functional and active. However, SMCs are not fully fulfilling their roles with regards to the WASH facilities
as some schools reported breakdown of water facilities with SMCs not doing enough to ensure repairs
were carried out. In Bonthe SMCs expressed that they are monitoring and supervising the WASH facilities
and ensuring that they are in good condition. The SMCs typically meet twice annually.
School Health Clubs: The end-line survey with head teachers indicated that functional SHCs exist in 83%
of the targeted schools (75% in Bonthe and 100% in Koinadugu).
WASH Committees: Three of four communities consulted in Koinadugu and Falaba have a WASH
Committee according to community leaderships and women. However, three of the four youth groups
were unaware of the existence of WASH Committees in their communities but did know individuals
responsible for looking after the water points. WASH Committees are largely perceived as fulfilling their
roles.
Village Savings and Loan Groups (VSLAs): Functioning VSLAs were in place and well-functioning in all the
communities consulted. While the VSLAs are considered very important and useful in improving the
livelihoods of members, respondents said presently the individual members pay for latrines construction
and water points maintenance, and loans from the VSLA are presently not common for WASH activities.
Cost recovery
None of the communities visited for the observation of facilities produced records of income and
expenditure, but several communities had been able to raise funds and arrange for repairs of hand pumps
and replacement of taps without outside financial help and this is an indicator of the viability of
community O&M. Six out of nine communities in Bonthe, one out of two in Falaba, four out of five in
Koinadugu carried out repairs or improvements at their own expense (see Appendix 7 WinS observation
checklists A1-A5). One locality with a solar borehole piped water supply had been able to collect funds
and pay for an extension of the distribution system to a nearby health facility.
In Koinadugu, community members, especially women, pay monthly contributions to WASH Committees
for the maintenance of water points. In two of the communities visited, the contribution is a flat rate per
individual (mostly women) and not per household. In the other communities, a flat rate per household
was applied. Community members are required to make extra contributions in the event that what the
WASH Committees cannot afford spare parts from the monthly contributions. In Bonthe, community
83
leaders and youth groups indicated that no payments are made when collecting water and they contribute
based on their personal saving when funding for specific repairs are needed. Funds collected are kept in
cash boxes and names of individuals or households that have contributed are recorded in books. However,
only one community was able to show its cash box during the observation of facilities. Major repairs or
spare part purchases sometimes require extra contributions.
Spare part shops and hand pump mechanics
Communities in Koinadugu and Falaba confirmed that Kabala is the only place where they can get spare
parts for hand pumps. While most of the parts are available, some parts can be difficult to get. Some
communities have mechanics that were trained on maintenance, while others hire mechanics from the
chiefdom or from other communities. Communities found that mechanics are always available and
generally affordable.
Monitoring by districts
In Koinadugu and Falaba, community visits by district or ward officials/ councillors to support WASH
services were rare and uncommon. Not a single community leader or woman recalled the last visit by
either district officials or councillors in relation to WASH services. However, the district council officials
were perceived by the community leaders as lobbying on the communities’ behalf for more programs,
either related to WASH or other areas of community development. Community leaders in Bonthe said
that they seldom had visits from the district officials – once or maybe thrice in a year. The councillor from
the Chiefdom headquarters visited more frequently.
Key findings related to EQ10:
FINDING 10.1: Functional systems for O&M of community and school facilities have generally been put in
place in the ASWA-SL target communities; however field observations identify challenges with
functionality of water points.
FINDING 10.2: Follow-up visits from the District WASH teams was limited. The lack of data on the
completed water points similarly indicates weak inspections by the MWR engineers and water point
mappers stationed at district level, although ASWA-SL provided funding for district level monitoring.
9.2.5 EQ11 Effectiveness – unintended results
What are the unintended results (if any) in terms of improving health and WASH status among the
targeted women, children, and communities?
No unintended results were identified in terms of improving access to WASH and health conditions
amongst the communities related to the ASWA-SL activities.
Respondents in the FGDs expressed that having to abandon their work to offer support to the
implementing partners for the implementation of the WASH facilities was a challenge and it reduced their
livelihood. This in turn resulted in the difficulties in raising money for the contribution towards the
projects, like constructing household latrines or contributing to the community’s provision of food and
accommodation for the implementation. These responses are not an indication of lack of appreciation by
the communities of the support for WASH, but more an indication of the livelihood challenges facing many
84
rural households. These responses can inform approaches used by UNICEF and IPs in the future when
mobilising for WASH activities in other communities.
Leaders in some communities claimed that they unexpectedly had to contribute extra funds to ease the
burden on those who could not afford to contribute financially. This indicates a high level of solidarity in
the rural communities. Also, VSLAs have been gaining momentum at community-level.
Key findings related to EQ11:
FINDING 11.1: No unintended results of the ASWA-SL activities in terms of improving WASH access and
health conditions were identified; however communities expressed unintended or unexpected impact on
livelihoods by having to provide labour for implementation restricting the normal income generating
activities.
9.2.6 EQ12 Effectiveness – external factors
What where the main external factors to UNICEF (e.g. political, emergency, or socio-cultural barriers)
that hindered successful attainment of the expected results and how did UNICEF and its partners
address these barriers?
The Project Document identified some risks such as a) misuse of funds by implementing partners, b)
inflation driving up costs, c) weak capacities of government and other partner, leading to delays in
implementation or insufficient capacity to provide a response at the desired scale, d) civil unrest
(upcoming general election), and e) sub-optimal participation of communities, resulting in poor
ownership. ASWA-SL was formulated in 2011-12 before the establishment of the MWR.
Ebola pandemic
Effective implementation of ASWA-SL started in 2013, and in 2014-15 the country was engulfed by the
Ebola epidemic. The Ebola epidemic was an unforeseeable challenge that reversed some gains made by
the ASWA-SL and also forced the programme to suspend implementation to devote efforts to fight the
epidemic. During the crisis, healthcare systems collapsed, and impacted on ASWA-SL’s programme
performance in a number of ways: for instance, concerns about safety of health facilities led to an
estimated 70% drop in clinical admissions and a marked increase in maternal and infant mortality. The
long-term impact of Ebola on infant mortality rates at least partly offset the impact of ASWA-SL on infant
mortality.
The outbreak hampered implementation as the workforce was reduced. Technicians either waited
patiently for free labour or had imported labour and bought materials from elsewhere to continue the
project. Implementation restarted after the country was declared Ebola free.
The Ebola pandemic naturally had a large impact on all population groups in Sierra Leone. One ‘positive’
effect of the Ebola in the ASWA-SL communities and in all areas of Sierra Leone has been the increased
focus on hygiene and hand washing and intensive hygiene promotion campaigns that the Ebola pandemic
prompted. This can have affected positively the responses received from almost all communities on the
knowledge and attitude to hygiene and hand washing. However it may be less reflected in the actual
practices of hand washing as the end-line survey revealed that only 14.6% in Bonthe and 18.1% in
85
Koinadugu of the households in the ASWA-SL communities have hand washing facilities with water and
soap. The increase from the baseline figure of 13.5% in both districts can be attributed to the ASWA-SL
activities as the baseline was also carried out after the Ebola pandemic. These observations are on the
presence of handwashing devices and possibly some households might practice handwashing without
having a dedicated handwashing device.
Weather and access
Seasonality and weather events/ natural disasters affected road networks and caused migration of
beneficiaries (heavy rains, wildfires, timber vehicles destroying roads).
A major unforeseen barrier was the poor road infrastructure in the project areas that was perpetually
impassable during the raining season. The rainy season usually limited operations for 2-3 months. The
disruptions were in part mitigated by stockpiling construction materials during the dry season and limiting
external travel. To access difficult terrain during the rainy season, other means of transportation, such as
motor bikes, were used. Partners were able to plan their activities; one partner stated that: “We plan
before the raining season. We dodge those two months, and we make sure we do the chunk of the work
before and may be after the rains fall heavily”. It seems evident that the IPs were addressing the
challenges effectively.
During the farming season, it was difficult to meet with key stakeholders in the communities as they were
busy on their farms. Meeting times were adjusted to meet with key stakeholders when they were not
engaged in farming.
One IP suggested that rather than have one level of cost for all areas that allowance should be made for
the higher costs incurred when operating in remote areas with difficult access. UNICEF clarified to the
Evaluation Team that the IPs are presenting their budgets for the activities and the issues related to higher
costs in remote areas should be discussed between UNICEF and the IPs at that stage.
Politics
During the elections in 2018, some staff and beneficiaries were unavailable to work on projects. For
example, political campaigns took away young men that provided labour, women who cooked for and fed
technicians and people who provided local materials for project implementation.
Access to parts and services
Major barriers hindering continued access to services mentioned by the stakeholders included a)
insufficient access to spare parts and technical WASH maintenance personnel, and b) insufficient finance
for maintenance and c) seasonality of hand dug wells and sources for piped gravity systems.
Policy environment
The upscaling of the CLTS, SLTS and community water supply depended on GoSL for the creation of an
enabling environment and continued support, and on community commitment to maintain the facilities
and continue sanitation and hygiene activities.
A conducive policy framework was in general in place since the formulation of the NWSP in 2010, but the
implementation of the intentions in the policies remained insufficient throughout ASWA-SL
implementation. Constraints included insufficient capacity and availability of funding at national and
district levels to effectively carry out the coordination and planning as well as the supervision, inspection
86
and monitoring activities needed to ensure effective service delivery by IPs as well as supporting
communities.
The NRWSSP was intended to operationalise the enabling framework as outlined in the NWSP, but while
it was approved in 2017, formal implementation has not yet started and the capacity constraints in the
sector remains.
Key findings related to EQ12:
FINDING 12.1: GoSL, UNICEF and IPs responded appropriately and with flexibility to major upheavals, such
as the Ebola pandemic. Similarly flexibility was shown in mitigating logistic challenges.

9.3.1 EQ13 Efficiency – Program cost and coverage
What were the program costs compared to its coverage?
Only a broad assessment could be made on programme costs, as data was not fully available to the
evaluation. The ET’s understanding of the ASWA-SL budgets is shown on Table 9-5. The original budget
for the DGIS contribution was USD 9.97m. The programme was temporarily suspended during the Ebola
outbreak and funds were re-programmed for Ebola response in agreement with DGIS. A separate grant
from DGIS was provided for the Ebola response. The final budget of ASWA-SL was USD 7.9m plus the
contributions from UNICEF, GoSL and Communities resulting in a final contribution of USD 10.81m. By end
2019, there was an 80% utilization rate of the DGIS funding.
The anticipated contributions from other partners were 20% from UNICEF Sierra Leone, GoSL and
communities, including in-kind contributions, such as UNICEF’s design and implementation of the
sustainability framework and community contributions. See Table 9-5 that outlines the utilization rate
after project closure. It appears that the actual contributions by UNICEF have been increased compared
to the budget. The Government and community contributions are reported to remain as budgeted
however in percentage terms these have increased since less of the overall DIS funding has been utilised
due to some activities not yet being completed.
Table 9-5: Reported utilization for UNICEF, GoSL and Communities
Budget (USD) Budget Final Report 2020
Contribution Percentage Final Contribution Percentage
DGIS 9,974,686 80% 7,959,346 74%

Total 12,486,082 100% 10,806,214 100%
88
The actual cost per beneficiary was consistent with the original budget, with minor variations as shown in
Table 9-6.

The unit costs presented in the Table 9-6 are found reasonable compared to the costs generally seen in
Sierra Leone as reflected in the NRWSSP estimates; however the comments above in Chapter 9.2.2 on the
difficulties in assessing the actual number of persons served, combined with the lack of actual data on the
implementation of projects including the costs experienced for the respective facilities and activities
hinders an accurate assessment of the actual unit costs.
Key findings related to EQ13:
FINDING 13.1: The ASWA-SL unit costs appear reasonable compared to costs experienced in Sierra Leone
generally, but it is not possible with the available data to fully confirm the actual unit cost of facilities,
hygiene education, and capacity building to access its overall cost efficiency.
9.3.2 EQ14 Efficiency – adequacy of resources
To what extent have human, financial and material resources been adequate (in quantity), sufficient (in
quality) and distributed/ deployed in a timely manner for achieving results?
Adequacy of financial resources
District stakeholders and some IPs reported that the financial and human resources provided by UNICEF
were adequate for the quality of WASH infrastructure but inadequate for effective capacity development.
The training was thus not completed as promised. However, some communities reported that they had
not received training because they had prior knowledge on their roles in the implementation and not due
to inadequate resources.
Other IPs, on the other hand, expressed concern over the 10-12% partner contribution, although this is
an important part of the partnership arrangements between UNICEF and the IPs.
89
Other concerns raised by the IPs included case-by-case cost of water points, especially in areas where the
water table was low and completion of water points that are not seasonal can be more costly. Concern
was also expressed by IPs regarding distribution of logistics for implementation; “Some were given motor
bikes while others were given 4WD vehicles”. While this expresses the opinion of some IPs, vehicles are
costly, and UNICEF has clarified that these were used vehicles that UNICEF passed on to the partners
based on availability.
Despite the considerable achievement of results, IPs reported that some interventions were not
adequately budgeted during the process of design and costing by the IPs. For example where designs of
interventions were revised for various reasons, this would have a knock-on effect on costs. The IPs
expressed the opinion that such changes were not always adequately resolved between UNICEF and the
IP. For example, for the gravity flow water systems visited, costs had increased beyond the budget agreed
with UNICEF, in some cases very substantially. Some apparent errors in the system design exacerbated
this problem. One of the consequences of this situation is that four out of eight gravity flow systems visited
by the evaluation team were still incomplete by end 2020.
UNICEF, however, reported that where there are revisions on the design of a WASH facility, UNICEF had
where necessary revised budgets and paid for the additional quantities using the unit rates quoted by the
IP.
UNICEF also stressed that most of the gravity-fed systems covered were only being rehabilitated under
ASWA, and this had influenced the designs and improvements that could be achieved. While recognising
that many of the gravity-fed systems were only rehabilitated under the ASWA project, the Evaluation
Team, however, finds it important, that when funding is used for rehabilitation of existing systems, these
should be put back into full working order and work implemented in accordance with appropriate quality
and designs. This is in particular important in the rural WASH situation in Sierra Leone where there are
serious challenges with seasonality and functionality of the existing water systems.
At a number of other localities facilities had not been completed at the time of the visits by the evaluation
team. The discussions with the IPs and community members revealed that this is due to various reasons
including the planning and budgeting issues. UNICEF WASH has expressed the opinion that the findings
from the field are unbalanced and that generally budgeting was efficient.
Community leaders also expressed that there were a lot of delays, due to financial support directed to
fighting the Ebola pandemic. Some facilities were completed while others were still under implementation
in late 2020. Work on some facilities had been suspended and they were only completed during 2020 or
were still under construction when the facilities observations were carried out by the evaluation team.
Timeliness of disbursements
All IPs reported that UNICEF quickly disbursed the first tranche of funds after signing PCAs. Financial
reporting by IPs to UNICEF was the basis for further disbursement. However, IPs reported that agreements
were not managed in a timely manner. Some IPs expressed concern on the “timeliness” of funds
disbursements. The development of water points was seasonal. When funds were disbursed close to the
rainy season at the start of implementation, implementation had to be postponed until the dry season,
when the true level of the water table was reached. This affected financial reporting and further
disbursements and delayed timely completion of implementation.
90
Some IPs expressed that they had to shoulder the financial burden, and in some cases, costs still remain
unresolved. One IP reported that in the agreement they were to co-finance at 20%, but resultantly had to
co-finance 60% of project costs, with payments still outstanding.73 The IP expressed that they were
required to pre-finance program activities and were often faced with challenges that affect efficiency in
the delivery of intended results. UNICEF WASH has expressed that IPs have not been required to pre-
finance activities beyond the agreed proportions. A detailed audit of disbursements and reporting beyond
the scope of this evaluation would be needed to clarify these issues; however the evaluation only
highlights that the smooth implementation of future interventions would benefit from clarifying the
financial responsibilities between UNICEF and the IPs in a well-document manner highlighting cost
overrun issues when they arise.
Some of the youth that had been hired to be part of the project in the various communities had reportedly
not been paid by the IPs. While this might be opportunistic by the youth, it indicates that the
communication of roles and responsibilities for implementation needs attention by UNICEF and the IPs.
District stakeholders also lamented that there were delays in the payment for the purchase of materials
and staff salaries and pointed out that the UNICEF’s internal bureaucracy sometimes delayed
implementation. ASWA-SL did not pay staff salaries at district level, so the misunderstanding is likely to
be related to disbursement of the contribution to the cost for districts to carry out their monitoring
obligations.
Contribution from beneficiaries
Community contribution comprised unpaid unskilled labour, accommodation, and preparation of food for
skilled labour. The communities also provided local materials, which were paid for by UNICEF through the
IPs. The IPs also reported that no community organised child labour in the work or food and local materials
as this was against UNICEF regulations.
There was no financial community contribution to capital expenditure to replicate similar WASH
infrastructure. However, cash contributions were made by the communities to enable WASH Committees
to repair and maintain the WASH facilities.
There were challenges with the availability of unskilled labour, especially at the peak of farming.
Community leaders reported that they organised youth groups to support the IPs during the work to avoid
delays in project completion.
Availability of materials and skilled personnel
In general, human resources were adequate, albeit with partners reporting problems at certain periods,
and also reporting continuity problems. All IPs reported availability of quality materials as needed and
equipment and skilled personnel in all programme locations as well as at central level for construction of
WASH infrastructure. These requirements were said to be embedded in the PCA/ToRs of IPs.
Communities commended the contractors for the boreholes for qualified personnel, equipment, and the
modest need for involving community members in their work. The team of engineers that identified the
locations for the water points were also commended. The contractors who failed to complete their
73 The ET were unable to review financial reports for each individual partner and payment.
91
projects, such as the unfinished reservoir projects, were considered inefficient and having lower quality
equipment. Communities in Bonthe found that contractors generally used good quality materials (e.g.
concrete aggregates, building sand) and these were readily available. However, some communities
reported that some of the school toilets failed within a very short period after construction. As presented
in 'Appendix 7 Facilities Observations Checklist – Technical Narrative’, the Evaluation Team found that the
construction quality was generally good, but with some room for improvement.
Community members responded that they did not require training for their tasks but received guidance
on what to do while working with some contractors.
The facilities observations revealed that the quality of construction of facilities was generally fair to good,
but there were some areas of weakness and particular facilities, which were not satisfactory. These are
discussed in detail in Appendix 7 Facilities Observations Checklist – Technical Narrative).Key challenges
included:
− Most rainwater harvesting installations inspected were not satisfactory and this included both school
and domestic installations.
− Some hand dug well rehabilitations had been carried out on wells where rehabilitation was not
feasible, usually because deepening was not possible due to hard rock.
− The hatches provided for well covers were much improved compared to typical wells in Sierra Leone,
but further improvements are required to ensure they provide sanitary protection of the well.
− The hinges of security gates for the concrete fences around hand pumps were sometimes poorly
anchored in the concrete.
− In piped water systems there were many cases where pipelines had not been installed at sufficient
depth and so had become exposed to damage or interference.
− The capacity of the distribution system at 2 solar borehole piped systems appeared to be limited and
this may be due to design and/or construction issues.
Key findings related to EQ14:
FINDING 14.1: The resources available for the ASWA-SL implementation were adequate, but challenges
were experienced in the budgeting for some interventions such as piped systems and wells in difficult
hydrogeological areas like Koinadugu/ Falaba and this led to implementation challenges.
FINDING 14.2: The quality of construction of facilities was generally fair to good, but there were some
areas of weakness related to the siting of hand-dug wells and design of piped systems.
9.3.3 EQ15 Efficiency – district and local level collaboration
How effective was partner collaboration with district and local structures?
Engagement with local government
Improved stakeholder collaboration at district and local levels was a strength of ASWA-SL, as described in
KIIs and FGDs. IPs and UNICEF staff worked continuously with stakeholders and identified groups on
sensitization activities. However, while partnerships with district authorities were more challenging,
progress was made in developing coordination structures. District focal points worked at district and
92
chiefdom levels to support supervision and coordination throughout the programme period. District
council officers in the districts were engaged and staff capacities enhanced through training (e.g.
preparedness and planning training).
UNICEF supported District Health Management Teams (DHMT) in enhanced harmonization of various
functional structures at the district and community levels such as the roles of the district public health
superintendent and public health aids to best serve ASWA-SL and related WASH interventions at
community-level.
The engagement with the District Councils included improving continuous monitoring of needs and
priorities through the roll-out of the Akvo mobile phone-based monitoring platform in all three districts.
Previously, there had been a time lag and inconsistent monitoring of needs at sub-district level, and the
introduction of the platform supported district structures in coordination and collaboration.
ASWA-SL built the capacity of both national and districts government structures to implement the Akvo
Flow mobile phone-based WASH monitoring platform. The mobile phone-based WASH indicator
monitoring, and district-led joint monitoring allowed real-time feedback from and to local leadership and
concerned communities. However, the monitoring tools seem not to have been utilised by ASWA-SL to
collect accurate data and status of the facilities implemented with support from the programme.
The process of district level WASH planning was supported by GoSL, in particular the MLGRD
Decentralisation Secretariat and through various development programmes such as the DfID-funded
WASH Facility supporting the development of district WASH Plans in 2012-13 and the WB support to
financial decentralisation and district development grants.
District support to communities
The support provided by the District Councils and the MWR professional staff stationed at district level to
the communities are perceived by the communities to be very limited. Most communities remarked that
the visits from the district level were infrequent and hardly ever took place. The responses from the
District WASH teams indicate that monthly visits were carried out as required utilising the ASWA-SL
support for monitoring; however the evaluation did not find documentation for this, e.g. by entries in the
national monitoring systems like the water point data.
Key findings related to EQ15:
FINDING 15.1: Coordination at district level generally worked well, with good collaboration with District
Councils, deconcentrated staff from WASH MDAs and other partners active in the districts.
FINDING 15.2: The support provided by the Districts to the communities are perceived by the communities
to be very limited; however District have responded that visits were carried out monthly, but this is not
documented.
93
9.3.4 EQ16 Efficiency – coordination with others
To what extent was the program well-coordinated with other engagements in the WASH sector?
The DGIS part of ASWA-SL was implemented concurrently with a larger DFID funded programme
supporting other districts on WASH in communities, schools, and health centres as well as the AfDB
funded RWSSP in 5 districts including Bonthe and Koinadugu. Some of the national elements of ASWA-SL
targeting sustainability of the WASH sector were co-funded, allowing for good coordination. Because of
the flexibility of the funding mechanism, DGIS’ contribution to ASWA-SL allowed UNICEF to support GoSL
in innovative experimentation that benefited other rural WASH programmes, including: digital
monitoring; development of community-based rainwater harvesting and gravity water schemes in
Koinadugu, and policy guidelines on iron removal in some water facilities and many documents.
ASWA-SL contributed to dialogue and information sharing with other WASH implementers and donors at
the national level in some way – This was facilitated through direct contributions to consultative forums
through experts; and indirectly by paying for staff that contributed to the forums e.g. a WASH specialist
who would input to national policies in progress.
National stakeholders found that the national level mechanism for dialogue and information sharing with
implementing partners and donors was primarily through national coordination meetings expected to be
carried out quarterly and the annual sector review conference. However these dialogue mechanisms were
generally irregular. The coordination meetings were sometimes only held once a year and the annual
conference was skipped a number of times, partly due to funding constraints and the unforeseen
circumstances such as the Ebola epidemic. The effectiveness of sector coordination has also been affected
unclarity about whether MWR or MoHS were to lead, although MWR has been slated to lead a diverse
sector with more than three ministries involved. Despite the irregular formal consultations there appear
to no overlaps in the target areas for ASWA-SL and other implementing partners or Development Partner
programmes.
ASWA-SL supported an M&E platform for virtual progress updates and sharing of information on
implementation of WASH in the districts. The tools are working, but there seems to be issues with the
regular updates on the project achievements. UNICEF complemented the support from other partners,
such as AfDB, for the development of the national WASH M&E framework, including part-funding of an
SDG baseline survey and for updating the water point mapping carried out by Statistics Sierra Leone (SSL)
in 2016.
District coordination meetings with WASH actors are held regularly (monthly) to discuss implementation
and funding mechanisms. These meetings discussed the various roles and intervention areas of ASWA-SL
IPs and other development partners. This prevented duplication of effort and followed best practice.
However, the coordination faced some challenges, such as inadequate funding, insufficiently
communication channels, and poor road and transport infrastructure complicating attendance.
IPs shared information with WASH stakeholders during community meetings, monthly joint monitoring
visits and update meetings with WASH MDAs at district level. Additionally, monthly progress reports were
submitted both to the District WASH MDAs. The IPs experienced no challenges with district dialogue.
94
Locations of WASH deprived/ vulnerable communities were shared by national/ central level MDAs with
UNICEF during programme design and planning. IPs, District WASH MDAs and beneficiaries verified this
information during the assessment of target beneficiaries. UNICEF convened project update/ progress
meetings and annual/ midterm with IPs and WASH MDAs.
Key findings related to EQ16:
FINDING 16.1: Coordination at the national level was working with some coordination between WASH
MDAs and implementing partners. However the coordination mechanisms such as the Sector
Coordination Meetings and the Steering Committee Meetings were not regular.
FINDING 16.2: Despite the irregular formal consultations there appear to be no overlaps in the target
areas for ASWA-SL and other implementing partners or Development Partner programmes.
9.3.5 EQ17 Efficiency – UNICEF contributing internal factors.
What where the main internal factors to UNICEF and its implementing partners that contributed to
successful attainment of the expected results?74
UNICEF support
The responses from the KIIs with IPs indicate that UNICEF staff (technical, financial, M&E, and cross-
cutting section staff and management staff i.e. Deputy Representative) provided some support to IPs in
order to facilitate implementation. UNICEF structures were supportive of IPs, which were supported with
trainings, programme reviews, and coordination meetings, which allowed IPs to discuss progress and
challenges. UNICEF also provided technical supportive supervision.
IPs largely reported smooth processes and support to initiate projects. UNICEF staff were found
supportive in finding the most efficient methods of initiating projects and supported partners with major
logistic needs (e.g. for the water point mapping). Support from the UNICEF Regional Office (i.e. through
ASWA-WCA) in identifying partners and supporting the designing of projects; and one interviewee
suggested that where regional intervention was made, the project approval was facilitated in an efficient
manner.
Training was provided to IPs on a) financial management procedures (HACT), b) project implementation
strategies, guidelines and tools, and c) monitoring and reporting procedures. Organizational capacity
support was also provided, including staff, vehicles, equipment. The IPs reported no challenges with
adhering to UNICEF rules and procedures.
Advance financial support was provided to IPs to procure construction material including cost of
transportation of materials, basic construction tools, computers and accessories, and skilled labour.
Motorbikes were provided for staff movement, although due to an increased number of IPs this was later
changed to bicycles and fuel.
74 Sources of evidence: KIIs (UNICEF Chiefs from other sections)
95
Most IPs found that the support provided was adequate whilst others suggested that UNICEF should waive
the 12% partner contribution; and would have preferred if ASWA-SL had provided a vehicle instead of
motorbikes as the terrain in beneficiary communities was difficult to traverse.
The selection of the programme model was based on previous experiences/ lessons in similar contexts,
and this facilitated programme success. ASWA-SL continued supporting development of the participatory
methodologies under its CLTS approach.
UNICEF also supported the IPs in adjustments to the plans when needed. For example, midway through
implementation, for Result Area 1 (access to safe water) plans were modified to include drilling deeper,
motorized boreholes with large-reticulated gravity schemes to serve schools, health care facilities and
communities which are in close proximity to each other from one source, as opposed to construction of
individual hand dug wells only.
The capacity of partners was continuously supported as UNICEF employed an engineer who worked hand
in hand with IPs, providing technical advice, and supported infrastructure design and monitoring.
There were some problems with the support or input provided by UNICEF to IPs in the survey and design
of the gravity water systems as evidenced by the failure of water from the sources to reach the storage
tanks in 3 of the 8 systems.
M&E and decision-making
There is some indication that UNICEF M&E systems contributed to informed decision-making and program
management. UNICEF’s systems for planning and monitoring contributed through programme review
committee inputs and oversight, reporting modalities (i.e. partner reporting, Programme Strategy Notes),
and mid-year and end-of-year reviews where lessons learned were identified with IPs. The UNICEF Chief
of Planning and Monitoring, and senior management (i.e. Deputy Representative) carried out oversight.
It appears that the Progress Database was the only tracking mechanism (with end reporting in 2019) with
community-level data disaggregated by men, women, boys, and girls. The Programme Implementation
tracking tables additionally tracked boys and girls, but only in relation to the use of WASH facilities in
schools.
To understand community capacity levels, UNICEF developed a digital real-time monitoring system with
photos and progression step-by-step monitoring. Community apathy was identified early on in ASWA-SL
and targeted with continuous, multi-factor support. There was also an early understanding of low
community capacities to carry out and maintain WASH inputs. ASWA-SL monitored the outputs of various
trained groups continuously to ensure the knowledge and skills acquired were translated into action in
timely manner.
The IPs stated that the programme indicators were monitored through joint monitoring visits by District
MDAs and UNICEF M&E staff. Reports from SMCs, DHMT/ and Health Units and informal conversions with
beneficiaries were also used for monitoring indicators. It was reported that decisions were made after
debriefing from the joint monitoring visits on issues of concern.
UNICEF supported capacity building of both national and districts government structures to implement
the Akvo flow mobile phone-based WASH monitoring platform. Roll-out of the Akvo based monitoring
platform was done in all 13 districts (including the two newly created districts of Falaba and Karene)
96
receiving UNICEF WASH support. The system enhanced real-time reporting of data from all WASH
activities in the 13 districts. In addition, digital water quality monitoring and reporting using Akvo caddisfly
was also undertaken nationally and updated in the national water quality map. Mobile phone-based
WASH indicator-monitoring and district-led joint monitoring provided real-time feedback from and to
local leadership and concerned communities.
National stakeholders mentioned that while the M&E platform was established, the MWR did not have
funding for data collection, even if only on quarterly basis. The district WASH teams, especially the district
mappers were not provided with the requisite logistics to collect M&E data. This does not reflect that the
national and district stakeholders expect UNICEF funding for all the M&E activities, but only that generally
there is a serious problem with resources in WASH Ministries and Districts to cover the recurrent costs. In
effect, the M&E platform and data collection was not regularly used for decision-making. Nonetheless,
the district team were provided support for monitoring and reporting to UNICEF in addition to UNICEF’s
and the IPs’ own monitoring.
Key findings related to EQ17:
FINDING 17.1: IPs were broadly satisfied with the support provided by the UNICEF staff to facilitate
implementation.
FINDING 17.2: The sector M&E tools, such as water point mapping data were not utilized to document
the completed facilities and their functionality, although the development of these tools was supported
by ASWA-SL. This results in lack of data on the actual achievements.
9.3.6 EQ18 Efficiency – UNICEF hindering internal factors.
What where the main internal factors to UNICEF and its implementing partners that hindered successful
attainment of the expected results and how did UNICEF and its partners address these barriers?
Challenges related to UNICEF procurement and pre-financing requirements.
IPs largely reported that the UNICEF processes produced mixed results for closing projects. Procurement
processes were identified as bottlenecks for project closure. When supplies were procured through
UNICEF processes, delays were sometimes experienced. These are the views of the IPs and the application
of proper and well documented procurement procedures by UNICEF can obviously lead to delays in
procurement, so these concerns are seen by the evaluation team as an indication that some more
communication on the reasons for the delays need to be shared with the IPs by UNICEF.
As described under EQ14, IPs experienced implementation and financial challenges due to late
disbursement of funds from UNICEF. It must be recognised that late disbursement can be caused by
inadequate or late reporting by the IPs. The necessity of IPs pre-financing program activities was seen by
the IPs as well as the District WASH stakeholders as a challenge that affected the timeliness of the delivery
of intended results. The administration of the ASWA-SL implementation obviously needs proper
documentation and financial reporting, so while detailed investigation or audit of the administrative
aspects is beyond the scope of the evaluation, again these concerns expressed by the partners point
towards the need for increased transparency and communication between the UNICEF WASH team and
the IPs on procurement and financial reporting issues.
97
District stakeholders found procurement and contract management procedures insufficiently
transparent. For example, after defining the quantity and quality of materials required to carry out certain
work, the next stages of procurement were not made known to them. UNICEF has clarified that the
UNICEF procurement policies and guidelines have been followed, so the opinions expressed by the District
stakeholders points towards the need for better communication to the District stakeholders of the UNICEF
procedures before and during implementation.
Changes of UNICEF staff in senior positions and lack of clarity on whom the UNICEF focal points were,
were other bottlenecks mentioned for project closure. Transitions between new staff taking up posts were
unclear – specifically for the WASH Chief – and IPs widely suggested priorities changed with staff and did
not ensure continuity of programme decisions.
District stakeholders lamented that there were delays in the payment for the purchase of materials and
staff salaries – since ASWA-SL did not cover staff salaries in Districts, this is likely to relate to experiences
with delays in providing the funding to Districts for monitoring activities. That this is an issue further
highlights the challenges for the Districts to support the WASH activities in the communities through their
own budgets without development partner support. They pointed out that the UNICEF’s internal
bureaucracy in terms of disbursement of funds sometimes delayed implementation.
The IPs reported no challenges with adhering to UNICEF rules and procedures as the IPs agreed to abide
by these in the PCA/ToRs.
Support from UNICEF
IPs mentioned financial support to procure construction material including cost of transportation of
materials, basic construction tools, computers, and accessories, paid for skilled labour, and provided
specialized training of staff to enhance all aspects of implementation and logistical support in the form of
motorbikes for staff movement. It was noted that due to increasing number of IPs UNICEF now provides
only bikes and fuel. It was also stated that UNICEF provided technical supportive supervision as well as
coordination meetings.
Most IPs reported that support was adequate whilst others suggested that UNICEF should waive the 12%
partner contribution and consider vehicle support not motorbikes as the terrains in beneficiary
communities are difficult to traverse. While this reflect real difficulties for the IPs in carrying out the
implementation work in hard to reach communities it naturally needs to be assessed by UNICEF if this
would add to the cost efficiency of the project implementation. Again, it points towards improved
communication with the IPs to discuss the implementation challenges and how best to improve cost and
time for completing the activities.
Additionally, some IPs reported implementation challenges such as disbursement of funds towards the
rainy season. It was mentioned that access to communities became difficult, seasonality of water points
delayed timely completion and that communities did not provide timely support in the form of unskilled
labour. These challenges expressed by IPs might also be related to delays or accuracy in the reporting by
the IPs to UNICEF; however it points towards the need for more transparency and communication in the
joint planning processes between UNICEF WASH and the IPs.
98
Key findings related to EQ18:
FINDING 18.1: IPs were largely satisfied with the internal UNICEF processes and support to
implementation, although slow disbursement at times hampered timely implementation and construction
of facilities. It must be recognised that the delays might have been affected by the timely delivery of report
from the IPs.
FINDING 18.2: Opinions from IPs and District WASH stakeholders on issues related to procurement, pre-
financing, and timing of funding points to need for more transparency and communication on the UNICEF
procedures.

To what extent are communities able and willing to contribute to ensuring the sustainability of the
WASH infrastructure provided and continue with hygiene and health practices introduced by the
project?75
Capacity to carry out O&M.
At the community level, clear roles and responsibilities for existing community structures were utilised,
and capacities of different responsible community groups were built, contributing to sustainability of
behaviour change. However, insufficient capacities remain a challenge. Different community groups were
trained based on the assumption that communities would be able to manage WASH facilities and hygiene
practices. By addressing barriers and integrating solutions within existing community systems (e.g.
community groups) and power structures, longer term operation and maintenance of facilities was
integrated. Local private sector entrepreneurs were trained on san-plat development (platforms for
sanitation facilities), to build toilets for households, and to repair handpumps.
The sustainability of the sanitation and hygiene activities were enhanced by relying on local capacities in
the implementation. This included Chiefs being engaged to provide leadership for CLTS; ‘natural leaders’76
appointed at chiefdom level and equipped with bicycles to provide leadership to community members
around a common goal of achieving ODF status. The natural leaders remain instrumental in ensuring
communities attained ODF status, while the CLTS facilitators provided quality triggering guidance to all
communities. Community resource persons were also identified and continuously supported capacity
strengthening activities at the community level; the number of community resource persons surpassed
the targets for 2018.
However, despite the considerable effort, the responses indicate that the communities remain not fully
equipped to sustain ASWA-SL interventions. While ASWA-SL built community capacities for basic O&M,
communities remain challenged vis-à-vis contributing to minor repairs, due to lack of knowledge of actual
O&M cost implications, resulting in deficient tariff regimes, which in turn undermines the ability to
generate requisite funds for some repair demands. Inadequate skills, and limited access to tools and

and hygiene. These can be formal leaders like chiefs and elders and also other prominent or respected persons in
the community such as teachers.
100
spare-parts are other barriers. Tools were not provided to trained mechanics and some handpumps were
left unattended after breakdown. ASWA-SL reporting indicated that apathy was another key challenge.
There are indications that local NGO partners will continue supporting sustainability in communities and
schools, although on a lesser scale. Local partners found that continuous engagement was necessary to
ensure sustainability of local committees, such as SHCs and WASH Committees. Committees needed
regular visits from local partners to ensure their awareness of ownerships, and refresher trainings had
been required. Nonetheless, community leaders in Bonthe affirmed that they would continue monitoring
the water points and toilets facilities through the WASH committee. Moreover, the community groups
consulted confirmed that they found it important to continue with improved hygiene practices.
Despite these limitations, the ASWA-SL furthered some promising innovations which contribute to
sustainability. Some of these initiatives worked towards achieving dual aims of sustainability and
contributing to gender equity. For instance, the Village Savings and Loan Association (VSLA) concept was
implemented in 177 villages, with a membership of 62% women. While communities reported that the
VSLAs had not been able to accumulate any tariffs to contribute to WASH O&M, they did assist in raising
the financial capacity of their members, in particular women.
Schools were able to leverage skills from trainings to ensure School Health Clubs remain fully functional,
although some IPs suggest that regular sensitization through refresher trainings would be needed to
ensure sustainable functioning.
Willingness to pay.
A consistent concern flagged in communities and in schools was that inadequate support had been given
to identify recurrent funding to support interventions. Generally, communities confirmed the willingness
of households to pay for maintaining water services. Households that failed to pay would not be allowed
to use the facilities was used as the main method to encourage contributions by all. The end-line study
showed that 70% (60% in Bonthe, 86% in Koinadugu) of the households were willing to contribute
financially for access to improved water sources.
On the upkeep, upgrading and replacement of toilets, there were mixed responses. Households were said
to be willing to pay, but some did not have the financial capability to replace or build toilets.
Teachers, students, and children are willing and able to continue with school WASH activities, but there
are clear limitations vis-à-vis financial capacity to maintain facilities. The sustainability of WASH in schools
is a challenge, partly due to the costs of source improvements in remote areas (where groundwater access
is technically challenging), as well as the high cost of WASH facilities according to new WASH in Schools
(WinS) standards.
Although ASWA-SL contributed to the National WASH in Schools Guidelines (2017), there are scant
financial resources to sustain WinS interventions. Teachers suggested that financial support would be
needed for maintenance, since the financial resources from District Councils are insufficient. Even
replacing soap at school latrines was seen as a challenge. Many school stakeholders believe that funding
allocations being made to District Councils, and not to schools, is a hindrance. Some quotes from teachers/
headteacher KIIs:
101
“Sanitation facilities fully functional, hygienic but not well maintained. No support has been received for
maintenance”; “Facility has been broken, it has not been fixed because of no availability of fund” and “I
personally paid people to clean up the solar water system for good functioning.”
While SMCs work well, their activities are limited due to these concerns.
Continuation of hygiene and water supply improvements
There a good degree of success in achieving sustainability one year after implementation. In 2019, the
proportion of communities triggered during CLTS activities and externally verified as ODF within one year
was 93%. The proportion of externally verified water safe communities that maintained water safe status
for at least one year was 84% in 2019. The proportion of schools in which students routinely practiced
handwashing with water and soap after visiting the toilet at least one year after implementation was 82%
in 2019. In many schools visited, sanitation facilities were fully functional, but not well maintained.
However, despite these successes, longer-term sustainability at the community level continues to be a
challenge, with particular respect to sustainability of behavioural change and operation and maintenance
and challenges described above.
Key findings related to EQ19:
FINDING 19.1: Communities are generally willing to pay for WASH services and pay either on a monthly
basis or when there is a need for repairs. Hand pumps are maintained in some communities.
FINDING 19.2: There was some success in achieving sustainability one year after program closure, but in
some communities sustainability continues to be a challenge, in particular with respect to the
sustainability of behavioural change and maintaining ODF status, and ability to pay for replication of
toilets.
FINDING 19.3: In many schools, sanitation facilities are fully functional, but not well maintained. Some
School Health Clubs are functional, and IPs expressed that continued support is needed to ensure
sustainability.
9.4.2 EQ20 Sustainability – continuation – district and national level
To what extent is the government at national and local levels able and willing to ensure the
sustainability of the WASH infrastructure provided and continue with the promotion of hygiene and
health practices introduced by the project?
Sustainability strategy
To track ASWA-SL, a robust and coherent system was put in place to oversee operation and maintenance
of WASH facilities. Sustainability was at the heart of ASWA-WCA, where the sustainability of WASH
facilities and behaviour change was promoted. A key mechanism was the Sustainability Check. A
sustainability framework guided ASWA-WCA, see Figure 9-12. The sustainability interventions were highly
structured and well-planned.
102
Figure 9-12: Initiatives that input to sustainability at a strategic level in ASWA-WCA.
The Sustainability Compact was an effort
by GoSL to improve the functionality and
use of WASH services. UNICEF supported
the GoSL in scaling up decentralized,
participatory monitoring bringing together
local government leaders, technical teams,
women, and children in appraising
implementation processes as well as
verifying the completed work before
handover to GoSL.
District Councils and IPs were provided
with logistic support, transport and
vehicles/ motorbikes required to carry out
monitoring. The Sustainability Compact was signed by UNICEF, and that two out of a target of five
sustainability compact action plans were developed, annual sustainability checks completed, and
management responses developed and signed in 2018. Sustainability checks were intended to be
conducted annually or every second year, but in practice the checks were not carried out frequently; there
is only evidence of a sustainability check in 2018.
In its initial stages, ASWA-SL identified the key barriers for sustainability, determining that schemes in
Sierra Leone were often inoperative due to insufficient funding, inappropriate technology, lack of
community involvement, inadequately trained personnel, and insufficient tools and equipment. Many of
these barriers were addressed in various programme modalities.
The sustainability framework was well-designed, but there was a “start and stop” approach, with some
inputs and initiatives between partners being disjointed. This limited a coherent and well-recognized
WASH sustainability framework. For instance, the monitoring of access to WASH (such as water point
mapping) was not necessary joined with other sustainability efforts, such as sustainability checks, studies
carried out by third parties to monitor the implementation of the Sustainability Compact. Attempts were
made to ensure the framework was operationalized and make the framework more actionable and
enhance accountability. Two more components were added: a) Action Plans, technical working
documents aimed at operationalizing the Sustainability Compact and b) a joint Management Response to
the sustainability check from GoSL and UNICEF.
A key part of ensuring sustainability of WASH improvements is the monitoring of status in the
communities. UNICEF and ASWA-SL contributed to improving the sector M&E however the interventions
were not fully embedded in the national and district partners to ensure continued use. Some support
provided through ASWA-SL could have had wider impact if accompanied with follow-up to ensure
upscaling. UNICEF hired third parties, rather than relying on District WASH teams, to carry out monitoring,
but only in districts covered by UNICEF and therefore not contributing effectively to the national WASH
M&E. Without a sector-wide system in place, the district-wide efforts will have limited impact on overall
levels of access to data, and the use of the M&E data to identify where new projects should engage.
103
ASWA II will continue supporting the of national sustainability frameworks, indicating a continued degree
of functionality in coming years. It is less clear whether GoSL would be fully committed to these
frameworks in the absence of continued donor funding.
National and district budgets for continuation of support
The support to communities from the Districts appears limited at best. ASWA-SL allocated resources to
support a gradual GoSL takeover, however, the extent to which this has taken place is unclear.
A project exit strategy was defined in the 2017 WASH Sustainability Check77, which identified potential
threats to the sustainability of ASWA, including:
− Concerns about the pace of operationalization of the sector policies and revised legal framework, as
a basis for a transition from external assistance to local ownership.
− An unexplained absence of budgetary provisions for ASWA-SL in GoSL plans (national and local),
undermining prospects for a smooth transition to GoSL ownership and diminishing post-
implementation support.
− Unclarity about the extent to which District level partners would sustain interventions introduced by
the programme.78
Key findings related to EQ20:
FINDING 20.1: The approaches around the sustainability framework were commendable and appropriate,
such as the continued focus on the sustainability framework and WASH Sustainability Checks, but there is
only limited support from district authorities to the communities to continue WASH activities.
FINDING 20.2: District budgets for continued investment and recurrent support to WASH activities are
inadequate, and all communities reported that visits from District officials were infrequent at best.

79 The UN definition of “gender”: Gender: refers to the social attributes and opportunities associated with being
male and female and the relationships between women and men and girls and boys, as well as the relations between
women and those between men. These attributes, opportunities and relationships are socially constructed and are
learned through socialization processes. They are context/ time-specific and changeable. Gender determines what
is expected, allowed and valued in a women or a man in a given context. In most societies there are differences and
inequalities between women and men in responsibilities assigned, activities undertaken, access to and control over
resources, as well as decision-making opportunities. Gender is part of the broader socio-cultural context. Other
important criteria for socio-cultural analysis include class, race, poverty level, ethnic group and age .See UN Women,
OSAGI Gender Mainstreaming - Concepts and definitions (un.org)
80 Equity refers to minimising differences in access to WASH services geographically and socially including “gender
equity” defined as: The process of being fair to men and women, boys and girls, and importantly the equality of
outcomes and results. Gender equity may involve the use of temporary special measures to compensate for
historical or systemic bias or discrimination. It refers to differential treatment that is fair and positively addresses a
bias or disadvantage that is due to gender roles or norms or differences between the sexes. Equity ensures that
women and men and girls and boys have an equal chance, not only at the starting point, but also when reaching the
finishing line. It is about the fair and just treatment of both sexes that takes into account the different needs of the
men and women, cultural barriers and (past) discrimination of the specific group. See UNICEF Glossary of Terms and
Concepts, November 2017. Gender equality: GLOSSARY OF TERMS AND CONCEPTS (unicef.org)

9.5.1 EQ21 GEHR – design addressing GEHR.
To what extent did the program design address gender, equity and human rights issues including the
particular situation of vulnerable households (elderly persons, persons living with disabilities, very poor
households)?
Approaches
ASWA-SL aimed to ensure there was equal representation of men and women in WASH decision-making
and management, by using the universally accepted minimums of 30% equal participation81. For instance,
the project implementation guidelines stressed the need for participation of women in all project
management committees with a minimum requirement of 30% women participating. WASH committee
members were monitored for equal participation.
All IPs clearly followed the minimum standards, by ensuring at least one female member is either a chair
or deputy chairperson of WASH Committees. Efforts were made to ensure women were heard during
inception and design meetings, with IPs encouraging more women to join to reduce male dominance.
Women were also consulted in the site selection for WASH facilities. Trainings were organized and
community consultations were carried out to sensitize community-members on the gender parity
requirements of ASWA-SL. IPs reported equal representation of men and women in community WASH
Committees, 30% women and 70% men in SMCs, and 80% women and 20% men in VSLAs.
It was confirmed by consultations in the communities and districts that efforts were made to include
vulnerable groups, including people living with disabilities. District stakeholders expressed that adequate
participation of vulnerable groups was pursued through continuous community engagement and
encouraging women and people living with disabilities to take leadership positions in the management of
WASH facilities. IPs were satisfied with the level of women’s involvement in decision-making. IPs stated
that representatives of women-headed households, people with physical disabilities, ultra-poor, youths,
and children were able to participate during needs assessment, prioritization of committee membership,
monitoring of project implementation, awareness raising campaigns, and training. IPs were satisfied with
the level of involvement of these vulnerable groups.
All WASH Committees in the consulted communities were made up of both male and female members.
Women held different positions in the various WASH Committees, one WASH Committee had a female
chairperson, while another Committee had a woman as treasurer. Community leaders in Bonthe
expressed that the selection of WASH Committees was done through community participation and
willingness to work. However, 10% of the youth groups said that the selection was entirely based on the
political influence in the community without their consent. A 35% representation of women and old
people was common, while no young persons were involved. WASH Committee chairpersons and
secretaries were typically men, whereas women were typically treasurers, deputy chairpersons, or chief
whips.
81 The ECOSOC resolution of January 1990, reinforced by the 1995 Beijing Platform for Action, stated minimum
standards of 30% participation of women.
106
Toilet designs
Separate toilets for girls and boys and menstrual hygiene facilities were constructed at schools. The toilet
designs used by ASWA-SL were the MEST (now MBSSE) standards82. Drawings for school latrines were
used, with the following features to facilitate menstrual hygiene and disability access: a) separate cubicles
for menstrual hygiene with internal latches for each drop hole, and b) Access ramps, wide doors, internal
latch, extra-large cubicles, and grab rails near drop hole.
Key findings related to EQ21:
FINDING 21.1: There is evidence that ASWA-SL has engaged approaches used to ensure equal
representation of men and women in WASH decision-making and management, using very basic and
universally accepted minimums of equal participation.
FINDING 21.2: ASWA-SL was successful in ensuring equal participation and representation of women and
men in WASH decision-making and management. However, ASWA-SL was not equally successful in
ensuring representation of vulnerable groups, such as persons living with disabilities.
FINDING 21.3: The designs of school toilets were according to national standards with separate toilets for
boys and girls and appropriate facilities for disabled access and menstrual hygiene.
9.5.2 EQ22 GEHR – reaching vulnerable groups.
To what extent were vulnerable/ marginalized women, children, people living with disabilities, elderly
people, child, and female-headed households as well as vulnerable/ marginalized communities reached
by the program and their specific barriers of access to the provided services addressed?83
A full picture of the extent to which vulnerable groups mentioned were reached was inhibited by a lack
of data disaggregation in monitoring of ASWA-SL. It is recognised that there was a gradual progression
with approaches to employing methods of tracking household level data throughout ASWA-SL. Gradually,
household level data was gathered through a survey collecting household level data on water quality.
However, the programme indicators as per the tracking matrix had few disaggregated indicators available
that target children, under any of the results indicators including WASH in Schools. Capacity strengthening
targets teachers, head teachers, education supervisors does not include training of school WASH club
members. The tracking table did track “new students” using sanitation and water points, which can be
assumed to be mainly children.
ASWA-SL reported that 109% of the target for new students using latrines by the programme and 105%
of the target for new students using water points were reached. It can therefore be assumed that the
water points are child-friendly and being used.
Data collected at the community level suggests that IP’s strategies were inclusive, and interventions were
guided by a “leave no one behind” ethos. The community mobilization strategies ensured that all groups
82 “Sierra Leone WASH in Schools – Standards and Guidelines” Draft 7
83 The findings are from community level data collection (KIIs, FGDs and survey)
107
within the community were targeted and reached. Focus-group discussions with the various vulnerable
groups, including women who were marginalised, also helped to ensure that they could express their
needs and explain the barriers they faced. VSLA and sanitation marketing activities targeted the ultra-
poor households.
Access to separate toilets and menstrual hygiene facilities
Separate facilities for girls and boys were available at six out of seven school latrines visited in Bonthe,
and in all four visited in Falaba and Koinadugu. All the latrines inspected had separate cubicles for each
drop hole. All latrines were pit or Ventilated Improved Pit (VIP) latrines and some respondents reported
that absorbent materials were disposed of in the pit. In Bonthe, one of the seven girls’ latrines had a
separate changing room and six had internal door latches. All girls’ latrines in Falaba and Koinadugu had
internal door latches.84
Accessibility for people with disabilities
However, inclusion of people living with disabilities was a challenge despite the fact that their needs were
assessed, and they were encouraged to be part of project management committees They still faced
multiple barriers of mobility.
The Bonthe District Disable Association (BDSA) for example, included special measures, such as focal
points, to engage with vulnerable women to enhance participation. Participatory approaches specifically
targeted women living with disabilities, and the group ensured two members of vulnerable groups were
able to hold executive positions in the SMC/ school WASH management. Another local partner described
how they made special effort for people living with disabilities to participate in activities, despite the
challenges they face with mobility.
However, stakeholders had mixed views on the inclusion of people living with disabilities. Some expressed
that: “vulnerable groups such as physically challenged or disabled, ultra-poor and women were not
involved or participated at any level. The Bonthe Disabled Union (BDU) could have been a better platform
to involve disables for their participation. One major approach used to ensure adequate participation of
vulnerable group is to improve on social inclusion”.
Among the school latrines visited, adequate provisions for pupils with disability were made in 12 out of
13 latrine blocks in Bonthe and all eight latrine blocks visited Falaba and Koinadugu.85
Preferential access for vulnerable groups
Equity was also promoted in the access and use of WASH facilities, with bylaws giving priority to
disadvantaged groups in the use of WASH facilities. For example, school children, people living with
disabilities and the elderly were allowed to fetch water before boys and men. Some communities did not
require that people living with disabilities paid a monthly contribution for water and helped them with
fetching water if their disability prevented them from fetching water from the facilities.

Checklist – Technical Narrative.

108
Safety of facility locations
All school latrines and water points visited were located close enough to school buildings so that they
would be safe to use during school hours, but at many schools there are no resident staff so these facilities
would be less safe outside of school hours.
All point water sources and standpipes inspected were located within, or very close to, settled areas and
safe to use during daylight hours, but perhaps less safe at night. An example is a young boy in Makosie,
Bonthe who was bitten by a snake, when he went to the toilet without a torch. In localities where water
supplies are seasonal, not functioning, incomplete or inadequate for the population women, girls and
boys will still have to venture further afield for water.
Nonetheless, community leaders and women groups expressed that water points locations are safe for
boys, girls and women during both day and night. Toilets were also said to have been constructed not too
far away from households and were considered to be in safe locations for women, girls and boys during
day and night.
Ease of reach for poor households
All water supply water collection points inspected were within the MWR standard for maximum distance
from users of 500 m.86 Community respondents confirmed that water point locations were easy to reach
for households, including the poorest and even people with disabilities. Toilets were also confirmed to be
in locations within easy to reach for all categories of people.
Some inspected facilities did not provide adequate quantity of water as demonstrated by the long ques
met at the sites. The MWR standard for adequate water supply87 is maximum 250 persons per water
point. The proportions of inspected facilities providing an adequate supply was five in ten in Bonthe, one
in seven in Falaba, and none of the three in Koinadugu. 88
Addressing the needs of women and vulnerable groups
The views of survey respondents on whether or not the ASWA-SL addressed their needs, were mixed, with
the higher percentage was those being satisfied. With the exception of communities in which the project
was not fully implemented, survey respondents found ASWA-SL successful in addressing their needs,
especially in providing access to water. However, the number of facilities were considered to be
inadequate. In Bonthe, community leaders expressed satisfaction of the implementation of the project.
District stakeholders confirmed that the program was successful in achieving the planned results.
Some responses from communities identified the following in relation to addressing the needs of the
various groups:
Women: Women are traditionally responsible for fetching water which was reiterated by responses in
FGDs. The installed water points were found to reduce the time and energy spent on fetching water. The
access to family latrines and potable water supply within safe proximity reduced incidences of gender-
based violence (GBV). While the training on GBV for the communities likely contributed to this, the critical
factor was the location of the latrines and water access. Women also benefitted from access to finance

109
from VSLAs. Ninety women were trained to become water point caretakers. They were also paid for their
unskilled labour, such as cooking for technicians working on the installation of WASH facilities. The
women’s access to this livelihood was commented by the community level respondents to increase
women’s wellbeing.
Men: Some men were trained and secured jobs as hand pump or solar pump mechanics or masons for
latrine construction. Gender roles and stereotypes were reinforced where it was reported that women
were not interested in masonry training “because it was heavy work”. There was no attempt by any IPs to
actively recruit and train women into these positions. Men were paid for unskilled labour for installation
of WASH facilities. In some communities, men were also paid for the provision of local materials.
Girls: Initially, the exploitation of girls was a major problem in communities but the sensitization and
training of girls and their mothers on sexual exploitation reportedly minimized this significantly. WASH
Committees specified periods for getting water and those allowed to fetch water are guided by certain
bylaws to protect girls from harassment and sexual exploitation. Like women, girls benefitted from
reduced distance and travel time for fetching water, and access to clean water and latrines in safe
locations. Girls were also provided with access to separate toilets, menstrual hygiene facilities and free
menstrual pads at schools, which was seen by respondents to reduce their absence rates as well as stigma
during menstruation, although the evaluation did not have access to data on school attendance and
absenteeism to verify this. AWSA-SL also improved the confidence of pupils through their participation in
training and in clubs.
Boys: Like girls, boys benefitted from reduced distance and travel time for fetching water, and access to
clean water and latrines in safe locations.
People living with disabilities: WASH facilities and toilet facilities at schools were built with ramps for
ease of use by people living with disabilities. The reduced distance to water points also facilitated their
access to water, although it was reported that most people with disabilities rarely fetch water from water
points themselves. The standard of the most affordable household latrines continues to pose an access
challenge for persons with disabilities, since these typically are without a firm floor, which would allow
for wheelchair access.
Elderly: The elderly also benefitted from the proximity and ease of access to water points and household
toilets. However, it was reported that most elderly rarely fetch water from water points themselves.
Ultra-poor households: Ultra-poor households were prioritized for VSLA membership and financial
support. IPs states in their comment to ultra-poor households’ involvement and accessing WASH facilities
in their ‘no-one-left-behind’ approach has in addition emphasised, that they also ensure special attention
is given in the facilitation of VSLA to enable them to be active participant in these schemes.
Key findings related to EQ22:
FINDING 22.1 : Data collected at the community level suggests that IP’s strategies were inclusive, and
interventions were guided by a “leave no one behind” ethos, however a lack of tracking of disaggregated
data inhibits this finding.
FINDING 22.2: A full picture of the extent to which vulnerable groups were reached was not possible to
establish due to limited disaggregated data in reporting on achievements in relation to different groups.
110
FINDING 22.3: The school latrines and water points are located sufficiently close to school buildings to be
safe to use during school hours. All community water points are located within or very close to settled
areas and safe to use, especially during daylight.
9.5.3 EQ23 GEHR – equity gaps
How have identified equity gaps during design changed over the program lifespan? What is the
contribution of the program to these changes?
Changes in equity gaps
As shown in Figure 9-13, access to water and sanitation services as well as handwashing facilities in the
ASWA-SL target districts is approaching national averages, with coverage improvements from 2010 to
2017 being significantly larger in the two districts than the national averages for rural areas, indicating a
contribution from ASWA-SL to narrowing equity gaps. However, the national equity gap between urban
and rural areas remains and has even grown on some parameters.
While the focus of ASWA-SL was in rural areas, WASH was also addressed in communities with more than
2,000 persons, which can be considered as both rural and urban, depending on the sectoral definition
applied89. Table 9-7 shows the ASWA water in communities project areas, based on the communities listed
in the data available from UNICEF on the ASWA-SL target communities in relation to the categories of
settlements used in the water sector. So while the focus of the ASWA-SL is in rural areas, 60% of the
population appears to be in settlements falling in urban areas according to the SSL definition of rural areas.
The ASWA-SL achievements on improved WASH services would therefore not reflect on closing the rural/
urban equity gap.
Table 9-7: ASWA Projects and MWR Settlement Categories
89 SSL statistics on socio-economic conditions in Sierra Leone define rural areas as settlements with population of
less than 2,000 persons while the water sector considers rural areas as settlements with a population up to 5,000
persons.

Figure 9-13: Access to WASH services in 2010 and 201790
Key findings related to EQ23:
FINDING 23.1 : WASH access in the ASWA-SL target districts is approaching national averages for districts,
thereby reducing the equity gap between districts in Sierra Leone.
FINDING 23.2: Stakeholders find that ASWA-SL by using the ‘reaching all’ approaches succeeded in
reducing community-level equity gaps in terms of women’s and other vulnerable groups’ access to WASH
services.
9.5.4 EQ24 GEHR – integration of education and child protection
How strong was the integration of education and child protection with WASH programming and what
were the successful integration strategies used?91
Integration of education and child protection
The integration of education and child protection strategies with WASH programming was informal at the
strategic level, although there is evidence that IPs used their own expertise to apply child protection
strategies. For example, one IPs indicated using sensitization messages to promote the importance of
90 Based on data from the SSL Multi-Indicator Cluster Surveys. MICS5 is the first time that comprehensive data have
been collected on combined WASH services, so the 2010 figures shown in the graph are determined from the access
to combined water and sanitation combined with data on practicing handwashing.
91 The findings for this EQ were largely from KIIs conducted, supported by survey data.
112
school attendance to parents and positive messages around gender-based violence, child exploitation,
forced labour, and child protection. The responses from communities and IPs indicate that the IPs ensured
that no child labour was used in the implementation of the programme.
Appropriate vehicles for disseminating messages were used, e.g. pair-to-pair support in SHCs or direct
mediation with parents to promote school attendance. A complaints mechanism system was established
for sexual and gender-based violence . IPs were guided through UNICEF’s policies and code of conduct on
safeguarding and child protection. Most IPs reported internal child protection policies consistent with
UNICEF’s and international standards and requirements when dealing with children. Some excerpts from
communities:
− “We ensure that we call for children who are minors; we ensure that we got their consent through
the parent or guardians. For example, if we want to take pictures; they sign consent when it comes to
sanitation expose. We also ensure the child protection is also fundamental, safe guiding issues are
considered. All the people we are working with, be it suppliers, need to sign code of conduct, safe
guiding, and child protection policy for OXFAM. Part of the intervention that we do, we normally
conduct DO NO HARM to communities to ensure that they are also enlightened.”
− “CEDA has internal child protection policies. We have a gender, child protection and safeguard policy,
staff code of conduct and compulsory reporting policy based on sexual exploitation and misuse of
funds. These policies safeguard children and other vulnerable groups CEDA employees work with.
CEDA Staff are orientated on these policies and required to sign the staff code of conduct before
implementation.”
Information on GBV and menstrual hygiene was reportedly mainstreamed in all programme activities (e.g.
training for SMC, Water Committees, SHCs, VSLAs) and was emphasized in all community meetings and
engagements, to highlight the seriousness and prevention of sexual exploitation of girls, boys, women,
and other vulnerable groups in the community. Some of the responses from District stakeholders and
communities on education and child protection in general included the following:
− District stakeholders reported that meetings were held to sensitise the communities about sexual
exploitation of girls, boys, and women.
− The DHMTs conducted trainings on prevention of sexual exploitation for women and children,
especially girls.
− The enforcement of community bylaws in the use of WASH facilities also helped to protect children
and women from abuse. These measures were reported to be effective in reducing the incidence of
GBV in the community.
− Community leaders were aware of laws designed to ensure that women and children are protected.
− Community leaders/youth groups said that youth were being advised on the danger associated with
sex at an early age, as well as awareness on the need to refrain from going to the streams alone or
fetching water at night.
− Community members, especially women and children, are reportedly outspoken on sexual
exploitation and GBV. However the fact that some IPs believed that establishing community dress
codes would help in preventing sexual exploitation illustrates that their lack of understanding of GBV
and reinforces gender norms and stereotypes.
− Community leaders recommended that awareness raising on sexual and GBV should be ongoing, and
they recommended that a GBV coordination team should be established at community and chiefdom
levels. They wanted improved IEC materials on sexual exploitation to be widely rolled out.
113
Key findings related to EQ24:
FINDING 24.1: The integration of education and child protection strategies with WASH programming was
informal at the strategic level, but local implementing partners used their own expertise to contribute to
child protection strategies. Examples include advocacy for setting-up of child complain committees at
community levels.
FINDING 24.2: Responses from community and district stakeholders indicate that awareness has been
raised concerning the importance of addressing GBV with evidence of high level of awareness across
groups including chiefs and elders, women, and youth.
9.5.5 EQ25 GEHR addressing gender equity and sexual exploitation.
How and to what extent did UNICEF and partners’ interventions contribute to addressing gender equity
issues and the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse?92
Women groups and IPs mentioned that the provision of WASH services within the communities and
schools in itself was a measure for protecting children, since they no longer had to risk going to distant
places to fetch water or the bush to go to the toilet. The water collection points were located centrally,
thereby reducing the risk of sexual advances on children and women. Construction of more facilities and
the continual maintenance of facilities to ensure uninterrupted water access would thus further ensure
child protection.
Change in workloads.
The community respondents indicate that it was traditionally and continue to be women and girls who
are mainly responsible for fetching water in the households. In the schools however, fetching water and
cleaning of the toilets is a shared responsibility between the boys and girls.
92 Sources of evidence: KIIs, ASWA Progress and Final Reports

Figure 9-14: Water collection time
The time spent on fetching water in
Bonthe district was reduced from 19.2
minutes in 2016 according to the district
level baseline data to 16.5 minutes in
2020 as indicated by the end-line survey
data or a 14% reduction. The
corresponding data from Koinadugu/
Falaba show a 20% reduction from 23.9
minutes to 19.2 minutes. Overall the
collection time was reduced from 21.5
minutes in 2016 to 17.5 minutes in 2020.
Data on distance to water sources are
not available from the baseline data, but the end-line survey data indicate that 50.4% of users in Bonthe
and 63.1% of the users in Koinadugu/ Falaba are within 500 m distance of the water sources. The end-line
data also show that 86% of the households in Bonthe and 77% of the households in Koinadugu/ Falaba
(82% of all households in ASWA-SL target communities) access water within 30-minutes of walking and
queuing.
These figures indicate that the time spent on collecting water was reduced by approximately 18%.
Control over finances
As also described under EQ10, women reported that their participation with the village savings and loans
associations (VSLA) improved their access to and control over financing, incomes, and assets, and
provided them with income-generation opportunities. This, in turn, enhanced women’s influence on
decision-making at community and household levels, including resource mobilisation decisions. 62% of
the VSLA members were women. At the programme conclusion, 90 community groups (25 persons per
group) were trained on community-based resource mobilisation for WASH O&M through VSLAs, with
resources generated to pay for minor repairs.
Women’s participation in decision-making
ASWA-SL promoted women's participation in community and decision-making, but the extent to which
the participation led to influence is less clear. The programme used traditional approaches to address
women’s participation – for instance, in CLTS, the two “natural leaders” identified in each community
ensured equal gender representation, and similarly, women’s representation was ensured in WASH
Committees. The programme aimed at ensuring that WASH Committees had at least one-third
representation of women. In practice, 55% of the WASH Committee members were women. 54% of the
School Management Committee members were women. Moreover, female water point caretakers were
trained (90 women and 136 men were trained), challenging gender stereotypes. However, Chiefs provided
overall leadership, particularly with sanitation and hygiene activities, and within traditional structures
women are seldomly represented as leaders.
Voice of children
Women confirmed that children’s awareness of hygiene had improved, as had their ability to voice their
needs thereby influencing parents’ WASH decision. It was confirmed that children share hygiene
knowledge gained in schools with parents both in general and at the home..
115
Roles of boys and girls
Ninety% of the community leaders, who are mainly elderly and male, responded that women and girls are
mainly responsible for fetching water and cleaning in the homes. However, some youth groups said that
both the girls and boys are responsible, indicating that there is some generational change in the
perception of roles in the households.
The overall responses have indicated that some change in gender roles have occurred. The change can
be seen to be generational as the perception is that it is the youth who change attitudes. However, it is
still seen to be the primary responsibility of girls to fetch water, with only one member our of 49 saying
that boys and girls both fetch water.
“At home, the girls are responsible to fetch water and clean the home”. “The girls fetch water. But if you
have a brother, sometimes they will help you”. "Girls fetch water more compared to boys". Only one
member of the seven groups of about 49 members states that: “We all fetch water at home, boys and
girls before we come to school and after school as well”.
Risk of sexual exploitation and abuse
UNICEF assessed IPs for potential risks in the context of Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse
(PSEA) and there were compliance measures for IPs. UNICEF ensured that IPs complied with PSEA codes
of conduct. IPs were trained by UNICEF staff to ensure that WASH facilities were provided in a way that
did not exploit girls and women, reduced their vulnerability to PSEA and communities were consulted to
identify safe locations for latrines. IPs were trained on community sensitization (e.g. on not fetching water
at night) and were made aware of UNICEF’s PSEA guidelines. IPs were supported in ensuring that WASH
facilities were located in open and accessible places and with segregated male and female facilities.
Community/ school sensitisation and awareness raising addressed PSEA, and IPs reported high awareness
of PSEA in target communities. There was no report of sex-for-access to WASH from any IP. The locations
of water points were agreed by target beneficiaries. Observations showed that the water points were
openly and centrally located to prevent sexual exploitation of the vulnerable.
The extent to which ASWA-SL led to a change in the risk of sexual exploitation abuse is not possible to
determine, due to the sensitivity of the topic and difficulty in collecting data. Nonetheless, responses from
stakeholders indicate that the provision of water points and toilet facilities in safe locations contributed
to reduced risk of sexual exploitation and abuse, by the provision of water facilities in schools and
communities.
“poor assess to water, sanitation, has put girls and women at risk of sexual harassment in this our Jahun
community. There have been cases of harassment reported to the chief and local authority by some school
children and their parents. ASWA contributed significantly to the protection of children (girls and boys)
and women, against sexual exploitation and abuse by providing water facilities in some schools and
communities. Vulnerable groups like women, girl’s child no longer going to secluded places more far and
hard to reach areas to fetch water”.
National framework and disadvantaged groups
National WASH stakeholders commented that the ASWA supported the revision of the WASH guidelines,
which now recommend at least 40% participation of women in WASH Committees and that either the
116
chair or vice chair should be a woman. In addition, Persons Living with Disabilities (PLwD) are now required
to participate in WASH planning and WASH facilities should be disability friendly.
District stakeholders commented that the policies, regulations, and guidelines contained clearly defined
objectives through continuous community engagement with various groups like the youth, women’s
groups and people living with disabilities. Their needs were included as part of the objectives in the
management of WASH facilities. They also address some of the sanitation challenges at community levels,
awareness of community roles and responsibilities, taking over ownership of sanitation services. The
needs of women and vulnerable groups were also specifically addressed in WASH policies in terms of
access to WASH facilities.
Some IPs found that national WASH guidelines previously were below standard and ASWA-SL’s
contribution led to improved guidelines for WASH in schools. However, the majority of IPs were unaware
of ASWA-SL’s support to the development of WASH policies, regulations, and guidelines. Some IPs stated
that it was not the responsibility for ASWA-SL to revise national WASH policies as this was the
responsibility of GoSL.
Key findings related to EQ25:
FINDING 25.1: Stakeholders appreciated of the awareness raising and the knowledge they have gained on
the issues of sexual exploitation at community, chiefdom, and district levels.
FINDING 25.2: Positive results were achieved in terms of reducing the work-load for collection of water,
women’s control of finances through the VSLAs, female representation and participation in decision-
making, as well as the perception of the roles of girls and boys.
FINDING 25.3: UNICEF and ASWA-SL had a positive impact on the inclusion of gender equity, child
protection and the participation of vulnerable groups in the sector guidelines and policy documents.

9.6.1 EQ26 Impact – lasting change in well-being
What are the lasting changes in the lives and wellbeing of women, children, families, and communities
targeted by the program?
The underlying rationale for ASWA-SL’s was that a) improved accessed to WASH would lead to decreased
child mortality and morbidity, and b) improved access to WASH in schools would lead to better education
outcomes due to reduced absenteeism and improved enrolment. However, it is difficult to attribute the
impact of ASWA-SL on health and education as there were several factors external to ASWA-SL influencing
the health and school attendance in the target areas; some were obstacles, such as the Ebola epidemic,
whereas other were enablers, such as education sector reforms aiming at universal access to primary
education.
Achievement of health targets
No statistical/ quantitative data is available on the prevalence of diarrhoea and other hygiene-related
diseases or under-five mortality in ASWA-SL target communities. Nonetheless, there is a widespread
perception in the communities that the improved access to water, discontinuation of open defecation,
and improved hygiene practices brought about by ASWA-SL contributed significantly to a decrease in
cholera, diarrhoea and other waterborne and hygiene-related diseases and deaths and improved
wellbeing among under-five as well as community-members. However, community members found that
deaths amongst children due to diarrhoea, which they believe is due to poor water quality, still persist.
The national under-five mortality rate in Sierra Leone has decreased over the years as shown in Figure 2-1
and Figure 9-15.
118
Figure 9-15: Under-5 mortality rates93
DHMT in Koinadugu reported that the weekly data obtained from
the integrated Disease Surveillance System confirmed the national
trend also applied to Koinadugu. Prior to 2012, there were
outbreaks of childhood diseases, and after 2012 there was a
reduction in the incidence of waterborne diseases, which DHMT
found was probably due to increased accessed to WASH facilities.
In Bonthe, there is no data available for under-five and general
diarrhoea and other waterborne and hygiene related diseases
morbidity and mortality. Stakeholders also mentioned that the
cause of death is often difficult to ascertain, and it is thus difficult
to assert that the presence of WASH facilities resulted in the
reduction of under-five deaths in Bonthe.
Reduction in time spent on collecting water.
ASWA-SL has had a positive impact on the time for collecting water by users in the target districts. The
average collection time was reduced with approximately 18%. Baseline data is not available on the
distance to water points, but the end-line data indicate that the proportion of users within 500m from the
water sources are approximately 50% in Bonthe and 63% in Koinadugu/ Falaba.
Change in school absenteeism and attendance.
Data on school absence and attendance rates for ASWA-SL target schools were not made available to the
evaluation team. Typical responses from stakeholders were that attendance rates increased in recent
years due to reforms in the education sector94, rather than due to ASWA-SL.
Stakeholders have the impression that the school absenteeism was reduced due to better access to WASH
facilities. Some teachers found that prior to ASWA-SL, the time spent by pupils to fetch water affected
school attendance, and that the WASH facilities had reduced absence: “We used to send school pupils to
fetch water from far distances, but the situation is better now with implementation of WASH program in
the school”.
Sustainability of CLTS achievements
While IP confirmed that they achieved their target ODF communities they are concerned that the time
available to upgrade open defecation to ODF is not sufficient to sustain this holistic behavioural change.
In effect, CLTS interventions like most other rural WASH project should ideally include a stabilisation phase
to empower communities to fully own, manage and derived sufficient benefits from the results of the
interventions. In most cases, central and/ or local governments are expected to fill in this gap but for all
intent and purposes, the limited resources at the local level do not permit such aftercare on interventions.
There is thus a risk of communities reverting to open defecation and/ or limit households to move up the
93 Statistics Sierra Leone Demographic and Health Survey 2019
94 Data from the Education MIS from 2018 and 2019 show an increase in primary school enrolment in the three

difference in the ratio between boys and girls in primary schools.

sanitation ladder over and above their first unimproved condition, which is necessary but not sufficient
to achieve safe-sanitation and the desired target of the SDGs.
Key findings related to EQ26:
FINDING 26.1 : While it is difficult to quantify changes in health and living standards, stakeholders agree
that health conditions, in particular related to water borne diseases and living standards in terms of
reduced workload for collecting water were affected positively by ASWA-SL.
FINDING 26.2: Communities and health personnel observed substantial reductions in hygiene-related
illnesses and mortality in general and for under-five children in particular.
FINDING 26.3: ASWA-SL reduced the time used for fetching water by 18%.
FINDING 26.4: Stakeholders find that school absenteeism has reduced due to better access to WASH
facilities, but this cannot be quantified.

To what extent has the program contributed to improving the provision of WASH by the government at
national and district levels?95
Contribution to improving the WASH Sector Governance Framework
Stakeholders report the following contributions from UNICEF and ASWA-SL to improvements in the WASH
Sector Governance Framework:
- The guidelines developed with ASWA-SL support for WASH in schools and WASH in health facilities
considered the needs of persons living with disabilities.
- The National Protocol on CLTS and the WASH Sustainability Compact developed with ASWA-SL
support defined participation and clear roles for women.
- The National Strategy on Sanitation and Hygiene outlined strategies for promoting menstrual hygiene
management. UNICEF supported/ funded MoHS to develop the strategy.
- The flexibility allowed ASWA-SL to engage in innovative experimentation in the support to GoSL, such
as digital monitoring. This helped GoSL developing a new policy on digital monitoring. Moreover, the
National Plan Strategy for Water Safety Planning (November 2020) was in part development based on
ASW-SL’s digital monitoring experience, all the issues brought out from the monitoring; policy
guidelines on iron removal on some of the water facilities and many documents.
- Some stakeholders suggested that the national level capacity building activities under ASWA-SL led to
the launch of policies outside the confines of the programme. ASWA-SL also contributed to the
development of the urban WASH policy (although stakeholders indicate that the contribution was
modest), and the ongoing review of the WASH sector policy. The capacity development provided by
ASWA-SL helped strengthening SWA engagement.

120
At the district level, stakeholders reported that capacities improved in the three districts targeted as a
result of ASWA-SL involving District Councils in monitoring and implementation. Bonthe and Koinadugu
districts received direct funding on annual basis, so they could work hand in hand with the IPs. However,
the communities remarked that there were very few or no visits from the district officials to the
communities. The lack of water point mapping data on the ASWA-SL completed facilities also indicate less
than optimal involvement of the district WASH teams in monitoring and implementation.
Stakeholders and one IP reported that the national WASH governance and coordination was much more
effective during emergencies such as the Ebola but less effective and useful for normal implementation
of programmes such as ASWA-SL. Some IPs mentioned that governance amongst WASH MDAs at district
level has changed as there is now active coordination and collaboration in project implementation.
However, the IPs mentioned that they are unaware of ASWA-SL significantly contributing to any changes/
improvements in WASH sector governance nationally or at district level.
Government WASH funding
An impact of ASWA-SL on the level of WASH funding at national or district level cannot be established.
The WASH sector remains dominated by external funding. Like other developing countries, GoSL’s own
resources are inadequate, and the presence of external funding is likely to result in allocating own funding
to other underfunded sectors. Nonetheless, one MDA representative said: “ASWA contribution to change
in Government WASH funding – I think so, although I don’t have much evidence to substantiate it. I am
aware UNICEF and other donors have been putting pressure for Government to contribute more on the
WASH services in country”.
District stakeholders noted the inadequate funding for follow-up and monitoring activities. For example,
there is no budget at district level to support CLTS and hygiene promotion. At the national level there is
only the ‘Expanded Sanitary Inspection & Compliance’ (ESICOME) programme, which filters down to the
district level for CLTS.
Changes in mandates and roles
The national WASH stakeholders responded that the WASH sector governance framework is generally
based on the WASH Policy (2010), and the 2004 Local Government Act. This governance framework is
distinct and clear with the roles of MDAs and decentralised activities. MDAs at national level provide
strategic guidance and oversight of rural WASH, with no direct implementation responsibilities. The local
councils are directly responsible for managing and coordinating implementation and O&M of rural WASH,
in collaboration with the District MDA such DHMT, MWR Engineers, and MBESS. This governance
framework has not changed.
National MDAs expressed concern about not being involved in the oversight and quality control, and not
being fully informed by district stakeholders about what goes on and what should be done to improve the
situation.
Some of the responses from national stakeholders point to that the ASWA-SL did not have impact on the
mandates, roles, and responsibilities in the WASH sector as such, but that the programme and UNICEF has
contributed substantially to developing the details of the mandates in particular in relation to CLTS
implementation and ensuring focus on gender, children, and vulnerable groups.
121
Key findings related to EQ27:
FINDING 27.1: Stakeholders found the ASWA-SL had contributed to improving national WASH governance
in particular through the support to WASH M&E and the National Strategy on Sanitation and Hygiene.
FINDING 27.2: Government funding for WASH from internal sources remains low and stakeholders
responses indicate that ASWA-SL did not influence Government funding allocations to rural WASH
significantly.
FINDING 27.3: The mandates in the WASH sector have not changed over the last decade years as these
are outlined in the NWSP. However, stakeholders found that ASWA-SL supported the operationalization
of the mandates, in particular vis-à-vis sanitation and coordination at district level.

10 Lessons Learned
Lesson 1. It is important to understand behavioural changes to ensure that the participatory and
inclusive approaches lead to programme sustainability. Without incremental changes in behavioural
change being monitored and analysed with intent, it can be difficult to plan evidence based
sustainability strategies.
Related observations: ASWA-SL’s reporting in part captured incremental behavioural change, for instance
in narrative of annual reports. However, the reporting did not clearly reflect the milestones that lead up
to changes on the ground when it comes to behaviour change. This could lead to result indicators that are
clearly captured in the monitoring framework (e.g. number of ODF communities, handwashing practices
etc.). Also, the IPs made great efforts to include vulnerable groups, with continuous re-orientation to keep
up momentum, but these efforts were not fully captured in reporting. Analysis could be clearer on how
different interrelated factors have influenced behaviour change, which in turn will inform sustainability.
This lesson is drawn from KIIs and discussions with partners and UNICEF staff, and supported by analysis
from EQs REL 2, REL 3, GEHR 21, GEHR 22 and GEHR 23.
Lesson 2. The insights of communities are essential for understanding the needs and barriers of the
most vulnerable and how they can be reached and should therefore be integrated in program
monitoring and systematically be taped into.
Related observations: At the community level, there are specific insights on the vulnerability of different
segment of the local population, which segments are the most vulnerable, and how they can be reached.
Community voices and actors in schools have shed light on their ability to pay for services, and to fund
running costs (O&M) in the communities and schools reached. These views appear to be more nuanced
than views at the national level. More insightful and intensive strategies are needed to improve outcomes
for extremely vulnerable people.
This lesson is drawn from the assessment of REL 2 and 3 GEHR EQs.
Lesson 3. Access to information and data is essential for effective and evidence-based decision-making
and coordination – a complete, systematic, and GEHR sensitive monitoring, analysis and record keeping
of activities and completed facilities are essential for identifying areas requiring improvement and
enabling results-based program management.
Related observations: Monitoring provides managers with an understanding of problems as they occur
and allows adjustments and corrections to be made to procedures. Record keeping, including accurate
location data for facilities, also provides evidence for accountability to donors and provides a resource for
future implementation by all actors. Although UNICEF and the ASWA-SL spearheaded development of
WASH M&E tools, such as the Akvo mobile phone data collection tools, these seem not to have been used
as management tools to ensure accurate data on ASWA-SL achievements. Despite funding provided to
District WASH teams for monitoring, no data on the facilities that were constructed under ASWA-SL is
available on the national data platforms. UNICEF did not have a complete list of the localities where the
ASWA-SL activities were implemented. This makes follow-up difficult for UNICEF and the District WASH
Teams and generally does not facilitate coordination and planning at district level when data on the WASH
situation in the communities is not available.
123
This lesson is drawn from general problems experienced to access data on the ASWA-SL target
communities and facilities.
Lesson 4. Careful attention to ensuring the quality of surveys and designs for each individual water
system is essential for ensuing fully functional and sustainable water systems.
Related observations: The field observations of ASWA-SL supported water systems indicated that the
capacity was insufficient for i) siting of hand-dug wells and boreholes to reduce the serious problems with
seasonality of water facilities using shallow groundwater; and ii) survey and design of piped systems. The
issues related to the technical quality of water facilities experienced in the ASWA-SL implementation are
well known in the sector in Sierra Leone, and more attention to these issues is needed to reverse the trend
of not using the limited available funding effectively to develop perennial and sustainable access to water.
It would be preferable if the capacity and role of the IPs used by UNICEF focused on systematic building
of the private sector’s capacity to provide quality services as outlined in the NRWSSP.
The technological advances in the accuracy of satellite navigations systems provide an opportunity for
UNICEF, the IPs, and the water sector generally to further develop easy and accurate survey tools for piped
systems as already applied by other implementers in Sierra Leone.
These lessons are based on the experiences from the visit to the ASWA-SL target communities as presented
in detail in Appendix 7 Facilities Observations Checklist – Technical Narrative.
Lesson 5. Achieving sustained benefits in terms of improved health and living standards require
combined access to water and sanitation and good hygiene practices/ behavioural changes.
Related observations: It seems obvious at a theoretical level that only when a household have sustained
access to water, and proper sanitation facilities and practice good hygiene will the improvements have
the desired impacts on health and living standards. However, implementing this in practice can be
challenging. The national statistics as well as the results of the end-line survey carried out in ASWA-SL
target communities indicate that a very small proportion of the households in Sierra Leone have combined
access to all three WASH components.
The approach to selecting communities for investments in water facilities seems to have favoured
spreading the benefits to as many communities as possible. While this is commendable, in particular as
an emergency response, the ASWA-SL experiences seem to indicate that this can result in the few
installations being over-used and therefore difficult to maintain as they are serving a large population.
In light of the logistic challenges also experienced by ASWA-SL, it could be considered if a more
comprehensive approach could be implemented in target communities in order to move towards
achieving the WASH SDGs. This would imply that a community is fully covered with perennial and
sustainable access to the three WASH components before moving on to the next community. The area
wide approach of intervention planned to be introduced by UNICEF that consider an entire Chiefdom as
one unit for sanitation and hygiene promotion supports this but would need to also consider planning for
water services.
ASWA-SL achieved good results in reducing open defecation in the target communities using the CLTS
approach, where households invest in facilities they can afford. The ASWA-SL data shows that this is
predominantly in the lower steps of the sanitation ladder and to move forward towards achieving the
124
SDGs for sanitation, a more sustained effort is needed. Whether this can be achieved through continued
support to VLSAs or subsidy for the poorest households could be something UNICEF with the national
stakeholders could investigate.
125
11 Final Conclusions
11.1 Relevance
Conclusion 1.1: ASWA-SL fitted well in national policy framework and goals and UNICEF’s global
approach.
In terms of programme scope and approach, ASWA-SL is an exemplar of integrated rural WASH
programming. The programme fitted clearly within Sierra Leone’s national policy framework and goals, as
well as within UNICEF’s global approach to WASH. ASWA-SL clearly contributed toward achieving the
sustainable development agenda and highlighted very strong arguments for the inclusion of WASH into
overarching strategies. In part, the high degree of alignment was supported by the programme models
promoted including CLTS, WinS approaches (including the Child Friendly Schools approach) and Village
Level Operation and Maintenance (VLOM). These approaches were refined and promoted by UNICEF
WASH programme globally, and the design of ASWA-SL took into account the global lessons learned.
Reference: REL EQ1
Conclusion 1.2: ASWA responded to the needs of vulnerable groups however with opportunities for
improvement.
ASWA-SL design responded to specific needs of different groups such as women, men, children, and
vulnerable groups such as people living with disabilities and the elderly as well as targeting needy
communities. ASWA-SL responded well to the needs of women and children e.g. in the provision of WASH
facilities in safe locations and reducing workload for collecting water.
Specific attention to people living with disabilities at community/ household level could have been paid
to the strategies required to reach vulnerable groups which are often the most difficult to reach and
require different strategies. One example is the attention paid to the needs of adolescent girls in planning
stages, which was rectified at later stages of the programme by the inclusion of menstrual hygiene
approaches. This later rectification could have been avoided if earlier planning had paid closer attention
to specific needs of sub-groups. Nonetheless, the programme models implemented to promote inclusion
are widely known for including vulnerable groups (i.e. CLTS with its “whole of community” approach)..
Reference: REL EQ2, EQ3, EQ4
Conclusion 1.3: Lack of clarity of in Theory of Change and indicator definitions.
The intervention strategy’s link to outcomes and impact was weak, and more could have been done to
link the intended results to programme activities in the specific context. Clarity of the strategy and
framework linking activities and outputs to the intended results (outcomes and impact) in the ToC and
results framework was lacking, and programme assumptions were not clearly identified. There was a lack
of clarity on the indicator definitions for measuring achievements and different wordings were used in
programme document and progress reports. Reference: REL EQ5
11.2 Effectiveness
Conclusion 2.1 ASWA-SL achieved good results in a challenging environment.
Broadly, the targets were reported to be reached or even exceeded; however, lack of clarity of the
indicator definitions and findings from the field indicate that the achievements could in reality be less
than reported. The reported achievements went beyond targets, although the evaluation team finds that
the targets were originally set low. ASWA-SL was successful in raising awareness on hygiene and reducing
126
open defecation in the communities, as well as improving WASH facilities and hygiene in schools.
However, findings from field indicate issues with the sustainability of the water facilities, with some
facilities not functioning or being seasonal. The combined access to all three WASH components remains
low, though this is not one of the indicators under the project. Reference: EFFE EQ7 and QEQ8, EQ9
Conclusion 2.2: The extent to which ASWA-SL contributed to creating enabling environment for the
WASH sector in Sierra Leone is less clear.
ASWA-SL’s contribution to the national WASH governance framework and capacities is appreciated by
stakeholders, in particular in relation to the sector M&E and the sanitation and hygiene strategies.
However the attribution of ASWA-SL to national sector building activities is not clear and reporting does
not indicate the level of collaboration with sector partners. ASWA-SL made a tangible contribution to
improving monitoring and district level coordination of the rural WASH sector in Sierra Leone. Reference:
EFFE EQ8.
Conclusion 2.3: Functional systems for O&M of community and school facilities have generally been put
in place; however field observations identify challenges with functionality of water points.
National systems to promote sustainability were built, yet challenges persist at the community and school
level in capacities to sustain systems, despite a willingness to maintain WASH facilities. Many of these
challenges relate to the limited ability to generate required revenues for operation and maintenance and
limited support from Districts. Similarly, while awareness was greatly enhanced in target communities,
sustained behavioural change remains a concern. Reference EFFE EQ10
11.3 Efficiency
Conclusion 3.1: ASWA-SL implemented efficiently with reasonable unit costs.
Overall, ASWA-SL was implemented efficiently with the reported unit costs within reasonable limits;
although the per capita unit costs cannot be firmly established due uncertainty about the number of
people served. Reference EFFI EQ13
Conclusion 3.2: The resources available for the ASWA-SL implementation were adequate but challenges
with resources for effective support at the district level.
The resources available for the ASWA-SL implementation were generally adequate, although some
interventions such as piped systems and wells in difficult hydrogeological areas were poorly costed, which
led to implementation challenges. The quality of the facilities construction was generally fair to good, but
there were some areas of gap related to siting of hand-dug wells and design of piped systems.
Coordination at district level generally worked well, with good collaboration with District Councils,
deconcentrated staff from WASH MDAs and other partners active in the districts, however the support
provided by the Districts to the communities and regular monitoring is a challenge. Reference EFFI EQ14
and EQ15.
Conclusion 3.3: ASWA-SL modalities for coordination functioned and satisfaction with UNICEF support
generally expressed by implementers.
Coordination at the national level was working with some coordination between WASH MDAs and
implementing partners although irregular. Despite the irregular formal consultations there appear to be
no overlaps in the target areas for ASWA-SL and other implementing partners or Development Partner
programmes. Implementers broadly expressed satisfaction with the support provided by the UNICEF staff
127
to facilitate implementation. However, UNICEF procurement procedures and late disbursement were
seen by IPs and District stakeholders to cause implementation delays. Opinions from IPs and District WASH
stakeholders on issues related to procurement, pre-financing and timing of funding, points to need for
more transparency and communication on the UNICEF procedures. Reference EFFI EQ17 and EQ18
Conclusion 3.1: Challenges with consistent use of monitoring tools and data on achievements and
completed facilities.
Programme monitoring was not fully satisfactory, the numbers reported were not always fully reliable
due to weaknesses in indicator definitions, and most data was not disaggregated by gender or vulnerable
groups. Accurate data on the targeted communities and completed facilities was not fully available,
despite the fact that UNICEF through ASWA-SL supported the development of national and district WASH
monitoring tools used for water point mapping and also the water quality monitoring tools using mobile
phone technology. Reference EFFI EQ13-17.
11.4 Sustainability
Conclusion 4.1: Overall some success in achieving sustainability of WASH services.
Overall, ASWA-SL had some success in terms of achieving sustainability, as communities are generally
willing to pay for WASH services and pay either on a monthly basis or when there is a need for repairs.
There is evidence that hand pumps are maintained in some communities, although difficulties in accessing
skilled mechanics and spare-parts exists. The ability to pay at the community and school level for O&M
remains insufficient, in particular the ability to pay for replicating household toilets. Reference SUST EQ
19
Conclusion 4.2: Challenges in sustaining gains in sanitation.
The sustainability at the community level, in particular with respect to the sustainability of behavioural
change and maintaining ODF status continues to be a challenge. Also in schools, sanitation facilities are
generally functional, but not well maintained and some School Health Clubs are functional with
participation of both girls and boys. . Reference SUST EQ 19
Conclusion 4.3: Resources in Districts for effective support to WASH remains a challenge.
The approaches around the sustainability framework were commendable and appropriate, but there is
only limited support from district authorities to the communities to continue WASH activities and limited
resources for the Districts to carry out the WASH monitoring and support activities. Reference SUST EQ20.
11.5 Gender, Equity and Human Rights
Conclusion 5.1: ASWA-SL successful in improving balanced gender participation but less so in
participation of persons living with disabilities.
ASWA-SL was successful in ensuring equal participation and representation of women and men in WASH
decision-making and management. However, ASWA-SL was not equally successful in ensuring
representation of vulnerable groups, such as persons living with disabilities. Due to lack of disaggregated
monitoring data, it is however not possible to establish clearly, the extent to which vulnerable groups
were reached by the ASWA-SL activities and achieved improvements in access to WASH services.
Reference GEHR EQ21 and EQ22.
128
Conclusion 5.2: Positive achievements on safety for women and children.
Positive responses were made on the achievements on safety for women and children and awareness of
the importance of addressing GBV. The safety for access to the WASH facilities has improved as the school
latrines and water points are located sufficiently close to school buildings to be safe to use during school
hours and all community water points are located within or very close to settled areas and safe to use,
especially during daylight. However, in localities where water supplies are seasonal, not functioning,
incomplete or inadequate, women, girls and boys still have venture further afield for water.
The integration of education and child protection strategies with WASH programming was informal at the
strategic level, but local implementing partners used their own expertise to contribute to child protection
strategies. Stakeholders also expressed appreciation of the awareness raising on sexual exploitation and
GBV. Reference GEHR EQ22-24.
Conclusion 5.3: Appropriate design of latrines.
The sanitation facilities implemented in schools were appropriate and according to the national standards
with separate toilets for boys and girls and appropriate facilities for disabled access and menstrual
hygiene. Reference GEHR EQ21.
Conclusion 5.4: Equity in WASH access.
In terms of equity in WASH access, the ASWA-SL target districts are approaching national averages for
districts, thereby reducing the equity gap. However, equity gaps in terms of rural/ urban access at national
level are generally widening during the implementation period. Stakeholders find that ASWA-SL
succeeded in reducing community-level equity gaps in terms of women’s and other vulnerable groups’
access to WASH services. Reference GEHR EQ23.
Conclusion 5.5: Reducing workload for collecting of water and gender roles.
Positive results were achieved in terms of reducing the work-load for collection of water, women’s control
of finances through the VSLAs, female representation and participation in decision-making, as well as the
perception of the roles of girls and boys. Reference GEHR EQ25.
Conclusion 5.6: UNICEF’s contribution to inclusion and equity appreciated by stakeholders.
At the national level, stakeholders were of the opinion that UNICEF and ASWA-SL had a positive impact
on the inclusion of gender equity, child protection and the participation of vulnerable groups in the
national sector guidelines and policy documents and in awareness generally at national, district and
community levels. Reference GEHR 24 and 25
11.6 Impact
Conclusion 6.1: Difficult to attribute change in health and living standards to ASWA-SL.
It is not possible clearly to attribute improvements or changes in health conditions to ASWA-SL since major
external factor such as the Ebola pandemic have affected the communities during the implementation,
however the stakeholders generally agree that health conditions and living standards were affected
positively by ASWA-SL. Similarly, the general reforms and improvements in the education sector makes it
difficult to attribute any changes in absenteeism and attendance in schools to the ASWA-SL, however the
stakeholders find that school absenteeism has reduced due to better access to WASH facilities. Reference
IMP EQ26.
129
Conclusion 6.2: Contribution to national WASH governance appreciated but not clearly documented.
Stakeholders commented that ASWA-SL had contributed to improving national WASH governance vis-à-
vis WASH M&E and the National Strategy on Sanitation and Hygiene amongst others while the UNICEF
contribution generally was not well documented. The GoSL funding for WASH from internal sources
remains low and stakeholders expressed that ASWA-SL did not influence funding allocations significantly.
The mandates in the WASH sector have not changed over the last decade years as these are outlined in
the NWSP. However, stakeholders found that ASWA-SL supported the operationalization of the mandates,
in particular vis-à-vis sanitation and coordination at district level. Reference IMP EQ27.
11.7 Summary – ASWA strengths and weaknesses
Strengths: ASWA-SL made a significant direct contribution to improving the access to WASH services in
the districts covered, and indirectly broadly in rural Sierra Leone through its contribution to improving
national capacities. Thereby, ASWA-SL supported the achievement of GoSL’s objectives and SDG targets
of improving WASH coverage and reducing the equity gap. Despite the challenging environment with poor
accessibility and disruption by an Ebola outbreak, ASWA-SL appears to have able to reach or even exceed
its targets, although there are some sustainability issues. Several of the communities covered reached
ODF status. The WASH infrastructure installed was mostly appropriate, of adequate quality, and at
reasonable costs. UNICEF provided good technical support to the IPs, but cumbersome procurement
procedures and late disbursements created implementation delays.
The beneficiaries were reached through a combination of WASH infrastructure, hygiene awareness
raising, and access to micro-finance through VSLAs. Through its integrated approach, ASWA-SL was able
to reach and address the WASH needs of different segments of the population in the target districts,
including women, girls, boys, and people living disabilities, reduce the workload of women and children,
and improve the safety of women and children. In particular, appropriate school WASH facilities for
menstrual hygiene was a prominent contribution. ASWA-SL was also successful in ensuring the
participation of women in WASH decision-making and management. ASWA-SL also ensured a sense of
ownership of the WASH facilities, with communities generally being willing to pay for O&M.
At the national level, ASWA-SL made a moderate contribution to policy improvements (e.g. vis-à-vis
inclusion and child protection in the National Strategy on Sanitation and Hygiene), and a more substantial
contribution to improved WASH sector monitoring and district level coordination.
Weaknesses: The programme strategy did not contain a sufficiently strong results chain linking activities
and outputs to outcomes and impact, and the underlying assumptions of required conditions to achieve
the intended results were not properly identified. A major weakness was the definition of indicators and
the monitoring of progress, which did not obtain sufficiently detailed or clear data on the beneficiaries
reached and achievement of targets, despite ASWA-SL’s support for WASH sector monitoring.
Some of the infrastructure visited by the evaluation team had design or construction weaknesses, and do
not function satisfactorily, or in some cases not at all.
The approach to reach and address the particular needs of vulnerable groups was not sufficiently
comprehensive. While women, children and people living with disabilities were reached, ASWA-SL was
less successful in ensuring the representation of e.g. people living with disabilities in WASH decision-
making.
130
Overall, the ASWA-SL contribution to creating enabling environment for the WASH sector in Sierra Leone
was appreciated by stakeholders but found to be modest and difficult to document.
131
12 Recommendations
Drawing on the findings and conclusions generated in the course of the evaluation, the evaluation team
developed a series of strategic and operational recommendations. The recommendations were developed
in a participatory manner with UNICEF and other in-country partners. Key evaluation users had several
opportunities – once the draft report was submitted for review – to discuss with the evaluation team on
how to make the recommendations relevant, actionable, precise and suitable to the specific context.

Terms of Reference
1. Object of Evaluation
Within the scope of the new UNICEF regional evaluation strategy for West and Central Africa, which aims
to maximize collaboration and learning across CO in the region as well as to reduce transaction costs
associated with the commissioning of
evaluations, this summative evaluation
will focus on two programmes
implemented in two different
countries: the Sanitation component of
the “Hydraulic and Sanitation
Programme for the Millennium”
(PHAM) in Côte d’Ivoire and the
“Accelerating Sanitation and Water for
All (ASWA)” in Sierra Leone. More
details on the two programmes can be
found below.
Programme 1: “Hydraulic and
Figure 25: Map of sites targeted by PHAM
Sanitation Programme for the
Millennium” (PHAM) in Côte d’Ivoire
The sanitation component of the Hydraulic and Sanitation Programme for the Millennium (PHAM) in Côte
d'Ivoire, which is the object of this evaluation, is an integral part of the interventions of the cooperation
programmes (2012-2016 and 2017-2020) between the Government of Côte d'Ivoire and UNICEF in the
area of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH). The overall goal of the PHAM’s sanitation component was
to contribute to equitable and sustainable access of women and children to sanitation and hygiene
services in stability and emergency situation. It was implemented from June 2013 to August 2018 including
a no-cost extension period from June 2017 to August 2018. It targeted 750,000 persons from 1,650 villages
in 8 regions of West and Central West identified based on their high practice of open defecation. The
results of the 2012 DHS-MICS show that more than half of the rural population (56.5%) practiced open
defecation against 5.8% of the urban population. The programme covered localities in the following
142
regions: Cavally, Gbokle, Guemon, Upper Sassandra, Nawa, Marahoue, San Pedro and Tonpki (see Figure
1).
The programme aimed to contribute to the following main results: (i) the elimination of open defecation
in the targeted localities; (ii) the adoption of good hygienic practices such as hand washing and (iii) the
use of improved latrines. It was supporting the government's efforts to reach the contextualized targets
of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG 7). In the sanitation sub-sector, the goal was to increase the
percentage of people with access to improved sanitation to 60%. The project also aimed to contribute in
the longer term to: (i) a better fulfilment of the right of children to a healthy environment; (ii) reducing
inequalities between urban and rural areas regarding sanitation and; (iii) improving the conditions of child
survival and development.
PHAM’s interventions are based on the Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) approach implemented in
three main stages: (i) identification and pre-triggering, (ii) triggering and (iii) post-trigger monitoring. The
main strategies for implementing the programme included: behaviour change communication to generate
sanitation demand and promote adoption of appropriate hygiene and sanitation practices; capacity
building of local actors (bricklayers and youth associations) for the construction of sanitation facilities; and
the strengthening of community dynamics to ensure the involvement of different stakeholders in the
implementation, monitoring and sustainability of the programme’s achievements.
It was co-financed by the European Union and UNICEF. Its implementation was carried out by the
Technical Ministries in charge of sanitation and hygiene and in collaboration with Non-Governmental
Organizations (NGOs), namely International Rescue Committee (IRC), Red Cross Côte d'Ivoire (CRCI),
French Red Cross (CRF) and Panafrican Intergovernmental Water and Sanitation Agency for Africa (EAA).
The PHAM collaborated also with the local leaders who were in charge of community social mobilization
for hygiene behaviour change, the youth associations and bricklayers who contributed to the construction
of latrines, and departmental and village CLTS committees that supported and monitored the process of
eliminating open defecation. The departmental committees included the territorial administration
(prefectures, sub-prefectures), the decentralized bodies of the ministries in charge of sanitation, health
and education and community leaders.
For more details, please look at the PHAM logical framework (Annex 1).

Programme 2: The “Accelerating Sanitation and Water for All” Programme in Sierra Leone
In 2010, data from the WHO/UNICEF
Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP)
indicated that Sierra Leone’s progress
towards achieving key 2015
Millennium Development Goal (MDG)
Water and Sanitation targets was slow
and that the country was at risk of not
meeting the targets. The Sierra Leone
National Water and Sanitation Policy
(NWSP, 2010) had set national targets
for sanitation (66%) and water supply
access (74%) applicable to both rural
and urban areas. The JMP study
indicated there was a wide disparity
between urban and rural access to
improved sources of drinking water. In
rural areas, access to safe water
Figure 26: Map of sites targeted by ASWA (by District)
needed to increase by 28 percentage
points (from 35% to 63%), whilst the access in urban areas was already above the set target. Progress on
sanitation was also off-track. According to the JMP study, to meet the 2015 target, sanitation coverage
needed to increase from 23% to 61% in urban areas and from 6% to 53% in rural areas.
THEORY OF CHANGE
The outcome mapping below illustrates the most likely steps on the pathway to community change and
consequently desired health benefits having an impact on lives of children (Figure 1).
144
Figure 1: ASWA Theory of Change (Sierra Leone)
Assumptions about change resulting in a desired outcome are derived from assessments of prior
interventions on similar strategic approaches in Sierra Leone. These evidence-based assumptions include:
Scaling up CLTS and sanitation marketing (evidence based on CLTS evaluation and Sanitation marketing
study)
1. That community are motivated to commit funds towards sanitation and move up sanitation ladder.
2. That the local councils’ authority on sanitation (DHMT) commit to the process of implementing
sanitation options and creating enabling environment to market sanitation products.
3. That the national government leads the process in revising and implementing the public health
ordinance.

In 2012, UNICEF Sierra Leone in partnership with the government of Sierra Leone (GoSL) commenced
support for the implementation of the “Accelerating Sanitation and Water for All in Sierra Leone
Programme” (ASWA) in a bid to support the country to achieve the WASH-related targets of the MDGs
and the then active Government Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper II (PRSP II). The goal of the programme
is to achieve improved child health, survival rates and well-being and contribute to a reduction of
diarrhoea incidence among children under age of five by accelerating the achievement of MDG 796. The
programme purpose is to accelerate water and sanitation coverage through four major areas of focus,
namely:
▪ Accelerating sanitation and water coverage to meet MDG targets;
▪ Strengthening national sector development;
▪ Institutional strengthening and capacity building; and
▪ Ensuring the sustainability of systems and behaviours.
96 MDG7: Ensure environmental sustainability (specific target: to halve the proportion of the universal population without
sustainable access to clean and safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015)
146
The programme outputs97 are to achieve:
▪ Improved coverage in sustainable rural sanitation and water supply, including both domestic and
institutional (schools and health centres);
▪ Improved drinking water quality;
▪ Improved hand washing and sanitation practices;
▪ Improved hygiene practices amongst students and teachers in rural schools;
▪ Enhanced WASH sector service delivery capacities
Specific interventions at the community level include support towards Community Led Total Sanitation
(CLTS), hand washing with water and soap, access to improved water source and household water
treatment, and WASH in Schools. It used the CLTS approach which was aligned to UNICEF Sierra Leone’s
community engagement strategy for delivering community-based services.
In Sierra Leone, the DGIS WASH program is being implemented in the districts of Bonthe and Koinadugu
(later split into Koinadugu and Falaba).As of April 2019, 150 water points had been rehabilitated,
411,674households reached with water treatment services using approved techniques (chlorine, filter,
boiling, SODIS), 900 communities supported to become open defecation free (ODF), 428 latrines and 214
water points constructed/rehabilitated in 214 schools.
The programme supports the construction/rehabilitation of individual hand dug wells to improve access
to safe water. However in the course of the programme implementation, the method to achieve this
objective was slightly modified to include the drilling of deeper and motorized boreholes with reticulation
systems and capabilities as well as gravity flow schemes to serve surrounding schools, health care facilities
and communities from shared source. The programme ensures the sustainability requirements of WASH
facilities and behaviour change are addressed as outlined in the sustainability compact. It is currently
being implemented by UNICEF, in collaboration with the GoSL, through non-governmental organizations,
local WASH partners and the private sector in the Bonthe, Koinadugu98 and Falaba districts.
The project is scheduled to close in December 2019. UNICEF now seeks the services of an external
evaluation team to carry out the evaluation of the programme.
97 The specific outputs with indicator values are outlined in annex two.
98 Please see map in Annex III
147
The evaluation will focus on interventions supported by UNICEF and implemented by its implementing
partners in the three districts (Koinadugu, Falaba and Bonthe). The evaluation team will be provided with
a real time mapping of all interventions carried out by the UNICEF implementing partners and the program
direct beneficiaries. The team will also be provided with all relevant contractual and programme
documentation including copies of agreements, certificates of completions, training reports, field
monitoring visit reports, quarterly program reports and real-time analysis data from the digital monitoring
platform.
The evaluation will take into consideration the current total population and population groups of interest to
UNICEF in the three districts. The 2015 National Census population projections indicate that in 2019,
Koinadugu (before it was split) will have an estimated total population of 456,140 (226,832 female and
229,308 male); and number of children under age five of 52,214 (25,964 female and 26,250 male). Other
estimates based on the census put children under age one at 18,246, pregnant women at 18,702 and women
of child bearing age at 101,263. The National Census population projections put the 2019 total population
of Bonthe at 219,218 (110,164 female and 109,054 male); and number of children under age five at 30,344
(15,243 female and 15,101 male). Other estimates based on the Census put children under age one at 8,329,
pregnant women at 8,537 and women of child bearing age of 46,224.
Although the evaluation will attempt to gauge the impact of the program on the entire target population, it
will place emphasis on the impact of the program on children (girls and boys) under age five, adolescent
girls and boys, and women. Given this, it will assure the optimal participation of children under age five,
adolescent girls and boys and women by ensuring that their opinions on their priorities needs, and on the
program design, results and challenges are fully captured. The evaluation will also ensure the participation
of other stakeholders including male household heads, out-of-school children, local community leaders,
members of WASH management committees, teachers, school management committee members,
community health workers, health facility staffs, and religious leaders.
2. Evaluation purpose
This summative evaluation has two main goals that are accountability and organizational learning in the
field of sanitation and hygiene for PHAM and water, sanitation and hygiene for ASWA.
▪ In terms of accountability, the evaluation will allow for reporting on the results achieved by the
two programmes vis-à-vis not only the two donors (European Union for PHAM and DGIS for
ASWA) but also the populations that are supposed to benefit from their implementation.
▪ In terms of organizational learning, the purpose of this evaluation is to document good practices
and lessons learned from the implementation of the two programmes to inform decision-making
on scaling up the different approaches adopted during implementation and to formulate new
strategies (or improve existing strategies).

3. Evaluation Objectives
This evaluation aims to achieve the following specific objectives:
▪ Document the achievements and challenges of the sanitation component of the PHAM programme
not only in the two countries where country visits will be conducted (Cote d’Ivoire and Sierrae Leone)
but also among the remaining 8 countries targeted by the DGIS-funded regional programme (these
will be the object of a desk review);
▪ Identify lessons learned at strategic and operational level;
▪ Document good practices in eliminating open defecation;
▪ Formulate recommendations for the consolidation of the gains of the CLTS approach as well as in
respect to scaling up the best practice;
▪ Contribute to the strengthening of national evaluation capacities.
The ASWA evaluation will also pursue the following specific objectives
▪ Assess the extent of coverage of the programme interventions in relation to WASH programme
related needs both in terms of geographic coverage, and numbers of children and women supported
as against numbers of children and women in need.
▪ Assess the quality of the services provided, in relation to relevant national and international
standards, giving special attention to humanitarian and gender quality benchmarks.
▪ Assess the effectiveness of programme partnerships and coordination, particularly between UNICEF
and its implementing partners and all partners working in WASH programming at local, district and
national levels.
▪ Assess the relevance and effectiveness of the various strategies and approaches employed by UNICEF
partners during each stage of the programme life-cycle.
▪ Assess the social appropriateness and acceptability of the programme design and approaches and
explain related beneficiary and stakeholder perceptions in this regard and in terms of the overall
programme.
▪ Assess the extent of programme compliance to the UNICEF policy and guidelines on the prevention
of sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA).

Haut-Sassandra, Nawa, Marahoue, San Pedro and Tonpki.
b. ASWA (Sierra Leone)
In Sierra Leone, the DGIS WASH program is being implemented in the districts of Bonthe and Koinadugu
(later split into Koinadugu and Falaba). As of April 2019, 150 water points had been rehabilitated,
411,674households reached with water treatment services using approved techniques (chlorine, filter,
boiling, SODIS), 900 communities supported to become open defecation free (ODF), 428 latrines and 214
water points constructed/rehabilitated in 214 schools.
The evaluation will focus on interventions supported by UNICEF and implemented by its partners in these
three districts. (.. The evaluation team will be provided with a real time mapping of all interventions carried
out by the UNICEF implementing partners and the programme direct beneficiaries. The team will also be
provided with all relevant contractual and programme documentation including copies of agreements,
certificates of completions, training reports, field monitoring visit reports, and quarterly programme reports.
In addition to the two districts benefiting from the programme, the evaluation will identify other districts
with similar characteristics that have been exposed to WASH interventions coordinated by other
development partners The specific criteria for selection of the comparison districts will be discussed and
agreed on at a later stage.
4.3 Chronological scope
151
a. PHAM (Côte d’Ivoire)
The evaluation will cover programme activities implemented between June 2013 and August 2018 in the
targeted villages.
b. ASWA (Sierra Leone)
The evaluation will cover the period between 2012 (year when the UNICEF Sierra Leone Country Office
started supporting the GoSL in the implementation of the Programme) to December 2019 (end date of
the Programme).
5. Evaluation Context
a. PHAM (Côte d’Ivoire)
Improving hygiene and sanitation conditions is one of Cote d’Ivoire national priorities as well as one of
the development goals pursued both at the regional level (ex. with such initiatives as AfricaSan) and global
level (MDG7 and SDG6). Access to a healthy environment is also one of the widely established and
internationally recognised children’s rights. As part of the initial report on the implementation of the
African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (ACERWC, 2014), a recommendation was also made
to the Government of Côte d'Ivoire to facilitate access to sanitation for a better realization of children's
rights to health and adequate housing conditions.
A Sanitation sectoral policy was made available in June 2015 and a rural sanitation sub-sector
development strategy is currently being finalized. CLTS is considered as one of the strategies for
generating sanitation demand and the end of open defecation as an indicator of improved rural sanitation.
According to latest available national data (MICS, 2016), open defecation is still practiced by 21.8% of
population. In rural areas the OD rate is fifteen times higher (39%) compared to urban settings (2.6%). The
initial report on the implementation of the ACRWC, as well as the evaluations and studies carried out in
Côte d'Ivoire attest to a slow progress and low level of public investment in the field of sanitation in
general and in rural areas in particular. In addition, a series of socio-anthropological studies carried out
on sanitation in Côte d'Ivoire highlight the importance of age-group relationships, gender relations and
socio-economic factors in the implementation of projects aimed at improving hygiene and sanitation
conditions (Brou et al., 2018).
The programme has a monitoring system based on a database of households benefiting from project
interventions established in 2015 by NGO partners as a prelude to its implementation. In addition, a
survey was conducted in 2018 among beneficiary households to measure the results of the program. It
should also be noted that two sustainability checks of the achievements of the Support Program for
Accelerated Access to Water, Hygiene and Sanitation (PADEHA) in other regions of the country, as well as
a review of CLTS were conducted. The results of these studies, reviews and surveys will be provided to the
evaluation team to inform the analysis of the context and results of CLTS implementation in the
programme target areas.
152
b. ASWA (Sierra Leone):
An estimated 46,000 deaths, 60% being children <5 are recorded every year due to illness relating to
access to safe clean water, poor sanitation and hygiene practices in Sierra Leone . In the two districts, the
situation is exaggerated by the high levels of illiteracy, repugnant traditional influences, and rural poverty
and reflective in the low levels of investments in sanitation infrastructures at HH levels, in public facilities,
and the community in general. Open defecation (OD) is still widely practiced, and resultant effect is the
occurrence of both vector and water borne related disease i.e. dysentery, diarrhea, and malaria commonly
recorded in PHU attendance data.
The DGIS programme is critical in addressing above gaps. Its outputs will directly contribute to the
achievements of both country and global WASH key result areas of water, sanitation, hygiene, WASH in
the institutions and WASH in emergencies. The program shall also fulfil the vision of realization of the
human rights to water and sanitation. The proposed project interventions are aligned to Sierra Leone
country office and government 2018/2019 signed rolling work plan. The thrust of the programme is to
contribute to the reduction of services inequality between the urban and rural areas; for example,
national access to improved water sources is 85% and 48% for urban and rural respectively and WASH
gender related issues.
Besides addressing the WASH gap, this programme will also focus on addressing WASH gender issues
related to women, boys and girls within the rural communities. The programme will therefore prioritize
and work towards reducing the negative consequences attributed to lack and /or inadequate provision of
gender sensitive WASH services. Undoubtedly, lack of safe water supply makes women and girls walk long
distances to collect water which in turn takes physical toll on them, especially pregnant women. A lack of
access to suitable sanitation facilities results in women going for long periods without relieving
themselves, damaging their health, and exposing them to the risk of assault as they search for privacy.
Lack of WASH in schools causes girls to miss school days; makes students more vulnerable to harassment;
and hinders children from gaining the knowledge, attitudes and skills they need for good personal hygiene
and health. In addition, lack of adequate water in health care facilities, particularly for hand washing has
been associated with high risk mortality among new-borns where mothers or birth attendants do not
WASH their hand properly. The programme therefore prioritized the identification of gender information
gaps as well as to ensure data is disaggregated. Women, men, girls and boys were also fully involved in
the design, implementation and maintenance of WASH infrastructure and services.
The sustainability of the programme activities is anchored on the Sierra Leone sustainability compact
which is an effort by the government to improve the functionality and use of WASH services in the country,
including the strengthening of private sector and fostering Public-Private partnership and part of UNICEF
efforts to improve sustainability in all its programme. UNICEF is also supporting the government in scaling
up decentralized, participatory monitoring which brings together the devolved government leaders,
153
technical teams, women and children in appraising the implementation processes as well as verification
of the completed work before hand over to the government.
The project will contribute directly towards the achievement of SDGs 4 and 6 by enhancing access to safe
water, safe learning environment through promotion of improved hygiene and sanitation practices. When
achieved, it will contribute towards the government’s post Ebola recovery strategy under health, water
and education pillars.
6. Evaluation Criteria
The evaluation of the sanitation component of the PHAM project will be guided by 5 criteria and that of
the Sierra Leone Program will be guided by 6 (the 5 from Côte d’Ivoire plus 1 additional).
Table 9: Evaluation Criteria

2. Effectiveness 2. Effectiveness
3. Efficiency 3. Efficiency
4. Sustainability 4. Sustainability
5. Gender, Equity and Human Rights (not a 5. Gender, Equity and Human Rights
criterion per se but rather a cross-cutting 6. Impact
dimension)
While the evaluation in Sierra Leone will be guided, among others, by the impact and gender, equity and
human rights criteria, the evaluation in Côte d'Ivoire will not include the impact criterion due to the lack
of data on the long-term effects of the programme. In addition, the evaluation in Côte d'Ivoire will not
include the gender, equity and human rights as a criterion per se but it will consider this to be a cross-
cutting dimension of the data collection and analysis underlying all the other criteria.
7. Evaluation Questions
In order to achieve the goals of the evaluation, the evaluation team should address the following

8. Methodology
The evaluation will be conducted using a participatory and inclusive approach to provide relevant answers
to key evaluation questions. It will be conducted according to UNEG Norms and Standards for Evaluation.
It will integrate human rights, gender and equity in accordance with the relevant UNEG guidelines and will
be conducted in accordance with the UNEG Code of Conduct and Ethical Guidelines for Evaluation.
159
The evaluation will be based on mixed methods of data collection and analysis. Relevant data should be
collected from programme beneficiaries and key implementation stakeholders and partners
(implementing NGOs, Rural Sanitation Directorate, Directorate of public and environmental health,
partners from decentralised technical bodies, the territorial administration, the water, hygiene and
sanitation sector group, UNICEF, etc.).
The Secondary data collection/desk review will include a review of programme reports; surveys and
monitoring reports; reports of similar evaluations, research and studies; and databases. The Desk Review
should include other 8 countries that form part of DGIS funded ASWA Programme (Benin, CAR, Côte
d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mali and Mauritania). The documentation in question, which will be made
available by the Regional Office, would consist of 18 reports: the evaluation team would need to consult
two reports for each one of the 8 countries. The two documents, which will make the object of a
comparison, would be the original program proposal developed by each country in 2013 and the
consolidated report published in 2018 which cover the last five years of implementation. For Sierra leone,
the most recent Sustainability Check will also be made available to the evaluation team.
Primary data collection will involve qualitative and quantitative data collected through key informant
interviews, focus group discussions, community meetings, and observation. The evaluation of the ASWA
programme will also include the administration of a survey. On the other hand, the PHAM evaluation will
include the analysis of the secondary data collected through the beneficiary survey carried out in 2018.
The evaluation team is expected to engage relevant stakeholders including staffs of the Ministry of Water
Resources, District and Local Councils, and the Ministry of Health and Sanitation.
The triangulation of data from the different sources will be performed to guide the elaboration of
evaluation findings. The iterative process of dialogue with the main implementation stakeholders that will
be initiated during the evaluative process will allow to reconstitute the theory of change of the sanitation
component of the PHAM program.
The evaluation team is expected to propose a detailed evaluation methodology that uses mixed methods
and rests on the collection of quantitative and qualitative data designed to provide quality data that
adequately respond to the evaluation purpose and objectives. The evaluation team will develop, design
and compile appropriate research indicators and questions and data collection tools. The evaluation team
will provide detailed sampling strategy/criteria for the selection of sample communities, households and
individuals. Where relevant, the sampling technique should involve representative sampling adequate to
detect changes using appropriate descriptive statistics. The Evaluation Reference Group (ERG) consisting
of UNICEF, Statistics Sierra Leone (the country’s Central Statistics Office), Ministry of Planning and
Economic Development, Ministry of Water Resources and Ministry of Health and Sanitation officials will
review and approve the sampling strategy and if necessary propose modifications or changes. The
evaluation team will describe and finalise the evaluation methodology in an inception report comprising
a detailed work plan with time frame and milestones.
160
The evaluation team must obtain ethical clearance from the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation
and respect the ethics of research while working with diverse population groups. The team must respect
the right of institutions and individuals to provide information in confidence and ensure that sensitive
data are not traced to their source
Building on the Terms of Reference, the desk review and preliminary interviews, the evaluation team will
produce an inception report for each one of the countries which will present the detailed evaluation
methodology. The report will be structured as follows:
▪ Introduction presenting the object of the evaluation, its purpose, scope and objectives;
▪ Preliminary results of the documentary review summarized in the evaluation context section;
▪ Evaluation criteria and questions refined through the desk review and preliminary interviews;
▪ Detailed description of the evaluation methodology, including relevant data collection methods
that will allow answering evaluation questions and sampling strategy;
▪ Evaluation matrix presenting for each evaluation criterion and each evaluation question planned
data collection methods and data sources.
▪ Methods of data analysis;
▪ Limitations of the evaluation and section on ethics and ethical considerations
▪ Work Plan
▪ Annex: List of the main documents reviewed; Proposed data collection tools; Initial list of key
informants.
The evaluation team is expected to produce two reports. The evaluation report shall not exceed 50 pages
(without Annexes) for the PHAM evaluation, and 150 pages (without Annexes) of the ASWA evaluation
and shall include an executive summary of maximum 5 pages. All paragraphs shall be numbered, and
every conclusion and recommendation will need to make explicit reference to the paragraph number
which they are based on. The evaluation team will make sure to follow the UNICEF Evaluation Reports
Standards, as well as the checklist used for the independent assessment of the quality of UNICEF
evaluation reports (meta-evaluation) through GEROS.
The main conclusions and recommendations of the evaluation will be disseminated in the form of "policy
brief" of no more than 5 pages.
The evaluation report validation workshop will serve as an opportunity for the development of the action
plan for the implementation of the main recommendations of the evaluation or "management response".
In addition, a session to share lessons learned from the management and conduct of the evaluation with
the "Emerging Evaluators" and members of the National Monitoring and Evaluation Network (the RISE in
Côte d'Ivoire and SLEMEA in Sierra Leone Overall, this workshop will be organized to contribute to
strengthening national evaluation capacities.
161
9. Practical aspects of the evaluation
9.1 Evaluation team profile
The evaluation will be carried out by a team of evaluation consultants with extensive experience both at
national and international level. In order to ensure that the results of the evaluation are available as soon
as possible (the Côte d’Ivoire Country Office will need preliminary results in August 2019), it is envisaged
that there will be two evaluation teams proposed by the same firm, each one going to one of the countries
(Sierra Leone and Côte d’Ivoire) for more or less the same period. Should the same evaluation team
conduct the evaluation, it is understood that data collection in Cote d’Ivoire will need to take place before
the Sierra Leone country mission.
The team should also have a good knowledge of the country specific context of Sierra Leone and Côte
d’Ivoire as well as of the WASH sector (and in the case of Cote d’Ivoire, of Sanitation more specifically).
The team will work closely together to develop and implement an appropriate methodology and approach
to address the evaluation questions and achieve the expected results of the evaluation. It will undertake
necessary steps to make the evaluation of the sanitation component of the PHAM programme and the
ASWA Program a learning exercise for "emerging evaluators".
9.1.1 Team leader
She/He will coordinate the evaluation team (as already indicated, it may be that the team leader
coordinates two mini-teams) and accompany them in two different times and will ensure the design of
the evaluation, the management of the evaluation process, the quality assurance and the delivery of the
expected products in close collaboration with the other members of the team. She/He shall conduct the
evaluation applying an approach that is conducive to the transfer of competencies to the national
members of the evaluation team. She/He should have the following profile:
▪ Have at least Master’s degree in social sciences (sociology, anthropology, social sciences, statistics
or a related field);
▪ Have proven international expertise in multi-country evaluation and experience as a team leader;
▪ Preferably have also experience from multi-country evaluations;
▪ Have at least 10 years of international experience in evaluating programmes and projects in
general and community-based interventions in particular. Evaluation experience in the field of
WASH (including hygiene and sanitation) and related areas such as health, nutrition,
communication for behavioural change and education would be an asset.
▪ Have a perfect command of quantitative and qualitative methods of research and evaluation
methods based on equity, human rights and gender;
▪ Have excellent oral and written communication skills in French and English as well as skills in
facilitation of participatory processes;
▪ Have work experience in West Africa and Ivory Coast and/or Sierra Leone preferably.
162
9.1.2 Evaluation team members
They will participate in all stages of the evaluation process and will be primarily responsible for collecting
and analysing the data that will be used to establish the evaluative judgment. They will also contribute to
the analysis of the national context and the hygiene and sanitation sector to contextualize the results of
the evaluation. This will involve both secondary data analysis and qualitative interviews with beneficiary
communities and key stakeholders involved in the implementation of the programme. This team of
consultants should consist of at least three experts, including a Water (especially for the Sierra Leone part
of the evaluation), and hygiene and sanitation specialist and an evaluation specialist. The Sierra Leone
part of the evaluation will also require the employment of local enumerators (for the sake of enhancing
the timely submission of deliverables, the proposal will need to indicate whether the same team or two
different teams will be sent to the two countries for the field work). Overall, the evaluation team members
should have the following profile:
▪ Have at least Master’s degree in social sciences;
▪ Have at least 5 years of experience in evaluating development programmes and projects and
WASH interventions in particular;
▪ Have a perfect knowledge of the WASH sector and the country specific context;
▪ Have a perfect command of quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods;
▪ Have experience in the use of participatory appraisal techniques in data collection, sensitive to
gender issues;
▪ Be familiar with the international literature and issues related to WASH and WASH in schools
programming (for ASWA);
▪ Have excellent oral and written communication skills in French (Côte d’Ivoire) and English (Sierra
Leone);
▪ Have excellent analytical, synthesis and writing skills
▪ Must have completed at least two high quality programme evaluations over the past 5 years,
with both related to WASH programming in developing country contexts. (Provision of sample
work is required). Experience of working in West Africa, specifically Côte d’Ivoire and Sierra
Leone is desirable.
▪ The professionals with all the required competencies who also happen to be residents or
citizens of Côte d’Ivoire and Sierra Leone will be given priority during the selection.
All international agencies applying would need to partner with a local organization and develop the
capacity of the local agency to conduct this type of work. Joint teams of national and international
consultants integrating women are strongly encouraged. The applying institution/consortium will be
responsible for all local recruitments and logistical arrangements for field work. UNICEF will not provide
any transportation or logistical support for field travel.
9.2 Evaluation Management
The evaluation will be jointly managed by the Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Section of the UNICEF
Côte d'Ivoire and Sierra Leone Country Offices, which will interact with the evaluation team and provide
technical review and validation of intermediary deliverables as well as of the evaluation report (however,
the contracting will be managed directly the UNICEF Côte d'Ivoire Country Office), Both Country Office
will work in collaboration with the WASH Section and the relevant Ministries in Côte d’Ivoire and, through
the Sierra Leone Office, with stakeholders in Sierra Leone.
163
The Evaluation Reference Group will ensure the quality of the evaluation process, evaluation reports and
policy briefs. It will also ensure the respect of UNEG and UNICEF ethical principles and evaluation
standards. An "Emerging Evaluator" representative will be associated with the work of the Evaluation
Reference Group in each country to gain hands-on experience in managing and conducting evaluations.
The Regional Evaluation Advisor of the UNICEF Office for West and Central Africa and the Regional Adviser
for WASH, as well as their national counterparts of the two countries concerned will contribute to the

99 L’enquête MICS (ou EDS) n’a pas encore lieu et la donnée récente pour l’indicateur « Taux de mortalité des
enfants de moins de 5 ans » n’est pas disponible. Un indicateur de proxy permettant d’apprécier la situation est
présenté à la place ; c’est l’incidence enregistrée de la diarrhée chez les enfants de moins de 5ans. C’est un
indicateur mesuré à partir des données routines et intégré dans le système d’information sanitaire. La dernière
donnée validée est relative à l’année 2016.
100 Latrine améliorée selon le JMP : La latrine à fosse avec dalle est une latrine à fosse sèche entièrement recouverte
par une dalle ou plate-forme montée d’une cuvette. La dalle doit être solide et peut être fabriquée avec tout type de
matériaux (béton, bois avec de la terre ou de la boue, ciment, etc.) tant qu'il couvre intégralement la fosse sans
exposer le contenu de la fosse autrement que par le trou nécessaire à la défécation.

Corrections to data
The following are examples of incorrect data with brief explanations of the corrections applied:
Transcription errors
Koinadugu/ Diang/ Sokurala/ Sokuralatwomankorekor
It was assumed that Sokuralatwo referred to the section so removing this gives:
Koinadugu/ Diang/ Sokurala/ Mankorekor, although this does not match any SSL locality names.
Incorrect chiefdom name
Koinadugu/ Wara Yagala/ Bendugu/ Kurankor Sansa
A locality with the same section name was found in the neighbouring chiefdom so this becomes:
Koinadugu/ Sengbe/ Bendugu/ Kuranko Sansarah, which matches an SSL locality.
Bonthe/ Yawbeko/ Gbonduhun/ Malema
A locality with the same section name was found in the neighbouring chiefdom so this becomes:
Bonthe/ Bum/ Gbondobum/ Malema
Incorrect Section name
Koinadugu/ Wara Yagala/ Yagala/ Kamaseh
Following the splitting of Koinadugu district some of the sections in Koinadugu were renamed:
Koinadugu/ Wara Yagala/ Zone 4/ Kamaseh.
Bonthe/ Sogbeni/ Bayorgboh/ Batogie
A locality with a similar sounding name is found in the neighbouring section so this becomes:
Bonthe/ Sogbeni/ Pengor/ Batoke
Although the progress data base records a new HDW/HP, the HDW/HP at this locality, which is partly
disassembled, was provided not by ASWA but by MoWR/ KOICA and Team and Team contractors in
2018. In view of the errors in location data in the records this should be checked.
Incorrect section and locality name
Bonthe/ Kpanda Kemo/ Haahun/ Haahun/ RC PS – Borehole
369
No section or locality Haahun could be found, the locality name which sounds similar to Haahun is Jahun
(pronounced Yahun). The school at Jahun is recorded in the EMIS data base as a UBC PS. The locality
information then becomes:
Bonthe/ Kpanda Kemo/ Taokunor/ Jahun/ UBC PS – HDW/HP
A visit to this school showed that the water point is not a borehole, but a hand dug well with hand pump,
this water point was being rehabilitated and nearing completion on the day of inspection.
Incorrect chiefdom and section name
Koinadugu/ Nieni/ Nieni/ Alikalia
Alikalia is a large town located in the neighbouring chiefdom of Kalian:
Koinadugu/ Kalian/ Kalian/ Alikalia
Section name missing
Koinadugu/ Kasonko/ / Kafogo
Koinadugu/ Kasonko/ / Thankorosidia
These locality names match SSL localities so the correct sections could be identified:
Kasunko Kakellian/ Kasunko/ Kafogo
In the case of Tankorosedeia it was found to be in a neighbouring chiefdom:
Gbonkobon Kayaka/ Gbonkobor/ Tankorosedeia
The splitting of the old Koinadugu district into Koinadugu and Falaba districts included the creation of
new chiefdoms and sections in both districts and some section boundaries were also adjusted. The
progress data base showed the new districts, but some localities had not been allocated to the correct
district, or the chiefdom and section identities were incorrect due to the above changes.
Other corrections to data
During the field work some additional errors in data were discovered, some examples are as follows:
Bonthe/ Imperri/ Kahekay/ Junctionla/ Fawe PS and Kankalay PS
These schools are not located at Junctionla but at Mogbwemo, so their location becomes:
Bonthe/ Imperri/ Babum/ Mogbwemo/ Fawe PS and Kankalay PS
Bonthe/ Imperri/ Bigo/ Mokaba
370
In the progress data base ASWA has provided a borehole for this locality. This is incorrect as the facility
provided is a hand dug well with hand pump which was completed in December 2020. This locality does
have a borehole, but it was installed in 2018 by MoWR/ KOICA.
Bonthe/ Jong/ Sopan-Cleveland/ Tissana/ DEC PS
This school has a hand dug well which is listed in the progress data base, however, the community report
this well as having been constructed by WVI in 2012 so it is possible that it predates the ASWA project
and instead was rehabilitated by ASWA.

Appendix 7 Facilities Observations Checklist – Technical Narrative
Piped Water Systems
A general observation relevant to all types of piped water systems is that in all cases where these
systems were working the caretakers reported that by far their most common repair task was the
replacement of taps (called pumps in communities). It was noticed that these taps were mostly 15 mm
(half inch) size and very lightly made. If UNICEF could identify a suitable heavy duty tap in 20 mm size
this would make a very large difference to the reliability of all piped water systems in Sierra Leone. These
taps would have a much higher cost, but less frequent replacement would save the cost of the
replacement tap itself as well as the labour cost. A more robust tap might also be suitable for repair,
such as replacement of the tap washer rather than replacement of the whole fitting. UNICEF has clarified
that PVC ball-valves are now used for the taps and these are more durable and less prone to theft.
Gravity Flow Systems
Several gravity flow water systems have been constructed in Koinadugu and Falaba districts by Oxfam
and SLSAV. Gravity flow systems (GFS) can be an attractive technology for rural water supplies due to
their low operating costs and reliability.
The following table lists the GFSs constructed/ rehabilitated under the ASWA program in Koinadugu and
Falaba together with their functional status.

Alikalia (Koinadugu)
This locality had not been included in the sample group but the return journey from Kumala Town to
Kabala passed through the town and this allowed for a brief visit with the Chiefdom Speaker and his
advisors.
These works were the rehabilitation and extension of an existing GFS built by Peace Corps in 1976. This
water system continues to operate but with a reduced capacity and has no storage. Provision of storage
capacity would enable much more effective use of the water available.
Community leaders at Alikalia reported that 5 new storage tanks had been constructed and gravity mains
and distribution pipelines installed as well as 42 new standpipes. However, water had only reached the
first of the 5 storage tanks, and flow to this tank was lower than expected. They said they had expressed
their concern to Oxfam, as the Implementation Partner, that the storage tanks were being constructed
at too high an elevation in relation to the intake and this fear seems to have been justified by the
subsequent results.
Kafogo (Koinadugu)
This GFS uses an intake structure which includes a
small horizontal roughing filter section between
the intake and the storage tank, which is located
close to the intake. The WASH committee
members report that the system is seasonal and
there was no water entering the system on the
day of the visit even though there was a flow in
the stream on which the intake is located. An
inspection showed that this flow was leaking
under the intake structure wall and continuing
down the stream. This flow is just visible to the
lower left of the image of the intake. UNICEF
reported that discussion is ongoing with the IP to
complete the work.
Figure 13-1: Kafogo GFS intake
Kamayimbo (Koinadugu)
As this locality lies along the Kabala to Makeni road a brief visit was made for discussions with WASH
committee members. They reported that the system had stopped working 2 days before as the
distribution pipeline had been cut by an installation team laying a fibre optic cable. The WASH
committee were trying to find a solution to this problem, and it is likely that they will be successful. They
also reported that the water system did not function from January to April and that there had been
previous problems with the intake structure. For example in 2019 the stream flow had escaped from the
intake structure, and they had used sandbags to close this leak, although the same problem has occurred
several times. They report that the source itself is perennial and it may be possible to solve the problems
with the system by improving the intake. UNICEF reported that discussion is ongoing with the IP to
complete the work.
Kumala Town (Koinadugu)
This scheme is a rehabilitation of an existing GFS which was constructed in 1996 but badly damaged
during the war. The original system had no storage tanks, water flowed directly from the intake structure
374
to the taps. It was reported that no survey of the gravity main was carried out for the recent
rehabilitation and that the pipes were laid along the same alignment as the old system. Two storage
tanks had been constructed but no water had reached either tank. During the inspection, a handheld
GNSS device (Trimble TDC 600) was used to capture their positions and elevations, see table.
Point Elevation corrected for
Description Elevation (m above MSL)
No. instrument height
1 1996 intake structure 442.9 441.7
2 New intake structure 421.6 420.4
3 Reservoir 1 397.4 397.4
4 Reservoir 2 (town) 419.0 419.0
5 GL upper part of town 410.2 409.0
These elevations were obtained using the device’s internal GNSS receiver as no external antenna or
receiver was available so there is a range of uncertainty, about +/- 3 m for positions 1 and 2 (which are
in dense tree cover) and between 1 and 1.5 m for points 3, 4, and 5. Despite this the elevation of
reservoir 2 (intended to serve the southern, higher part of the town), is similar to the elevation of the
intake and this would explain why water has not reached this tank. Water has also not reached tank 2
despite its elevation being considerably lower than the intake, flow in both gravity mains may also be
reduced or stopped completely by air trapped at high points in the pipeline, particularly with low heads
and it is understood that in the 1996 system 7 air release vents were provided whereas none have been
provided in the new gravity main. There are also no washouts at low points to allow for the flushing of
debris and sediment from the pipeline.
A further issue with the gravity main was that the pipe was exposed at some areas, and this runs the risk
of damage to the pipeline by unauthorised persons. It was also reported that most part of this
reticulation was not done under ASWA-SL as this was a rehabilitated system.
It was also noticed that the intake was open and contaminated with leaves and tree debris.
The WASH committee members taking part in the inspection said that an intake at a higher level had
been used for the 1996 system but that no water entered this intake during the dry season so for the
new scheme the intake structure was built at a lower elevation.
UNICEF reported that the IP did not complete the work and was not paid. UNICEF has engaged new IP
to make the required design corrections and complete the system.
Mongo Kiridu (Falaba)
This locality was substituted for the locality originally in the sample, Koikoro, as it provided an
opportunity to look at a GFS constructed by an agency other than Oxfam and was also more accessible
in the limited time available for the field work.
The Manager of SLSAV had drawn our attention to the issues with the water system, namely that the
storage tank was at a higher elevation than the intake and this was verified using the hand-held GNSS
device with the following results:
375
Point Elevation (m above Elevation corrected for
Description
No. MSL) instrument height*
1 Intake structure (WL) 482.1 481.7
2 Solar pump feed tank (WL) 455.2 454.7
3 Current collection point (outlet) 477.9 478.1
4 Storage tank (inlet) 499.0 499.0
*All elevation values are subject to uncertainty of up to +/- 1.5 m.
As at Alikalia and Kumala Town there is an issue with the relative elevations of the intake and storage
tank and in this case the elevations obtained using the hand-held GNSS device show clearly that the
storage tank is at a higher elevation than the intake structure.
UNICEF reported that since the intake is almost at the same elevation as the existing community tap
stand, it was not feasible for the water to flow by gravity to a storage tank in the community, which will
be able to, in turn, feed the tap stands. UNICEF decided to introduce a feed tank at a lower elevation
and then pump to a storage tank on a higher ground, which can then feed the tap stands within the
community. UNICEF informed that the facilities has now been completed and fully functioning. A solar
pump was installed to pump the water from the sedimentation tank to the reservoir, which feeds the
tap stands. The old broken pipes have equally been replaced.
Elevations and Survey and Design Process
It is the view of the Evaluation Team that the elevation problems at Kumala Town and Mongo Kiridu
(and possibly at Alikalia as well) show that the methods used for survey and design of these systems
needs to be reviewed. We understand from IP staff that they have been collecting horizontal coordinates
for proposed features such as intakes using mobile devices and providing these locations to UNICEF and
that these coordinates have then been used to obtain elevations using Google Maps or Google Earth,
although this has not been confirmed by UNICEF. If this is the case it is probable that the elevations for
intakes, which are often located in wooded areas, will be artificially high as the technique used for
measuring these elevations using Lidar or space based radar will see the upper level of the tree canopy
as a solid surface.
UNICEF WASH Team has clarified that in their view, there were no elevation problem in Monge Kiridu
and that the design was based on the ground realities. The elevation difference between the intake and
the existing tap stand in the community is just 4 meters (+-2 m). Considering head loss and other
variables, it was not feasible to move the water by gravity to a storage tank in the communities and still
feed the tap stands from the storage tank. UNICEF then decided to introduce a feed tank at a lower
elevation to first receive the water from the intake and then, through a solar pump, lift the water to a
storage tank at a higher elevation to be able to feed the tap stands within the community. This was
simply the intended design based on the peculiarity of the location and was never an elevation error as
report here. For Kumala, UNICEF already confirmed that the IP did not follow the design, could not
complete the work, and was not paid. UNICEF has already engaged another IP to complete the work in
line with the design.
Portable GNSS receivers are now available which can obtain levels of precision (about 0.3-0.5 m
horizontal position and elevation), which are more than adequate for the design of a rural gravity water
system. IP technical staff could be provided with and trained in using this equipment in conjunction with
a handheld device to collect the position data. This device would have a suitable software which would
376
also allow the input of attributes for points or line features. The resultant survey could then be
downloaded to QGIS on an office computer to provide a site plan and other design data. This approach
would have several advantages:
− The training of IP staff in this technique would create a sustainable local capacity and would
incentivise these staff as they would be following a project through from inception to
completion, with responsibility for its success.
− Using the above approach not only the survey but a large part of the design is carried out by
the person in the field. This has a strong practical logic in that siting of structures and
alignment of pipelines are best done while looking at the situation first-hand. Surveying
software has some facilities which facilitate this process, for example, the ability to check
elevation at any time.
− Completed designs would still have to be checked and approved by UNICEF or MoWR technical
staff but as the outputs are in digital form this would be simple to arrange.
UNICEF confirmed that this is already used in the design of piped systems under UNICEF supported
projects.
Intake construction
At Kafogo and Kamayimbo the water systems were not working primarily due to leakage of the intake
structures. This is not likely to be an issue in all GFS, for example the intake structure for the Mongo
Kiridu GFS has been built on a rock outcrop in the stream channel. At Kafogo and Kamayimbo it is likely
that the intakes have been constructed on a foundation which includes porous weathered material, and
a possible solution would be to remove some of this material upstream of the intake weir and seal the
bed and sides of the stream with clay.
General Comments on Gravity Flow Systems
It is the experience of the Evaluation Team that the
springs in Sierra Leone used for gravity feed water
systems are rarely from fractured rock formations but
are usually water table springs in the deep weathered
zone.
As illustrated in Figure 2-1 showing the intake for
Kumala Town, most gravity system intakes in Sierra
Leone are open, and not sealed intakes emerging from
rock fractures and cracks which is the case in areas with
shallow weathering and fractured rock formations. The
reason for raising this issue is that an open intake has
clear implications for water quality, and it is important
Figure 13-2: Kumala Town GFS intake
to consider how the water quality can be ensured or to
consider alternative water sources such as boreholes.
The high, seasonal rainfall in Sierra Leone means that the point at which these springs emerge moves
up or down slope with the rise and fall of the water table. Conventional sealed spring catchments are
thus not feasible and gravity system intakes are usually constructed below the lowest limit of the water
table in the form of weirs with an open impoundment of water behind them. Effectively this water is
377
surface water as it is open to contamination from a variety of sources, see image of intake at Kumala
Town GFS.
One method of protection of this water is to have byelaws in place to prevent human activity in the
catchment area. Such byelaws can be effective and had been in place for the Kumala Town catchment
since 1996. (Byelaws at Kafogo are enforced by fines which are paid to the WASH Committee for water
system repair and maintenance.)
Filters can also be incorporated into the intake structure to remove large material such as leaves, twigs
etc and this has been done in the GFSs built by Oxfam at Kafogo and Kamayimbo. It is also possible to
have slow sand filters, but this loses the main advantage of a GFS which is its simplicity and low operation
and maintenance requirements.
To make the water safe for consumption continuous chlorination can also be provided.
Oxfam had informed us of the non-functionality of the water systems at Alikalia and Kumala Town and
were seeking additional funding to complete these schemes. As explained above, SLSAV were
implementing a solar pumping stage at Mongo Kiridu. We think that before any further work is carried
out there should be a review of the survey and design process to understand the elevation problem and
an alternative approach. In the light of the nature of the sources for gravity flow systems in Sierra Leone
it might also be worthwhile to consider the relative advantages of these systems compared with other
options, such as piped water systems based on solar pumped boreholes which is a technology already
widespread in Sierra Leone. Although pumping and an energy source are required, water quality is much
better even without any form of treatment. In favour of gravity flow systems the technology is very
simple, and most problems can be fixed by a competent builder and a plumber. It should also be said
that often communities have a history of using a particular source, for example they may have depended
on it during very dry periods, and this can influence their preference for a gravity scheme based on this
source.
Solar BH Piped Water Supplies
In this type of water system a borehole is provided which is fitted with a solar powered submersible
pump. Storage capacity is usually provided by plastic tanks on a concrete stand which pressurises the
distribution system and also provides an elevated mounting for the solar array, clear of buildings and
most trees and also relatively secure from theft.
This type of water supply is common throughout Sierra Leone, particularly for health facilities and
schools. For health facilities they provide a self-contained source of pressurised water which can supply
the internal plumbing of the clinic.
CEDA implemented 10 of these systems under the ASWA project in Bonthe district, and during fieldwork
we discovered other similar systems which had been implemented by WVI, also under ASWA, although
the number of these systems is unknown as UNICEF has not provided any information on them. The
sample for Bonthe included one of these WVI systems, (Tihun, St. Josephs PS) and the water system at
Fawe primary school in Imperri chiefdom, which had been reported in the UNICEF progress report as a
borehole with hand pump, was also found to be a solar BH piped water system implemented by WVI.
We also discovered WVI community systems at Tihun and Junctionla but time pressure did not allow
378
observation checklists to be carried out, in these cases a note was taken of functional status and images
were collected.
Two other CEDA systems were added to increase the sample size , Senehun, which was very close to
Mattru across the river, and Gbangbama, which lies along the road from Mattru to Mogbwemo.

Comments on partially functioning and non-functional systems
Tihun (CEDA) – Parts of the distribution system are out of action, (5 out of 15 taps working), water is not
used for drinking and the amount of water provided does not meet demand, with regular queuing at
taps.
Gbangbama (CEDA) – Parts of the distribution system do not function correctly, (3 taps out of 9 working).
Water used for drinking only by some users, water supplied does not meet demand, with regular
queuing at taps.
Tihun (WVI) – This system was reported to have broken down in 2017, about one year after construction.
The problem is believed to be a failure of the submersible pump, so probably beyond the capacity of the
town WASH committee to replace.
379
In terms of number of systems 6/7 solar BH PWS were found to be either functional or partially
functional, 4/7 were functional.
Water Quality
The CEDA water system at Tihun is not used as a source of
drinking water. Users report that the water is clear when
collected but then develops a brownish colouration, and that
there is also some sediment. The water is used for all other
purposes but drinking water is collected from the solar BH PWS
at St Josephs Primary School or from the CHC, which also has a
solar BH PWS.
The reports of the water quality from the Gbangbama solar BH
PWS are very similar, with some but not all consumers using
the water for drinking and also reporting a slight brownish
colour with sediments.
The change in colour from clear to brownish after drawing the
water suggests high iron levels In addition to iron, the sediment
could be due to insufficient development of the borehole after
completion or poor borehole construction. This indicates that
Figure 13-3: Water from Gbangbama WS
implementation procedures could be improved e.g. water
quality testing after borehole completion but before construction of the water supply.
In the case of the solar BH PWS at St Joseph’s RC PS at Tihun, the water quality was reported as very
good, and this borehole is located a 220 m from the community system borehole. Tihun lies in the
Bullom series which is characterised by laterally continuous unconsolidated aquifers so the presence of
high levels of iron in one of these boreholes and not the other is surprising. This also supports the view
that the presence of sediment is more likely to be a result of the well design and construction than of
the aquifer.
No records have been provided for any of the water supplies so the water quality characteristics cannot
be checked from borehole records but should be investigated to determine the cause. If the water
produced is not being used for drinking this is an inefficient use of UNICEF resources.
All the other sampled solar BH PWS were reported by users as having good water quality.
System Capacity
The standard solar BH PWS seem to be available with 3 storage capacities, 5 m3 for schools and small
communities and 10 m3 and 20 m3 for larger communities.
The following table makes estimations of the demand for all the solar BH PWS surveyed or visited during
the fieldwork in Bonthe district. In the case of Tihun there are 3 separate solar BH PWS, constructed by
CEDA, WVI and a third non ASWA IP. The share of the total daily demand has been attributed to these
water systems in the proportion 70%, 20% and 10% respectively.
A storage capacity of 62% of the daily demand provides adequate capacity to smooth out the
fluctuations in demand and supply as well as provide some reserve for 2 days of reduced solar energy.
380
This has been used to estimate the required storage capacity in each case and compare with the storage
provided.
For a solar powered water system 1 l/sec . of borehole yield pumped for 7 hours provides about 25
m3/day so these system capacities seem well matched to the capacity of a borehole which in the Bullom
Series can be up to 2 l/sec.

This table shows the good match between the 5m3 tank size system and schools, and this is the size of
system preferred by MoHS for clinics.
However for community water systems it is clear that more attention should be paid to matching the
system capacity and storage with the size of the community and other design parameters.
381
Distribution Systems
The CEDA constructed systems at both Tihun and Gbangbama
had poorly performing distribution networks. At Tihun there
were several areas where the pipelines had been laid very close
to the surface with consequent damage to the PE pipes. In
general the capacity of the pipelines seemed to be too low, and
some had become blocked so that only 5 of the 15 standpipes
were functioning. In some places consumers, in frustration, had
unearthed the pipes and cut them so that they could fill
containers and queuing was common. My driver witnessed a
dispute between the wife of an elder and the wife of the town
chief over precisely this issue.
Figure 13-5: Tihun CEDA solar BH PWS-signs of water shortage Figure 13-4: Tihun CEDA solar BH PWS,
distribution pipeline on the surface.
At Gbangbama the WASH Committee members reported that 20 mm pipes were used throughout the
distribution system even though larger diameter pipes had been brought to site. There were frequent
pipe blockages and only 3 of a total of 9 standpipes were reliably functional, with a fourth functional
only when other taps were closed. It is notable that no piped connection was made during construction
to the CHC close to the town centre, so the community funded and arranged for this connection to be
made themselves, unfortunately the connection was not working on the day of the visit due to problems
with the distribution system in general.
To address these problems with distribution systems the system designs should be reviewed and
compared with what has been implemented. The effectiveness of supervision also needs to improve.
There were no distribution problems reported by users at the other systems.
It should be noted that these facilities were only rehabilitated by ASWA-SL and most of the pipe
network were not done under ASWA.
Construction quality
The brief inspections carried out showed fair to good construction quality with a few exceptions:
382
The poor installation of pipelines, i.e.. insufficient depth, which has been mentioned above. The
evaluation team recognise that some of these systems are rehabilitated as part of ASWA-SL, and
therefore the insufficient construction quality can stem from the original construction. However, when
the population in a service area is reported to be served by ASWA-SL, then it should be expected that
the rehabilitated project is designed to bring the water system to the expected quality to ensure
continued operation.
At Gbangbama the first water tower was condemned as not being strong enough to support the 2 No. 5
m3 tanks and was instead used as a support for the solar array. A second tank support was constructed
alongside the first by a new contractor (Code Salone) and the tanks have been installed on this tower.
This suggests that supervision could be improved since early inspection identifying the faulty
construction would prevent the waste of time and resources used to construct the two towers instead
of only one.
Hand Dug Wells with Hand Pumps (HDW/ HP)
New facilities
The new HDW/ HPs inspected were generally of good quality but with the following problems being
identified in more than one case:
Insanitary hatch covers.
Ideally the hinged hatch should close over and outside the raised steel frame to prevent contaminated
water on the cover from entering the well (see Image below of Gerehun DEC PS well).
As a further precaution the concrete around the hatch should also be cast to form a raised lip into which
the frame is cast, (see image below of Pelewahun community well, this lip is too low, and the hatch is
insanitary). It is also important that the hatch frame is not recessed into the well cover due to the
application of a thick layer of topping as this negates the advantage of having a raised frame, (see image
of Jahun community well below).
Having a raised lip cast into the well cover provides an additional barrier to the entry of contaminated
spilt water back into the well. No drawings of the well cover were provided but if the MWR standard
design is being used this part of the well cover is not well detailed . It is recommended that more detailed
drawings of this area be provided to contractors and supervisors be made aware of its importance for
the safety of the water supply.
383
Figure 1: Gerehun DEC PS well Figure 2: Pelewahun community well Figure 3: Jahun Community well
Security Gate mounting
The hinges of some of these gates had broken loose from their anchorage in the concrete wall around
the well and at Mokosie community the hinges on the gate had broken.
Rehabilitated facilities
Rehabilitation of existing wells seems an attractive a cost effective option, but it is important to
understand if the well is seasonal, what the reasons for this are. If digging of the original well did not
reach rock and was carried out while the water table was high then there is a good chance of success.
However, at some of the well rehabilitations visited, e.g. Koromasilaya community well, the excavation
of the original well was stopped due to the diggers reaching rock and so there was little chance of a
rehabilitation being successful. The suggestion is that due to the very poor record keeping in Sierra
Leone, the community are carefully consulted before any decision is made about rehabilitation.
School Latrines
Guttering (also applies to community RWH systems)
A problem in almost all school latrine rainwater harvesting installations was the quality of installation of
the guttering, and the following issues were observed:
Guttering incorrectly mounted in relation to the roof covering so that rainwater would run past the
gutter.
No stop ends in guttering allowing water to flow to waste. Running outlets used at the ends of gutters
instead of end outlets allowing water to run to waste.
Outlets and down pipes poorly supported so that in most of the latrines inspected these parts had fallen
off. When a running outlet is used at the end of a gutter it is difficult to support so a better detail would
be to install running outlets close to but not at the end so they would be supported by guttering fixed
by fascia clips at each side. The down pipe would then have to be fitted around the corner of the building
but clipping it to the walls would provide a much more secure installation.
384
Figure 13-6: Herikofeh community RWH, poorly supported end outlet. Figure 13-7: Jahun UBC PS, poorly
supported end outlet and down pipe
Figure 13-6: Bumbukoro MCA PS, full length guttering, most gutters were too short.
Most gutters were much too short, for example the guttering fitted to the very large roof of Bumbukoro
MCA PS was only about 4 m long so most of the rainwater falling on this very large roof was wasted. Not
surprisingly the caretaker reported that even after heavy rain storms the 10,000 litre tank only filled to
about a third of its capacity.
385
Disabled access
Ramps
Where disabled access had been considered there was always a ramp
to facilitate access to the facility. It was noticed however that erosion
at the toe of the ramp in some cases had created a step which would
be difficult for wheelchair users to negotiate. This could be avoided if
the ramp was extended below ground level during construction and it
is suggested that this detail be included in the drawings for these
facilities.
Figure 13-7: Ramp at Mokosie DEC PS
Grab Rails
Grab rails were provided in all special needs cubicles, and these were more
or less as indicated in the MEST drawings. At Mokaba DEC PS in Mokaba a
different approach had been used with grab rails on both sides and a seat
so the user would not have to squat or suspend themselves while using the
facility. The provision of grab rails on both sides seems to provide a more
balance support than a single rail. Also just visible next to the toilet is a
tiled washing area which seems a worthwhile addition.
Figure 13-8: Special needs
cubicle at Mokaba DEC PS
Rainwater Harvesting (RWH)
Guttering
The same comments as made for school latrine gutters also apply to community RWH systems.
Is Rainwater Harvesting Appropriate
Rainwater harvesting can only supply water on a seasonal basis and should therefore be considered as
a water source supplementary to a community’s principal, perennial water source. Harvesting and
storing sufficient water to last for the whole year is simply not viable and is not necessary as there is a
huge store of rainwater in the ground which can be exploited using wells and boreholes. It is therefore
a bit surprising to find that at Herikofeh, a community reliant on surface sources who say they had
wanted a well, that a RWH system was provided. It is understood that this was a pilot project, but there
was no need for this, and it has prolonged the suffering of this community unnecessarily. Due to the lack
of data available it is not possible to comment about any of the other communities provided with RWH,
but it should be a priority for UNICEF to investigate and provide perennial water sources where they are
required as soon as possible.
386
Claims for Population Served
There are a number of comments which can be made about the way the progress report is prepared.
In all the communities listed in the progress report, the whole population of the community seems to
have been used to assess the numbers of persons benefitting from the ASWA program. This is incorrect
as a single water point will not provide an adequate supply of water to a community greater than the
total number the systems are designed to cover.
The MWR recommended number of persons to be served by a point water source such as a HDW/ HP
or BH/ HP is 250. At the basic service level of 20 lpcd this requires the water point to produce about 5
m3/day which is a about the most that can be expected of a typical well, so greater populations will be
unlikely to receive adequate water. A borehole may produce more water but when the number of users
exceeds 250 the wear and tear on the pump is greater and the cost of repairs is greater. For these
reasons, a single point source cannot be considered to have adequately served the entire population of
a locality if this is greater than 250 persons.
The gravity schemes in Falaba and Koinadugu have been presented in the reporting available to the
Evaluation Team as completed whereas none of the 5 schemes visited was functional (Mongo Kiridu was
partly functional) at the time of the field work, which was one year after the formal end of the project.
Some of these schemes are not new schemes but rehabilitations of older schemes, e.g. Kumala Town,
Alikalia, Kafogo, and has been indicated in the report.
Some point sources reported as complete in the ASWA-SL progress till end of 2019 were incomplete at
the time of the evaluation team’s field visits in December 2020 or had recently been completed or were
still under construction. The water points at Mokaba and Jahun communities had been completed a few
days before our visit and the well at Jahun UBC PS was still under construction. There are also some
water points included in the progress report which have never worked (Gbahama), or which are seasonal
and so cannot be considered to have provided a basic service, (Koromasilaya community and Ahmadiyya
PS, Tissana DEC PS, and several others).
At Batoke community in Sogbeini chiefdom no ASWA water point was found, but as no coordinates for
the locations of facilities were provided to the Evaluation Team, there is some uncertainty about this
observation.

8.2. Amount willing to pay for water services (2020 end line)
Although over 90% of water users say they make no contribution to the service they receive, when
asked how much they would be willing to pay the situation is different. The proportion of water users
who said they would be willing to pay in 2016 was greater than 90% but this decreased very markedly
in 2020 to 33% for Bonthe and 59% for Falaba and Koinadugu.
The amount which households would be willing to pay monthly (excluding those unwilling or unable
to pay) was between 3,100 and 4,166 Leones, except for the 2020 survey in Falaba and Koinadugu
where the amount was 11,213 Leones. This higher amount is due to a few households for which the

10. Types of WS improvements wanted
In both the 2016 and 2020 surveys the water supply improvement given the highest priority in Bonthe
was improved water quality while in Falaba and Koinadugu the preferred improvement indicated in
the 2016 survey was water source protection, but this had changed to water system reliability in 2020.
The priority given to source reliability also increased in Bonthe, from third to second place.

15. Changes in SDG water supply service level with season
There has been a marked general increase in the SDG water supply service levels in the wet season
between 2016 and 2020. In Bonthe the proportion of households having a safely managed or basic
service has increased from 20.0% to 51.5%. In Falaba and Koinadugu this proportion has increased
from 42.9% to 63.9%. The fall in the SDG service level during the dry season is still clear but in the 2016
survey these users mainly resorted to surface sources (no service), whereas in 2020 the increase as
mainly in the use of unimproved sources, which are safer than surface sources.
