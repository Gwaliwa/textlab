GLOSSARY
Term Definition
Birth Registration Birth registration is the permanent and universal recording of a child’s birth by the government and serves as
legal proof of his/her existence and identification. Not only is BR a fundamental human right, but it also provides
the foundation for safeguarding civil, political, social, economic and cultural rights.1
Certification The issuance by the civil registrar of a legal document certifying a birth or death.2
Civil Registration Civil registration is defined as the continuous, permanent, compulsory, universal recording of the
and Vital Statistics occurrence and characteristics of vital events pertaining to the population, as provided through decree or
(CRVS) regulation in accordance with the legal requirements in each country, with full respect for the rules regulating
the protection and privacy of individual information.3
Coherence The compatibility of the intervention with other interventions in a country, sector or institution.4
Contribution Contribution Analysis is an approach for assessing causal questions and inferring causality in real-life
Analysis programme evaluations. It offers a step-by-step approach designed to help managers, researchers and
policymakers arrive at conclusions about the contribution their programme has made (or is currently making)
to outcomes.5
Date of Registration The day, month and year when an entry of registration of a vital event is made in civil register.6
Delayed The registration of a vital event after the prescribed period specified in existing laws, rules or regulations
Registration (including any specified grace period). Delayed registration is usually considered to be the registration of a vital
event one year or more after the event has occurred. (Not to be confused with ‘late registration’).7
Effectiveness The extent to which the intervention achieved, or is expected to achieve, its objectives and results, including
any differential results across groups.8
Efficiency The extent to which the intervention delivers, or is likely to deliver, results in an economic and timely way.9
Impact The extent to which the intervention has generated or is expected to generate significant positive or negative,
intended or unintended, higher-level effects.10
Lady Health LHWs provide primary health care services to underserved populations in rural and urban areas. These workers
Workers (LHW) are attached to a local health facility, but they are primarily community based, working from their homes.
Late Registration Registration of a vital event after the prescribed time-period but within a specified grace period. Since the grace
period is usually considered to be one year following the vital event, late registration means the registration of
a vital event within one year of the event occurring (not to be confused with delayed registration).11
Lot Quality Provides real-time planning and management information. It uses small sample sizes to classify administrative
Assurance geographical areas, to inform if these areas have achieved or not a pre-determined target for a given indicator.12
Sampling (LQAS)
Mixed Methods A mixed-method evaluation systematically integrates two or more evaluation methods, potentially at every
stage of the evaluation process, usually drawing on both quantitative and qualitative data.13
Nikkah Registrars Marriage Registrars who have the legal authority to perform marriage ceremonies.
Participatory An approach that involves the stakeholders of a programme or policy in the evaluation process. This
Evaluation involvement can occur at any stage of the evaluation process, from the evaluation design to the data collection
and analysis and the reporting of the study.14
Primary Caregivers Primary caregivers of children are those adults who, if the parents of the child are deceased or do not live in
the same household with the child, take the primary responsibility of raising the child. A person can be identified
as the primary caregiver of a child only if he/she lives in the same household with the child. They are not
persons who take care of the child when the parents are away.
Quasi Experimental Quasi-experimental research designs, like experimental designs, test causal hypotheses. These designs
identify a comparison group that is as similar as possible to the treatment group in terms of baseline (pre-
intervention) characteristics. The comparison group captures what would have been the outcomes if the

Executive Summary
This is the final report for the Summative Evaluation of the Digital Birth Registration Programme
(henceforth referred to as DBR or the Programme), supported by the United Nations Children’s Fund
(UNICEF) Pakistan Country Office (PCO) and Telenor Pakistan (a mobile service operator). DBR sought to
expedite birth registration (BR) of children as a means of contributing to universal birth registration (UBR) for
children under 17 years old (with a focus on children under five (U5)). AAN Associates was contracted to
implement the evaluation, undertaken from December 2021 to September 2022.
Chapter 1 - Intervention Context and Object of Evaluation: In Pakistan, BR was reportedly 42.2 per cent
(2017-2018), implying that one in every two children was not registered and not counted in development
planning and resource allocation decisions. Provincial BR rates varied – 58 per cent for Punjab and 28 per
cent in Sindh.19 Contributory factors for low BR coverage include: limited government capacity; complex BR
process; high direct and indirect costs for service users; and limited community awareness on the process
and importance of BR.
The intervention evaluated is the UNICEF PCO-supported DBR Programme which intended to reform the
BR system to improve BR rates in selected districts of two provinces. The Programme was implemented in
two phases. In Phase I (2017-2018) five districts (Bahawalpur, Pakpattan, Thatta, Badin and Naushahro
Feroze) were selected. In Phase II (2019-2021), the intervention was expanded to four additional districts,
including Lahore, Multan, Dera Ghazi (D.G.) Khan and Karachi.
Chapter 2 - Evaluation Purpose, Objectives and Scope: This is a Summative Evaluation intended to
demonstrate commitment to accountability. The evaluation scope included all DBR-funded activities
implemented in nine districts from 2017 to 2021 (excluding the pilot phase). The evaluation followed the
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development - Development Assistance Committee’s (OECD-
DAC) prescribed criteria (i.e., relevance, coherence, efficiency, effectiveness, impact and sustainability). The
evaluation also focused on UNICEF programming priorities including gender equality, equity, human rights-
based approach (HRBA) and disaster risk resilience (DRR).
Chapter 3 - Evaluation Design, Methodology and Limitations: The evaluation is guided by two
overarching designs: Theory-based and Participatory. The evaluation team conducted a Hybrid
Evaluation, comprising two sub-designs (i.e., Contribution Analysis and Quasi Experimental). The
contribution analysis sub-design was applied to measure DBR’s outcome achievements, and quasi-
experimental was used to establish if the demand-side interventions worked to increase uptake of BR
services. The evaluation used a Mixed-Methods approach including: key informant interviews (KIIs), focus
group discussions (FGDs) and household surveys (HHS). In total, 1189 people participated in and informed
the evaluation including 864 HHS respondents (431 male and 433 female), 37 KII respondents (27 male and
10 female) and 288 FGD participants (220 male and 68 female). The evaluation team conducted a desk
review of 174 documents, used to complement primary data. Limitations include: unavailability of baseline
data on BR awareness for possible before-after comparison (for which control-treatment comparison was
made using single point data); inconsistency of results framework with result-based management principles
for impact assessment; and limited information on budgeting for comprehensive efficiency assessment.
Chapter 4 - Evaluation Findings and Conclusions: Key findings and conclusions are outlined below:
Relevance: The evaluation findings indicate that DBR was relevant on multiple levels. These are evident in
terms of alignment of DBR goals, objectives and strategies with those of national and provincial policies/plans
(i.e., National Framework on Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) Reforms (2020), Punjab Birth
Registration Strategy 2016 and Birth Registration Strategy Sindh 2018-2022). DBR strategies/interventions
seem appropriate for addressing both the demand and supply-side barriers to BR such as: i) capacity
development of local government (LG) and facilitators on digital technology; ii) partnerships with health,
education and social welfare to expand outreach of BR services; and iii) community awareness and education
for uptake of BR services. There are noted design deficiencies: two-step process (separation of registration
and certification), instead of a single step (registration and certification happening in the same visit); fee
charge for certification (including penalties for delayed and late registration); and double-entry registration
system (as the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) and DBR systems are not synced).
Coherence: Evaluation findings indicate that DBR is largely coherent in terms of assisting provinces to
expedite UBR and develop digital BR models in line with priorities identified in provincial BR policy
documents. DBR is found to be partly consistent with UNICEF Global Guidelines (2013). It is consistent in
terms of: BR system being continuous, universal, timely and established under the civil registry/national ID
administration and BR system being. There are inconsistencies such as: BR is not free (users are charged
for late/delayed registration); certificate is not free; limited institutionalization or policy framework for
interoperability; and system does not monitor the demand creation activities (such as lack of baseline on
community awareness or practices).

SUMMATIVE EVALUATION OF DIGITAL BIRTH REGISTRATION PROGRAMME 2017-2021
i
Efficiency: The Programme efficiency measurement was constrained for limited thematic disaggregation of
the budget. From the data available, the Programme managed to achieve 137 per cent of intended BR targets
by spending 98 per cent of funds. In relative terms, Phase I proved less efficient compared to Phase II, for
achieving only 73 per cent of the planned registration target. Phase II exceeded the registration targets by
achieving 174 per cent of registration numbers. The cost/beneficiary comes to USD20$0.53 per registration
(minus certification) and USD$3.33 per certification. The certification cost falls in the middle when compared
with other countries i.e., Nigeria (USD$0.27), Liberia (USD$1.38), Tanzania (USD$2.03), Ethiopia (USD$4)
and South Sudan (USD$6).
Effectiveness: Programme effectiveness is assessed at two levels (i.e., achievement of outcomes (output
achievements are used, as outcomes did not have indicators) and relative effectiveness of programme
strategies). DBR was mostly effective for achieving most of the outcomes (in Phase I two out of five
outcomes21 were mostly achieved and in Phase 2, two out of three outcomes22 were fully achieved). As for
the registration targets, the findings indicate that DBR registered 2.6 million children in nine districts against
the target of 1.9 million (0.5 and 2.1 million in Phase I and Phase II respectively). Factors that contributed to
the achievement of targets include: demonstrated leadership and ownership by relevant public entities (LG
in both provinces); engagement of community-based facilitators expanded outreach of BR services; inclusion
of community influencers helped in dissemination of awareness messages; partnership with Telenor enabled
access to technical and financial resources; and adaptive programming whereby learnings contributed to
improving design and delivery. Disabling factors that hindered achievements included: technological
challenges (limited internet connectivity and digital infrastructure, power shortages); lack of interoperability
between NADRA and the local government registration systems; use of two step approach (registration and
certification); delayed payments to facilitators that demotivated them; and disruptions due to COVID-19.
DBR strategies demonstrate varied levels of effectiveness (strategies are assessed by looking at their
contributions to achievement of intended results and relevant stakeholders’ views on their efficacy). Effective
strategies include: advocacy and technical support for policy reforms (enabled developing Birth and Death
Registration Rules in Punjab and bye-laws in Sindh), technology integration in the BR process (DBR
application was developed which reduced cost and time for the service users); community education and
sensitization (helped to increase community awareness on process, documentation and importance of BR).
Others that remained less effective include: capacity/staff development of stakeholders (a capacity
assessment was not conducted with noted variations in capacities of different types of facilitators deployed
and trained) and partnerships (engagement has not been institutionalized whereby BR would be included in
duties of relevant staff in other departments).
Impact: The impact measurement remains incomplete due to absence of an impact statement and indicators
(in both the Results Framework and Theory of Change (ToC)). The evaluation team has used the long-term
objective (as proxy) in terms of accelerated BR coverage in both provinces. While the latest secondary data
is unavailable to determine the magnitude of change, primary data (HHS) indicates that the BR rate23 in
treatment districts is higher (42 per cent) compared to control districts (7 per cent). Qualitative discussions
with community members are indicative of perceived changes such as children’s improved access to social
services (education, health, social protection) and reduced vulnerability to protection risks such as child
marriage, child labour and trafficking (but could not be verified for absence of secondary data). DBR has
resulted in unintended results such as focus on other vital events (such as marriage, divorce and death) and
technology-trained facilitators that can contribute to other exercises (immunization, census, elections).
Sustainability: DBR was implemented without a sustainability or exit strategy. The evaluation team has
assessed the sustainability of programme strategies and results and rated them accordingly. The gains made
to bring legal and administrative reforms are likely to be sustainable (amended bye-laws in Sindh and
approved Birth and Death Registration Rules in Punjab). The digitization of the BR system is likely to be
sustainable as provinces have either adopted or are keen to use the application for scale-up. Punjab has
allocated PKR2440 million and plans to scale up to 36 districts using the DBR application (renamed Baldia
Online). The Local Government Department (LGD) Sindh intends to scale up the digital service across 30
districts with PKR21 million allocated. The capacity building component is rated partially sustainable for
continuous need to retrain human resources on upgraded systems. On partnerships, DBR partnered with
relevant government departments (health, education, social welfare) through notifications, however, this is
less likely to be sustainable unless partnerships are institutionalized with changes in job descriptions of
relevant staff. Community awareness has improved; however, it may fade with time. Hence, the departments
need to plan and implement awareness on a recurring basis.

Non-DAC
Gender Equality: DBR is assessed as partially compliant with gender equality principles. At the design
stage, a gender assessment was not conducted nor any gender-disaggregated targets set. In terms of
implementation, some interventions promoted gender equality such as: door-to-door registration for mothers;
involvement of LHWs to gain trust and access to mothers; community education prioritised both mothers and
fathers. In terms of results of registration numbers, there is slight gender disparity between boys (54 per cent)
and girls (46 per cent).25 Although, the population sex ratio (male/female) is 103.41 for Punjab and 108.29
for Sindh.26 However, BR was slightly lower in girls compared to boys (prior to the initiation of DBR)27 in both
provinces and therefore should have been prioritised. Reporting on gender and age disaggregates for other
results was weak/non-existent.
Equity: DBR is assessed as partially compliant to equity principles. Design was not informed by an equity
assessment and some of the most vulnerable districts (in terms of BR rates) were not prioritized in both
provinces. In terms of implementation, some interventions were equity-centred including door-to-door service
for hard-to-reach areas and communication outreach through various platforms to reach vulnerable
communities Even though the Programme did not report on equity components, the HHS findings show that
poor households and disabled children were registered through the Programme.
HRBA and DRR: DBR is consistent with the HRBA principles of participation (in terms of developing relevant
partnerships); non-discrimination and equality (for providing access to DBR services without discrimination);
legality (for ensuring consistency with local laws and child rights provisions); and empowerment (2.6 million
children were registered and now have a legal identity). It is partially consistent with the principle of
accountability due to lack of a feedback/complaint system for recipients. There is no evidence of DRR
integration in DBR strategy, execution or results.
Chapter 5 - Conclusions, Lessons Learnt and Recommendations
Conclusions on the Way Forward: Future assistance must be guided by an expressed impact and
sustainability plan, which was not the case for the period evaluated. The provinces need to be guided to think
of a system for birth registration which is focused on newborns and for that the role of health departments is
central. The provincial lead departments must evolve a system whereby healthcare infrastructure is engaged
and provided the tools to do BR at birth and immediately afterwards. The same system could focus on
children between 1-4 years, for the fact that these children are more likely to interface with the system. For
age four and above, the focus must shift to periodic campaign work preferably through education sector (for
both in-school and out-of-school children) to help address the service gap for unregistered children. Whatever
solution is evolved, the system should require parents/caregivers to interface once (not more), and later the
LG and NADRA systems should interface on their own without asking parents to pay repeated visits.
Lessons Learnt: Key lessons and good practices are outlined below:
1. The shift from centralised to decentralised services is central to uptake of public services such
as birth registration. DBR has proven this as the process of BR was decentralised and the engagement
of facilitators (both from the public sector and others) helped expand outreach and made services more
accessible to users (in contrast to certification which was kept centralised). For instance, in the selected
districts, the number of BR points increased from 800 to 11,000 (almost 14 times), which supported
registration of over 2.6 million children in five years. Aided further by digital registration, this approach
helped to take services closer to end users. It also saved time and cost (indirect) for parents and
caregivers (at least for registration).
2. Shift to innovative use of digital technology is both inevitable and revolutionary, as it can aid in
taking services to the users and cutting time and costs. DBR has demonstrated this by use of digital
tools which have facilitated taking services to end users (at least registration). The uptick in registration
numbers has proven that if people are offered a viable option, they are willing to register children. This
is equally useful for the service providers to enable real-time data tracking and validation.
Recommendations: Find below evaluation recommendations drawn from findings and conclusions:
Recommendation 1: BR system reforms must continue to enable provinces to make BR services
simplified, accessible and affordable. The intervention has demonstrated that the solution lies in
decentralisation, digitization and demand creation of services. The intervention has done the much-
needed foundational work and has generated visible appetite (amongst provinces) to continue. There
are still design and operational aspects that merit improvements to help provinces continue and
upscale. The recommended actions for continuity and upscaling include:
• The BR Rules (in Punjab) and Bye-laws (in Sindh) may need to be reviewed and revised to include a one
visit-one step approach (whereby both registration and certification are done simultaneously requiring
one interaction with parents/caregivers); free of cost registration and certification (the first copy of the
certificate may be issued free of cost in the allowed period with rationalised penalties for late/delayed
25 BR weekly statistics reports
26 Taken from Census 2017 results.
27 As per MICS Punjab 2017-2018, 75.8% boys are registered compared to 74.8% girls and as per MICS Sindh 2018-2019 34.4% boys are registered compared to 33.6% girls).

registration); and formalize interoperability by stating the support roles of different public entities for BR
such as departments of health, education, social welfare and others.
• System reforms must prioritise creating a system for registration at birth or immediately after birth. The
role of health departments remains central to making such a system work. The Local Government and
Community Development Department (LG&CDD) (in Punjab) and LGD (in Sindh) must formalize
interoperability by introducing requisite changes in Rules of Business (or mandate of health and other
relevant departments) and updating frontline staff to contribute as per the prescribed support role.
• Future reforms must underline the issue of non-registered children as a priority by evolving campaign-
based approaches or modalities. This may be done better if the unregistered children are disaggregated
into two groups (i.e., ages 1-5 and ages 5-17), and then interventions can be undertaken with the health
system to register children ages 1-5 (as this group is more likely to interface with health system for
immunization and healthcare) and schools for tapping onto the unregistered children in schools including
out-of-school children (by launching campaigns during summer and session breaks).
• The BR system should issue a LG&CDD and LGD-based unique ID to every child (and this may not
necessarily be same as the ID given by NADRA) and together with parents’ details (including
Computerised National Identity Card (CNIC)) feed into the LG&CDD and LGD databases. LG and NADRA
databases should interface using the parents’ IDs to update Form B and other data, without parents
needing to interface with the system again. The current system does not allow simultaneous registration
and certification as there needs to be verification from the NADRA system and issuance of a NADRA-
given Civil Registration Management System (CRMS) ID.
• The BR database should be functionally linked to other vital events (marriage, divorce, death) and the
database should be accessible to other public sector planners (with restricted access to
private/confidential information) for planning and resource allocation decisions.
• Explore partnerships with the private sector and other mobile network companies for technical and
financial support and to address issues around internet connectivity and data backlog, especially in hard-
to-reach areas. Seek help from development partners to document (in the form of visibility materials) the
Telenor Case Study and organize events to seek support from the private sector.
• Seek technical assistance and plan capacity assessment of facilitators and Union Council (UC) staff in
target districts. With varied capacities of registration staff, this may require updating the training materials
along with the length of training/refresher events. While LG&CDD have embedded BR as part of routine
training exercises for LG staff, this initiative should be replicated in Sindh as well.
• Plan and implement periodic communication campaigns and integrate it with other campaigns (such as
school enrolment campaigns, breastfeeding weeks, mother and child health weeks) to enable continuous
messaging around the importance and processes of birth registration.
• Seek technical assistance and commission gender equality and equity assessments (at provincial levels)
and use findings to inform the design, implementation and reporting of gender equality and equity
parameters such as updating monitoring tools to collect gender and equity-specific data and updating
communication messages as per the needs of vulnerable groups and gender. The services at present
are not informed by the needs and preferences of these groups.
• Disseminate information on established complaint mechanisms (e.g., toll-free number) so communities
can file their concerns and provide feedback on BR services.
Recommendation 2: UNICEF PCO’s technical assistance has demonstrated successful
implementation of BR reforms. There is an underlined need for continued engagement of
development partners (including UNICEF) to scale up at the provincial level. The future assistance of
UNICEF should focus on:
• Continuing support to provinces with the above-listed actions (where provincial authorities are advised to
seek technical assistance from development partners) to enable further reforms to the BR system in order
for provinces to have a functional CRVS.
• Future assistance must include province-specific targets and assistance plans (enabling addressing local
challenges). The results framework and ToC should be consistent with Result Based Management
principles including intended impact and associated indicators. Moreover, future assistance should be
guided by a documented Exit Plan
• Continued advocacy with provincial and national authorities to prioritise functioning CRVS and wider
access to CRVS data for possible use of data for development planning and resource allocations.
Moreover, advocate with Planning and Development (P&D) and Finance Departments for additional
financial allocations for LGDs to upscale DBR.
• Budgeting which should follow activity-based costing (ABC) principles and must be linked to programme
results/outcomes. The expenditures statements should be linked to outcomes/results to enable usable
computation and analysis (for internal and external review).

Chapter 1: Introduction, Context and the Object of Evaluation
This is the final report of the Summative Evaluation of the Digital Birth Registration Programme
(2017-2021) in Pakistan, (hereinafter referred to as DBR or the Programme) supported jointly by the
United Nations Children’s Fund Pakistan Country Office (UNICEF PCO) and Telenor Pakistan28 (a
mobile service operator). DBR aimed to accelerate birth registration (BR) of children under 17 years
with a special focus on children under five (U5) as a means to contribute to universal birth registration
(UBR) of children. The Programme was implemented in two phases (Phase I and II), between 2017 and
2021 in selected districts of Punjab and Sindh provinces. Phase I (2017-2018) was implemented in five
districts (Bahawalpur, Pakpattan, Thatta, Badin and Naushahro Feroze) whereas Phase II (2019-2020)
was expanded to four additional districts (including Lahore, Multan, Dera Ghazi (D.G.) Khan and
Karachi). This intervention was led and implemented by two local government departments: the
Government of Punjab’s (GoP) Local Government and Community Development Department
(LG&CDD) and the Government of Sindh’s (GoS) Local Government Department (LGD). Other public
sector agencies which supported the implementation include the Health Department (in Sindh only) and
the Social Welfare Department (SWD) in both provinces.

Birth registration is the permanent and universal recording of 1

of his/her existence and identification. Not only is BR a

the prevalence of BR (such as urban vs. rural; rich vs. poor; girls vs. boys) that necessitate more
investments to meet Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 16.9 by 2030.35
Regional Birth Registration Context: South Asia is home to the largest share of children U5 without
a birth certificate. The reasons behind this can be broadly identified as the fee to acquire a birth
certificate, long travel to BR points and judicial costs (incurred to meet legal processes or
requirements).36 The regional situation in South Asia shows an upward spike in BR rates, from around
23 per cent in 2000 to 70 per cent in 2019.37 Nevertheless, achievement against SDG 16.9 is likely
to fall short for the region as the births of 1 in 3 children U5 have never been recorded (i.e., 103
million).38 The systematic recording of births in many South Asian countries remains a serious
challenge, highlighting the urgent need to improve and strengthen CRVS.
Pakistan Birth Registration Context: Figure 10: National and Provincial BR Rates
Pakistan is situated in South Asia with a
population of about 220.8 million (2020)39
and an annual growth rate of 2 per cent.40
Of the total population, 14.8 per cent41 are
children U5 and nearly half of the
population is under 18 years.42 Pakistan
is a federation of four provinces (Punjab,
Sindh, Balochistan and Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa); a federal capital territory
(Islamabad); and two autonomous
territories (Gilgit Baltistan and Azad
Jammu and Kashmir).43
Birth registration in Pakistan is regulated
by national and provincial laws and a
series of international commitments (such
as the SGDs and the Convention on
Rights of the Child44 (CRC) 1989 – Article
7 and 8). As per Pakistan’s National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) Ordinance 2000, it
is compulsory for every newborn child to be registered. In addition, as per the mandate of the provincial
Local Government Act, Union Administration is responsible to maintain the BR system and issue birth
certificates. Despite the legal landscape aiming for UBR, only about 42.2 per cent of children U5 are
registered and 36 per cent have a birth certificate (2017-2018).45 Within the context of regional BR
rates, Pakistan currently holds the second lowest position in South Asia for the registration of children
U5.46 Figure 247 shows the national and provincial BR rates of children U5 which vary significantly from
province to province, where nearly 58 per cent children U5 are registered in Punjab compared to only
about 19 per cent in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. For more details, refer to Appendix 3 for provincial BR rate
of children U5 by locality and economic background.
Various demand and supply side barriers (See Table 1)48 contribute to the low BR rate; however, the
most pressing ones are listed below (refer to Appendix 4 for more details).

Supply Side Barriers
Complex BR • Applicable legal frameworks governing BR are out of date/not fully aligned with international minimum
process standards.
• Bureaucratic hurdles and lengthy processing times sometimes used as a means to obtain bribes from citizens
to expedite the registration process.
Cost • Direct and indirect costs are barriers. According to the survey conducted by UNICEF in Pakistan in 2015,
registering a birth through the traditional process costs the average household PKR49297 (USD50$3.00) in Sindh
and PKR736 (USD$7.40) in Punjab, equivalent to the average daily wage in some communities.
Distance/ • The UC office can be far from communities and pose as a challenge for those who lack means of transportation.
Accessibility
Demand Side Barriers
Limited • Parents often face barriers to registration that stem from illiteracy and confusion over how to complete the
awareness of registration process.
and importance • There are no ‘written rules’ in Pakistan that require evidence of BR when enrolling children in school, accessing
of BR health services, registering for Pakistani citizenship, or obtaining a national identity card.
Cultural barriers • Due to the existence of a number of gender biases, some parents may not be inclined to register their female
children, as they do not anticipate that their daughters will engage in any form of public life.
1.2 Programme Overview (Object of Evaluation)
The following section provides details on the intervention under evaluation. It includes the DBR
Programme’s overview, intended results, strategies, timeline and geographic spread, stakeholders and
their roles, participants, resources, programme significance and Theory of Change (ToC).
1.2.1 Programme Overview
From 2014 to 2016, the DBR Programme was launched as a pilot in three Union Councils (UCs) of
Punjab and Sindh (Kaliana, Dhabeji and Gharo). The pilot phase proved successful and led to an
increase in BR rates across all three UCs: 180 per cent in Kaliana; 396 per cent in Dhabeji; and 44 per
cent in Gharo, where nearly 50 per cent were girls in all three UCs.51 In 2017, based on the success of
the pilot, UNICEF in partnership with Telenor, launched DBR to strengthen structures, systems and
capacities to achieve UBR for children (under 17 years with special focus on children U5) in nine target
districts of two provinces: Punjab (five districts) and Sindh (four districts) by 2021. DBR introduced a
new approach using community-based gatekeepers to act as either mobile (i.e., Marriage Registrars
or Lady Health Workers (LHWs)) or stationary (i.e., Telenor agents or Sahoolat Ghar52) birth reporting
facilitators. Gatekeepers used a mobile application (developed by Telenor) which digitized the BR
application form. A web-based dashboard was developed which provides real-time data on reported
and registered births. Refer to Figure 3 for comparison between the old BR system and the DBR
approach.

On the supply side, using digital technology for registering births, DBR aimed to transform the old
manual BR system to a technology-based system for service provision. The involvement of gatekeepers
facilitated collecting data (child’s birth date, parents’ details, national identity card numbers and
photographs) in the community, reducing the need for repeated visits to the UC office. Alternatively,
parents could visit DBR franchises (Telenor distribution centres), where facilitators enter BR data on
the application. On the demand side, the Programme conducted awareness campaigns in each target
district to ensure strengthened and continual demand for BR services. So far, the intervention has
resulted in the BR of approximately 2.6 million boys and girls in the nine target districts of Punjab and
Sindh as of the end of 2021.53
Programme Goal and Objectives: The Programme aimed to contribute to the ultimate achievement
of UBR for children in all target districts before the end of 2021.54 The Programme was
implemented in two phases and the objectives of each phase are listed in Table 2 below. For
programme outcomes and outputs, refer to Appendix 5 for the Results Framework.

Programme Resources: The Programme’s total Figure 31: Programme Budget
budget (financial contribution) for both phases is
USD$1.4 million funded by Telenor (refer to Figure
5).61 Telenor Pakistan provided in-kind contribution of
USD$681,50062 in Phase II (which includes upgraded
devices – 4,100 tablets, refresher trainings for
facilitators, technology revamp, IT infrastructure and
subsidized internet bundles). The evaluation team did
not receive information on the financial contribution
made by provincial governments between 2017 and
2021.
1.3 Significance of the Programme
The Programme is significant for multiple
stakeholders in following ways:
1. It holds significance for the provincial governments of Punjab and Sindh as it envisaged digitization
of the BR system and improvements to the old system of BR by engaging community gatekeepers
as a means to accelerate BR rates. This approach enabled both the provincial and federal
governments to deliver on their constitutional and policy commitments around human rights and
development results such as SDG 16.9.
2. It holds importance for enabling the GoP and GoS to set up a functioning and usable CRVS system,
which may inform policy and planning decisions around child-related development services such
as health, education and others.
3. The Programme set up a ‘Birth Registration Dashboard’ which provides real-time statistics on
reported and registered births and up-to-date information on the status of each BR application. This
information can potentially help provincial governments to plan and implement development plans.
4. The Programme holds importance to showcase the successes to upscale BR services to other parts
of the provinces and countries that are struggling with low BR rates. The successful approaches
and interventions could guide other provinces and countries to contextualise and revamp/digitize
the BR system.
5. It holds significance for being a test case to see how increased BR rates affect or contribute to
improved access to children’s rights (such as education, health and others) and safeguards them
from child protection risks such as child labour, early marriages, child trafficking and others.
1.4 Programme Theory of Change (ToC)
The Programme has been implemented with a documented ToC (refer Figure 6 for visual
representation). The DBR Programme is based on the following logic: If DBR is implemented across
Punjab and Sindh; if a legislative and regulatory framework to register children without parental care is
developed; if a comprehensive multi-sectoral CRVS strategy is developed with clear modalities for
embedding provincial BR data into the national CRVS system, then by 2022, 65 per cent of U5 children
(girls and boys) will be registered in Pakistan, with UBR achieved and embedded within CRVS for at
least two provinces of Pakistan. Refer to Chapter 4 (Section EQ4.2) for the evaluation team’s
assessment on validity and completeness of the ToC.

intent to generate lessons and list recommendations for governments (around replication and
upscaling) and UNICEF PCO around added focus for assistance in the future. The intended users
include relevant government institutions; UNICEF Pakistan; other UNICEF country offices implementing
programmes on BR; and CSOs/NGOs working in the BR domain.
The evaluation objectives (rephrased and approved by the Evaluation Reference Group (ERG)) are as
below:
• To assess the Programme’s achievements vis-à-vis intended results, and to determine the
programme’s relevance, coherence, efficiency, effectiveness, impact and sustainability;
• To identify strengths and weaknesses of various strategies and models implemented under the
DBR Programme;
• To define the relevance of birth registration to other sectors such as health and education;
• To assess the extent to which the birth registration strategies and key interventions integrated equity
and gender in its design, implementation and monitoring; and
• To identify lessons learnt and formulate recommendations for improved systemic design and
delivery including identification of priority areas for UNICEF PCO country programme for children
(2023-2027).

Chapter 3: Evaluation Design, Methodology, Quality Assurance and
Ethics
This chapter presents the evaluation methodology and management approach, including evaluation
design, methodology, data sources, sampling strategy and quality assurance mechanisms and
compliance to evaluation norms and standards (i.e., United Nation’s Evaluation Group’s (UNEG) Norms
and Standards 2017). The chapter also outlines evaluation limitations and mitigation measures.
3.1 Evaluation Design
This evaluation was guided by two overarching approaches (i.e., Theory-based64 and Participatory65).
Use of the theory-based approach enabled the evaluation team to assess how causal linkages have
worked to achieve intended results and objectives. Using the participatory approach, the evaluation
team engaged and interacted with all relevant stakeholders, including rights-holders (parents of children
U5), duty-bearers (provincial and district authorities of Sindh and Punjab) and the donor (UNICEF and
Telenor), particularly the members of the ERG whose input informed the evaluation.
The evaluation team employed a Hybrid Evaluation Design,66 comprising two sub-designs (i.e.,
Contribution Analysis67 and Quasi Experimental68 design). Contribution Analysis design was used
to track if/how inputs and activities resulted in outcome level changes. The evaluation team used the
ToC to establish if and to what extent desired outcome change has happened and how far programme-
supported activities and inputs contributed to the realisation of assumed change. For this, the evaluation
team utilized secondary data (progress reports, BR weekly statistics, budgets, national/provincial
policies and plans) and primary data (household surveys (HHS), key informant interviews (KIIs) and
focus group discussions (FGDs)) to measure the Programme’s achievements in outcomes and outputs
as indicated in the ToC (refer to Section EQ4.2 for findings). Quasi-experimental design was used to
establish how demand-side interventions (aimed at community education/sensitization) have worked to
increase uptake of BR services. The evaluation team designed and implemented a Knowledge, Attitude
and Practices (KAP) survey to map relevant awareness and behavioural changes in the community,
particularly parents and caregivers. As there was no baseline data (for before/after comparison), the
evaluation team collected single interval/point data from both intervention and control communities to
establish the difference that community awareness interventions made for improved BR.
3.2 Evaluation Methods
Keeping in view evaluation expectations, Figure 51: Evaluation Methods
the evaluation team employed a Mixed-
Methods approach.69 The mixed method
approach applied both quantitative and
qualitative data collection methods which
addressed method-related limitations and
complemented each other. Moreover, use
of both quantitative and qualitative
approaches enabled collecting rich and
comprehensive evidence to respond to the
evaluation questions and expectations.
The approach also enabled cross-
verification or validation of data gathered
from different sources (both primary and
secondary sources) to achieve in-depth,
coverage, authenticity, reliability and
triangulation of findings/results. The evaluation methods are described in the following sections:
64 Participatory Evaluation is an approach that involves the stakeholders of a programme or policy in the evaluation process.
<https://www.betterevaluation.org/en/plan/approach/participatory_evaluation>.
65 Theory-based approaches to evaluation use an explicit theory of change to draw conclusions about whether and how an intervention contributed to observed results.
https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/audit-evaluation/centre-excellence-evaluation/theory-based-approaches-evaluation-concepts-practices.html.
66 Hybrid Evaluation Design is a combination of two or more research methodologies—both qualitative and/or quantitative. Further, it can be conducted in a series (iteratively) or
in parallel (at the same time). <https://www.gutcheckit.com/blog/hybrid-research/>.
67 Contribution analysis explores attribution through assessing the contribution a programme is making to observed results.
<https://www.betterevaluation.org/plan/approach/contribution_analysis>.
68 Quasi-experimental research designs, like experimental designs, test causal hypotheses. It identifies a comparison group that is as similar as possible to the treatment group in
terms of baseline (pre-intervention) characteristics. The comparison group captures what would have been the outcomes if the programme had not been implemented (i.e., the
counterfactual). <https://www.betterevaluation.org/sites/default/files/Quasi-Experimental_Design_and_Methods_ENG.pdf>.
69 A mixed-method evaluation systematically integrates two or more evaluation methods, potentially at every stage of the evaluation process, usually drawing on both quantitative
and qualitative data. <https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1870/Mixed_Methods_Evaluations_Technical_Note.pdf>.

3.2.1 Desk Review
The evaluation team reviewed 174 documents (such as the programme proposal, progress and financial
reports, BR law and policies). The desk review remained an ongoing process throughout the evaluation
as it enabled a better understanding of the context, interventions, results, challenges and learning. A
systematic approach was applied during desk research. This entailed initial screening and classification
(documents were organized and catalogued according to the type of documents), broader themes were
identified (keeping in view the evaluation matrix), and relevant information was extracted using word
search and general reading. The information gathered was used to appropriately respond to evaluation
questions either on its own or with the primary data collected through field research. Refer to Appendix
7 that provides a complete list of documents reviewed during evaluation.
3.2.2 Quantitative Data Collection
For quantitative data
Figure 55: HHS Sample Distribution
collection, the evaluation
team conducted HHSs in 864
sampled households70
(including 431 male and 433
female respondents) to
understand the KAP around
BR of parents and primary
caregivers aged 18-65 years.
The sample size is
considered appropriate to
study and compare the
desired aspects (KAP of
communities) of old vs DBR
system /services at the
community level. The sample
size complies with most
research study standards,
using 95 per cent confidence
level, with an accuracy of ± 5
per cent, which is generally
recommended (refer to
Figure 9 for sample
distribution by the district).
The sampling strategy is mentioned below:
• At the first stage of sampling, each province (i.e., Punjab and Sindh) were divided into treatment
(where the UNICEF has implemented DBR) and control (districts with no exposure to programme
activities) groups.
• For the second stage of sampling, the evaluation team purposively71 selected the treatment districts
from the first and second phase of the Programme. The rationale behind selecting these districts is
to capture transition and changes (if any) made in strategies and approaches.
• Additionally, the evaluation team purposively selected non-exposed districts as control group that
were similar in socio-economic characteristics to the treatment groups (refer to Table 8).
• At the third stage, the total sample size of 864 households was allocated between treatment and
control groups (i.e., 384 households (96 households per district) from control districts in Punjab and
Sindh; and 480 households (120 households per district) from treatment districts of both provinces).
• The fourth stage involved simple random selection of primary sampling units, in this case, UC/town
committee/municipal committees from each survey district. For sample allocation to primary
sampling units, the Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) method72 was used as reference point.
The selected districts in the treatment group included two districts from each province: Bahawalpur
and Pakpattan (Punjab) and Badin and Thatta (Sindh). Whereas the control districts in the provinces
70 The sample size was calculated using the Cochran Statistics. The Cochrane’s Q test provides a method for testing for differences between three or more matched sets of
frequencies or proportions. <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK53317/table/ch3.t2/>.
71 Purposive sampling, also known as judgmental, selective or subjective sampling, is a form of non-probability sampling in which researchers rely on their own judgment when
choosing members of the population to participate in their study. <https://www.betterevaluation.org/en/resources/overview/purposive sampling>.
72 LQAS methodology provides real-time planning and management information. It uses small sample sizes to classify administrative geographical areas, to inform if these areas
have achieved or not a pre-determined target for a given indicator. <https://www.elrha.org/project/lot-quality-assurance-sampling-lqas-survey-techniques>.

are Rahim Yar Khan and Rajanpur (Punjab) and Mirpur Khas and Sujawal (Sindh). The rationale
behind selecting these control districts was similarity in their socio-economic characteristics to the
treatment districts as indicated below.

More details on the survey universe, sampling size, frame and rationale, and strategies used for
selection of households and respondents are given in the Appendix 8. For HHS tool and consent forms
refer to Appendix 9.
3.2.3 Qualitative Data Collection
Qualitative data collection methods used in this evaluation include KIIs and FGDs. Before providing
details on each individual method, the following description highlights the sampling approach that was
applied to select respondents for qualitative data collection methods.
Sampling for Qualitative Methods: In terms of geographic focus, the evaluation team selected the
same districts where the HHS was undertaken. In this regard, four out of nine target districts
(Bahawalpur, Pakpattan, Thatta and Badin) were selected in Punjab and Sindh for KIIs and FGDs. The
evaluation team employed a purposive sampling approach to identify the respondents of KIIs and FGDs.
The selection of KII respondents was mainly driven by the purpose of involving all those stakeholders
who have been involved directly or indirectly in programme design and implementation. This ensured
gathering of a diverse range of opinions to inform the evaluation findings. For FGDs, the same
communities were selected where HHS was completed. The descriptions below outline the key aspects
of each data collection method.
Key Informant Interviews (KIIs): Figure 72: KII Distribution
The evaluation team conducted
37 KIIs (9 females and 28 males)
with key decision-makers at the
national, provincial and district
levels. The evaluation team used
semi-structured guidelines (refer
to Appendix 10 for KII tools and
consent forms) to interview key
informants. The KIIs focused on
identifying the needs on the
ground in terms of bottlenecks;
alignment of programme design
with national/provincial plans;
efficacy of the DBR model and
approaches; key achievements
and challenges; and enabling and
disabling factors. Figure 10
presents the distribution of KIIs.

Focus Group Discussions (FGDs): The evaluation team conducted 26 FGDs (68 female and 220
male) to understand opinions and perceptions of the stakeholders at the community level. These
included rights-holders (parents and primary caregivers of children U5), service providers
(district/community level BR staff/focal persons/facilitators from LG, BR focal persons from health and
education departments) and community influencers (community leaders/elders, religious leaders). The
FGDs were conducted using a set of structured questions (refer to Appendix 12 for FGD guides and
consent forms). The enquiry focused on understanding bottlenecks associated with BR services, and
benefits of the DBR model/services, bottlenecks and segments that are still left out, and ideas for
improving services for different community groups. The distribution of FGDs is given in Figure 11. Refer
to Appendix 13 on the distribution of FGDs by each sampled district.
Figure 112: FGD Participants by Category
3.3 Data Processing and Analysis
A parallel mixed-methods data analysis approach was employed whereby data from each strand
(qualitative and quantitative) was collated, processed and analysed simultaneously, yet separately for
comparison and interpretation to develop findings.
Qualitative Data Analysis: A systematic and structured content and thematic analysis of the qualitative
data collected through FGDs and KIIs was conducted. The process entailed in-depth review (using
MaxQDA software) of the collected data and summarizing the unstructured textual content into
manageable data relevant to the evaluation criteria. Following this, relevant/important data was
identified and coded before being grouped into common themes. The summarised and analysed data
was grouped into matrices to extract the emerging patterns on various programmatic features and
participant viewpoints. To arrive at reliable judgments and conclusions, all significant findings were
triangulated with secondary sources of data.
Quantitative Data Analysis: The survey data was collected using pen and paper personal interview
whereby data was manually entered into a database and checked for validation and verification. The
quantitative data analysis utilized cross-tabulation and frequency tables using SPSS76 (see Appendix
14 for HHS Data Analysis Plan and Appendix 15 for HHS tabulations). Findings from the analysis of
HHS results were corroborated and triangulated with qualitative data and secondary information to
formulate valid arguments against the evaluation questions and sub-questions. The evaluation team
also utilized and analysed data from secondary sources (progress reports, budget/expense sheets, etc)
to validate and triangulate evaluation findings.
3.4 Quality Assurance of the Data Collection
The evaluation team placed conscious data quality measures to ensure reliable and accurate data
collection. A brief overview of the quality assurance mechanisms is presented below, for more details
refer to Appendix 16.
Field Staff Training: A cascade training approach was implemented with a two-day training delivered
to two Master Trainers (MT) (one male and one female) on HHS, KIIs and FGDs in April 2022. These
MTs trained the field staff (25 male and 25 female data collectors) in their respective provinces
separately on both quantitative and qualitative tools. The training focused on providing an orientation
on programme interventions, evaluation purpose, and objectives and evaluation data collection tools.
Special emphasis was given to explain the UNEG/UNICEF guidelines, norms and field protocols to
76 Statistical Package for the Social Sciences.
SUMMATIVE EVALUATION OF DIGITAL BIRTH REGISTRATION PROGRAMME 2017-2021
15
ensure all ethical guidelines are completely understood for correct application during field data
collection, especially while interacting with communities (refer to Appendix 17 for Training Agenda).
Pre-testing and Mock Sessions: The survey tool (HHS questionnaire) was pre-tested in 32
households in a community near the training centre in Lahore. The pretesting exercise aimed to test
the tool and allow the evaluation to make any necessary revisions (minor edits to the skip patterns and
translation). The evaluation team shared the results of the pretesting exercise with UNICEF.
Spot and Back Checks: The evaluation team Figure 116: Quality Measures Implemented
deployed a team of field monitors to conduct spot
checks of HHSs and FGDs (refer to Appendix 18 for
the spot check tool). The field monitors observed
enumerators to verify whether methodology and tools
were accurately administered. The field monitors
briefed the evaluation team on a daily basis for any
course correction, if needed. In addition, the evaluation
team reviewed all KII and FGD transcripts for accuracy
and completeness. In case of the HHS, 10 per cent of
the collected data and entries in the database were
cross-checked to ensure consistency, accuracy and
completeness of the survey data.
Preliminary Findings and Validation Workshop:
The evaluation team held a session on July 20, 2022,
to present preliminary findings to UNICEF.
Additionally, one-day validation workshop was
organized with key programme stakeholders to
validate the findings and recommendations after the
submission of the draft evaluation report.
Ethical Clearance: In consultation with UNICEF, the
evaluation team did not require an external ethical
review for this evaluation as per the criteria set in
‘UNICEF Procedure on Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation, Data collection and Analysis
(2021)’.77
3.5 Integration of HRBA, Gender Equality, and Equity in Evaluation
The UNICEF’s cross-cutting programming priorities (i.e., HRBA, gender equality, and equity) were
considered across all stages of the evaluation – design, implementation, analysis and reporting. Find
below how the evaluation team integrated these aspects into the evaluation:
Table 9: Integration of HRBA, Gender Equality and Equity in the Evaluation
Evaluation Phase Measures Taken for Compliance
Design • The evaluation matrix included a separate section to include specific questions, sub-questions and indicators
on gender equality, HRBA and equity.
• The selection of evaluation methods ensured inclusion or participation of duty-bearers and rights-holders
(male/female, rural/urban, literate/illiterate, etc.).
• Specific guides were applied for each stakeholder (duty-bearers, rights-holders, donors) under each
evaluation method (KII or FGD).
• Separate FGDs were planned with female respondents to cater to cultural barriers. Appropriate capacity-
building of all evaluation team members was ensured.
Implementation • Gender balanced teams were deployed for data collection.
• Limited female representatives in DBR and purposive sampling of KII respondents resulted in lower
representation of female respondents in KIIs (9 out of 37 respondents were female). Similarly, for FGDs the
defined respondent categories (UC secretaries, Nikkah registrars, community influencers and parents) were
male-dominated resulting in limited inclusion of female respondents (68 out of 288). To address the gender
gap and obtain female perspective, the evaluation team reached out to an equal number of male and female
respondents for the HHS (431 male and 433 female). In total 1,189 participants were reached via HHS, KIIs
and FGDs, out of which 510 were female (43%) and 679 were male (57%).

• Out of 1,189 participants, 142 were duty-bearers (11.9%), 1 was CSO representative (0.1%) and 1,046 were
rights-holders (87%).
• The HHS included economically disadvantaged households; where out of 864, 92.7% of respondents had a
monthly income of less than PKR25,000.
Analysis and • Analysis of all data was disaggregated by parameters of gender equality, HRBA and equity.
Reporting • Distinct coding for gender equality, HRBA and equity was implemented to extract themes.
• The synthesis of evaluation findings, conclusion and recommendations were informed with the above key
considerations.
3.6 Compliance to UNEG/UNICEF Norms and Ethical Standards
The evaluation adhered to all applicable UNEG78 and UNICEF adapted norms and ethical standards as
prescribed in the relevant key guiding documents. The description below outlines key aspects of each
dimension (for a detailed description, refer to Appendix 19).
• Independence and Impartiality: The evaluation team ensured independence during all phases of
the evaluation. The team members had no conflict of interest and played no role in the
implementation of programme activities.
• Credibility: The evaluation employed an inclusive and participatory data collection methodology
(involving a range of relevant stakeholders for feedback) and triangulation of reported findings by
using an analysis of evidence from both secondary and primary data sources.
• Utility: UNICEF plans to disseminate the evaluation report with provincial governments and all
other stakeholders after due quality assurance (GEROS assessment) and approval of the
evaluation report.
• Professionalism: The evaluation team comprised professionals with extensive knowledge,
training, and experience working with multiple clients on local and international projects.
• Privacy of Participants: Privacy and confidentiality of participants were maintained, and findings
were summarized to appropriate aggregation level.
• Avoidance of Harm: The evaluation team took pre-emptive measures for any unforeseen events
in the field and respond accordingly. Considering COVID-19, the field team maintained distance
from each other as well as respondents, wore masks, and washed their hands regularly during
fieldwork.
3.7 Limitations, Challenges and Mitigation Measures
Table 10 below outlines limitations and the mitigation measures to address constraints.
Table 10: Limitations and Mitigation Measures
Limitations and Challenges Mitigation Measures
Unavailability of baseline data around community KAP To address this, a household KAP survey was undertaken to measure
for before-after comparison (to conclude on programme changes in parents/primary caregivers’ knowledge around BR. To establish
effectiveness in terms of generating demand). programme contributions to this, data was gathered from control groups (in
non-programme districts) and was compared with the treatment groups. The
use of a ‘counterfactual’ enabled the evaluation team to assess programme
contributions to change in knowledge of parents/caregivers.
Delay in approval of inception report and initiation of Several rounds of feedback and delay in approval of inception report
fieldwork. extended the overall evaluation timeline. To address this, a no-cost
extension of two months was sought.
Availability of key UNICEF and public sector staff who Several key stakeholders (especially those involved at the design stage)
remained involved in design and implementation of DBR were not working with the Programme anymore. To mitigate this, the
activities. evaluation team requested UNICEF to arrange interviews with the most
relevant stakeholders even if they were no longer engaged.
Data limitations constrained impact and efficiency Long term goal statement from ToC was used as replacement including
analysis (results framework is without impact statement proxy impact level results in terms of improved child wellbeing and improved
and indicators and limited information on budgeting is child protection. Additionally, for analysis of efficiency, the available figure
available). for the total budget has been used for cost/beneficiary analysis.
Unavailability of pre-DBR BR rates or latest provincial or The evaluation team has relied on primary data to assess the quantum of
district-wise BR numbers. change, however, due to unavailability of pre-DBR BR rates or latest
provincial or district BR rates, the team is unable to validate the quantum of

3.8 Evaluation Management, Team and Implementation Phases
This section details the evaluation management arrangements, evaluation team and roles,
implementation phases and deliverables under each evaluation phase.
3.8.1 Evaluation Management – Evaluation Reference Group (ERG)
The evaluation is commissioned by UNICEF PCO and led by UNICEF’s Social Policy (Evaluation and
Research) section, with coordination support from the Child Protection section focal points. To provide
overall advisory and technical support, UNICEF formed an ERG comprising representatives from
UNICEF (including provincial), key government stakeholders and Telenor Pakistan. Broadly, the ERG
had the following responsibilities:

Chapter 4: Evaluation Findings, Analysis and Preliminary
Conclusions
This chapter presents the evaluation findings and preliminary conclusions. The description includes key
findings drawn from both primary and secondary sources. The findings are structured separately for
each of the evaluation criterion (i.e., relevance, coherence, efficiency, effectiveness, impact and
sustainability), and UNICEF programming priorities treated as non-DAC criteria (i.e., gender equality,
equity, HRBA and DRR). The findings for each question/sub-question are separately outlined and the
section ends with preliminary conclusions (listed in boxes at the end of each sub-question). The findings
have been presented as succinctly as possible and where needed associated details are appended.

EQ1.2 - To what extent did the Programme interventions address supply and demand side bottlenecks
(keeping in view the local context – political stability, population movement and emergencies) for
families/caregivers?
The findings are divided into two parts. The first part outlines the findings around the process
undertaken to identify supply and demand side bottlenecks (resulting in low uptake of BR services).
The second part highlights programme strategies/interventions that aimed to address the identified
(supply and demand side) bottlenecks.

stationary registrars (or ‘gatekeepers’) that can register births free of charge. However, communities
were still required to travel to the UC office to collect the birth certificate and pay a fee to the UC
office. Discussions with community members indicate that this cost varies and at times they have to
pay bribes to the UC staff in order to receive the certificate.
Preliminary Conclusions: Relevance
REL 1: The Programme’s design is relevant for alignment of DBR goals, objectives and strategies with those of national policies and
plans (i.e., National Framework on CRVS Reforms (2020)) and provincial BR strategies (Punjab Birth Registration Strategy 2016 and
Birth Registration Strategy Sindh 2018-2022). There are overlaps with respect to achieving/accelerating UBR (goal), implementing
innovative technologies and strengthening legislative frameworks for improved service delivery (objectives). The strategies are aligned
as national and provincial policies underline improved institutional capacities and coordination; demand creation through behavioural
change; and others.
REL 2: Programme design is informed by primary and secondary data available in the form of multiple studies and assessments including:
WHO’s Rapid Assessment (2013), Feasibility Study (UNICEF 2014), MICS 2014 for Sindh and Punjab, and GSMA Study (2016). The
design is mostly appropriate for addressing both (identified and prioritised) supply and demand side bottlenecks. The interventions
included: i) training and skills development of LG and facilitators/gatekeepers to address limited capacities in the use of digital
technologies; ii) expanding BR services by evolving partnerships with health, community influencers and private sector operators; iii) and
increasing uptake of BR services by educating and sensitizing communities/parents on the importance and process. There are some
design deficiencies such as: two-step registration and certification process instead of the recommended one visit/single step approach;
record keeping is complex as UC Secretaries are required to make separate entries for DBR (LG system) and NADRA systems;
certification isbeing issued through the old system requiring parents/caregivers to pay for certificates which may involve multiple visits.
4.2 Coherence
EQ2 - To what extent did the Programme complement relevant public sector efforts and are
the interventions consistent with international guidelines/standards?
The coherence criterion has one key question and two sub-questions.
EQ2.1 - To what extent did DBR interventions complement ongoing provincial government activities for
birth registration?
Keeping in view the evaluation expectations, the findings (drawn from desk review and discussions with
key stakeholders including UNICEF and LG departments) below outline how DBR interventions
complement ongoing provincial BR priorities/interventions. Due to the similar nature of DBR
interventions in both provinces and to avoid overlaps, findings for both provinces are presented
together.
Table 13: DBR’s Complementarities with Ongoing Provincial BR Priorities/Interventions
BR Priorities/ Findings (Punjab and Sindh)
Interventions
Accelerated birth To accelerate the BR progress, the DBR Programme supported both provinces in establishing a dedicated DBR
registration rates Cell at provincial LG departments. This DBR cell was equipped with technological infrastructure (computers,
back up servers, internet connectivity and power backups) and human resources to adopt the digital BR model.
This capacitated both provincial governments to introduce the digital BR model in nine target districts.
Updated BR policy The DBR Programme supported both provincial governments to improve the legal and administrative framework
and frameworks in order to strengthen the BR services. A series of consultations were held with respective local government
departments in Sindh and Punjab to review and revise the bye-laws in Sindh and Birth and Death Registration
Rules in Punjab.
Interoperability with The DBR Programme was led by the LG department which partnered with NADRA, social welfare, health, and
other sectors for BR education departments to support social mobilization and BR process as per their mandated activities.
Capacity building of The DBR Programme provided trainings to LG staff (at UC level). In Sindh, 289 UC clerks were trained on BR

EQ2.2 - To what extent programme strategies/interventions are consistent with international
standards/guidelines?
Multiple international agencies are involved with developing guidelines to strengthen CRVS (including
BR) across the globe. These include UNICEF, United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), United
Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) and others.84 For the
following assessment, the evaluation team has conducted a comparative analysis of the DBR
Programme with UNICEF’s BR Programming Guide (2013).85 For a comparative analysis with other
international (including SDGs) and regional frameworks, refer to Appendix 24.

children in nine districts.86
• The DBR-supported technology enabled timely and accurate information
sharing at multiple levels. Validation by NADRA and issuance of a CRSM
number added further to accuracy.
• Review of relevant laws indicate that BR is not compulsory in Pakistan. It is a
prerequisite to obtaining a birth certificate, which in Pakistan is needed for a
national identity card, passport and school enrolment (but this is not applicable
to all provinces).
• DBR implemented demand generation interventions, however programme

level steering committee meetings.
Preliminary Conclusions: Coherence
COH 1: The DBR Programme is assessed as mostly coherent in terms of supporting the provinces with accelerating UBR and creating a
digital BR model in accordance with the listed policy/programming priorities available in provincial BR policy documents. The Programme
is complementing efforts around: i) accelerating BR rates by simplifying the process; revising policies and procedures/rules of business;
introducing interoperability with other sectors (engaging other actors such as health, education, social welfare and others for BR); building
capacity of LG staff; and devising a digital BR model. Similarly, the DBR complemented the demand creation efforts by engaging with
SWDs and CSOs to sensitize and educate parents and caregivers.
COH 2: The DBR strategies and interventions are largely consistent with UNICEF global guidelines (2013). Consistency is evident in
terms of placing the system within the civil registry/national ID management and being continuous, universal and timely. Inconsistencies
include: BR only being free for limited period (30 days) and parents/caregivers charged for late/delayed registration and certification;
separation of registration and certification possibly involving multiple visits (instead of single visit/one step process); interoperability has
not been institutionalized (in terms of BR included in the job descriptions of relevant health, education and SWD staff); and demand
creation is not monitored (no assessments undertaken on community education).
4.3 Efficiency
EQ3 - To what extent were Programme resources (financial, human resources, supplies)
sufficient (quantity), adequate (quality) and utilized efficiently; and encouraged innovation
to accelerate achievement of results?
The criterion has one key and sub-question each.
EQ3.1 - To what extent were the Programme resources (financial, human resources, supplies) sufficient
(quantity), adequate (quality) and utilized efficiently; and encouraged innovation to accelerate
achievement of results?
The efficiency analysis is primarily drawn using the information shared with the evaluation team
separately by the Programme team (for budget and utilization) and result framework (for targets). The
readers may note that the efficiency analysis is constrained for limited disaggregation of budgets vis a
vis DBR thematic components. The evaluation team has used available data and structured the findings
into multiple sections including: i) efficiency in terms of achievements vs used resources (funds, human
resources and time); ii) innovation-led efficiency; iii) cost efficiency analysis; and iv) completeness and
accuracy of financial information.

take over the DBR Programme. As per the
stakeholders, the no-cost extension was sought to cater to the operational delays associated with
COVID-19. On human resources, the adequacy in terms of numbers did not come up as an issue
during the discussions with key stakeholders but limited digital skills was quoted as a limiting
element (details on the capacity development strategy have been included in the effectiveness
section - EQ4.2).
Innovation-led Efficiency
Based on the evaluation team’s assessment, the following are key innovative approaches used by the
DBR Programme which resulted in efficiency:
• DBR application: The DBR application enabled door-to-door BR service which saved parents both
time and cost for registration. At the service user end, the application saved the UC staff time to
manually enter data and upload it for NADRA’s verification.
• Linkages with other departments for social mobilization: The Programme partnered with
health, SWD and education (LHWs, polio workers, volunteers, CSOs, social workers were
engaged) to leverage available resources for social mobilization. Community meetings, birth
registration camps, street theatre and other demand generation activities were organized to reach
vulnerable communities in targeted districts.
• Community-based facilitators/gatekeepers: Recognizing the importance of making BR
processes less costly and accessible, the DBR Programme introduced the use of community-based
gatekeepers to act as either mobile or stationary birth reporting facilitators. These facilitators were
community-based and provided low-cost solution (compared to hiring new employees) to register
children.
Cost Efficiency Analysis
• Stakeholders shared that a cost efficiency analysis of different DBR interventions was not
undertaken. Though figures are unavailable, discussions with parents indicate that the DBR helped
them save both costs and time due to door-to-door visits or community-based BR camps. As per
the HHS, the cost for BR reported in treatment districts is PKR342 whereas in control districts it is
reported as PKR532.
• From the achievement and expenditures data, the cost/beneficiary comes to USD$0.53/child.
In both provinces, BR and certification is done separately (not a single step). The evaluation team
has calculated the cost/beneficiary to obtain the certificate. As per data received on number of
registered children who received a birth certificate (24 per cent overall),91 the evaluation team has
calculated per child certification cost to be around USD$3.33 (refer to Appendix 23 for calculations).
88 Punjab’s progress for 2021 has not been included as number of registered children in Telenor districts is not available.
89 Progress Reports (January 2017. - December 2018 and October 2019 - December 2021).
90 As highlighted above, there is discrepancy in the proposed budgets and expenditures for Phase I which may have resulted in misleading calculations for Phase I.
91 The evaluation team has used the weekly BR statistics reports to calculate the certification rate. The NADRA validation files shared with the evaluation team do not distinguish
DBR-registered children, with those who obtained the certificate.

EFY 1: The evaluation team has used the expenditures data as the planned budget. From the available data, the Programme managed
to achieve 137% of intended targets (cumulative BR) by using 98% of funds in two phases. In relative terms, Phase I proved less efficient
(for achieving only 73% of registration targets) compared to Phase II during which the Programme exceeded the registration target (i.e.,
achieved 174%). The Programme could be viewed as less efficient (on time sFciagleu)r,e d 1ue4 8to: Pthreo fgarcets thsa at gthaeinses tt aInrgteentsd reedq uRireeds ual tyse ar-long

EQ4.2 - To what extent did DBR strategies/approaches (digitization, PPPs, linkages with relevant
government departments, capacity building, coordination and community awareness) work to enable
achievement of results?
The findings are divided in two parts. The first part provides an overview of the DBR strategies and their
relative effectiveness to achieve intended results. The evaluation team has assessed effectiveness at
two levels: contribution of DBR strategies to the achievement of results and feedback received from the
key stakeholders. The second part includes the evaluation team’s assessment of DBR’s ToC.

• Find below the list of programme strategies/approaches that worked (or remained relatively more
effective) and contributed to achievement of results. The visual (Figure 17) summarises the
assessment (based on results and stakeholder/user experience drawn from primary and secondary
data) while the details are mentioned in the following section.
I. Advocacy and Technical Support for Legislative and Administrative Reforms:
• The DBR Programme technically supported Punjab’s LG&CDD to develop Birth and Death
Registration Rules which were officially notified in May 2021. Similarly, in Sindh, the DBR
Programme supported revision in the bye-laws for registration of birth, death, marriage and divorce.
As per the revisions, a section on DBR was added in the local government structure. The bye-laws
were endorsed by the Sindh Cabinet in April 2021 and await official notification. Based on
discussions with the local government stakeholders, DBR has contributed by providing continued
advocacy and technical support to revise the bye-laws (in Sindh) and BR and Death Rules in
Punjab.
II. Technology Integration in Delivery of BR Services (Digitization)
• The DBR Programme aimed to overhaul the old system by digitizing the BR process. This was done
by developing an android-based application which supported door-to-door visitation by facilitators
to households with unregistered children. The digital application forms were received by the UC
Secretary with details automatically uploaded to a dashboard. This dashboard intended to provide
the UC staff with real-time statistics on registered births. However, discussions with UC Secretaries

working assumptions that underpin the change. There are some gaps such as the indicators for
measuring change are not clearly spelt out and there is no concerted focus on integrating gender
equality and equity in the ToC.
• Validity: The ToC is considered valid. This assertion is drawn based on programme achievements
(at the outcome level) and evidence from the field that points to DBR interventions (as highlighted
above) as key contributors to observed change. The results indicate 42.4 per cent BR rate in
treatment districts compared to 7.6 per cent in control districts (as per the HHS), which shows the
Programme’s contribution to improvement in BR rates. Not only do the causal linkages appear to
have worked in digitizing the process but the working assumptions appear to be valid (e.g., GoP
and GoS have demonstrated commitment and ownership to overhaul the old BR system). It should
be noted that there are no impact and outcomes indicators in the Programme’s results framework.

4.5 Impact
EQ5 – To what extent did the Programme contribute to intended impact (including for whom
and under what circumstances) and to what extent did it produce unintended results?
The impact criterion has one key question with one sub-question.
EQ5.1 - To what extent did the DBR Programme contribute to achievement of intended and unintended
results?
The findings are grouped into two sections whereby first outlines the contributions towards intended
impact and the other highlights unintended impact. The impact assessment is constrained by the fact
that the Programme’s Result Framework and ToC do not include an impact statement and associated
indicators. Keeping in view the limitations, the evaluation team has used the long-lerm objective
statement (in the ToC) as intended impact i.e., “By 2022, 65 per cent of the girls and boys are
registered in Pakistan with UBR achieved and embedded within CRVS systems for at least two
provinces of Pakistan.” Moreover, the evaluation team has taken note of changes in levels of
perception (in the communities) around improved child wellbeing103 and protection104 (used as proxy
indicators).
Contributions to Intended Impact
• The evaluation team is unable to comprehensively assess change as of 2021 due to lack of access
to the latest provincial or district-wise BR numbers. Comparison between the Pakistan
Demographic and Health Survey (PDHS) 2012-2013 (before the initiation of the DBR Programme)
and PDHS 2018-2019 (towards the end of Phase I), show that the provincial BR rate has increased
from 24 per cent to 28 per cent in Sindh and 45 per cent to 58 per cent in Punjab highlighting
that the 65 per cent target (for 2022) is quite ambitious for Sindh.
• Additionally, as per the HHS, the BR rate is around 42 per cent in treatment districts compared
to 7 per cent in control districts highlighting the Programme’s contribution to increase BR rates
in programme districts.

4.6 Sustainability
EQ6 - To what extent have programme interventions/results (including strengthened
government capacity) been sustainable and what factors either contributed to or are likely
to hinder sustainability?
The sustainability criterion has one key evaluation question with one sub question. The DBR
Programme has been implemented without an pre-defined and documented Exit/Sustainability Plan,
however, during implementation the relevant public stakeholders were kept engaged and encouraged
to take over responsibility for continuity and upscaling. This included extending contracts (for several
months in 2020) of DBR supported staff in Punjab, until the government allocated funds (through PC 1)
are available to absorb them (evaluators have no details nor any evidence around staff continuity). The
sustainability assessment remains limited for absence of a documented plan and progress.
EQ6.1 - To what extent have programme interventions and results (including strengthened government
capacity) been sustainable (or otherwise) and what factors (internal and external) have contributed
to/constrained sustainability?
Keeping in view evaluation expectations (and absence of an articulated exit plan), the evaluation team
has listed the DBR interventions and results and rated them on a sustainability scale. The assessment
is primarily based on field findings (drawn from both primary and secondary sources) and the evaluation
team’s own interpretation of findings. The evaluation team has used the following grid for assessment
of sustainability. The rating grid includes three categories (i.e., i) interventions and results that have

been sustained or are likely to be sustainable; ii) interventions and results that have been partially
sustained or are likely to be sustainable; and iii) interventions and results that have not been sustained
or are least likely to be sustainable.

into the CRVS system and scale up services to all 30 districts. This summary was approved in
November 2020 and a CRVS Cell was established in the LGD to integrate BR into CRVS. GoS
allocated PKR21 million for the 2021-2022 financial year to support the initiative. The Chief
Minister of Sindh also notified Karachi Central and Larkana districts to be model CRVS districts

Key Interventions / Results Sustainability Rating and Evaluation Team’s Notes
Sindh does not indicate clear plans on continuing periodic campaigns in target districts. While Punjab
has taken several initiatives, awareness campaigns are not built in the LG&CDD work plan for July-
December 2022.
Preliminary Conclusions: Sustainability
SUS 1: The Programme was implemented without a sustainability or an exit plan. The evaluation team assessed sustainability prospects
for key DBR interventions and results that have been sustained (or otherwise). Despite not having a documented exit strategy, the
Programme has done well with providing technical support for legal and administrative reforms (in Sindh bye-laws for registration of vital
events were amended and await notification and Punjab’s Birth & Death Registration Rules 2021 were drafted and approved). Similarly,
the digital integration in delivery of BR services is evident. For example, in Punjab, the LG&CDD Punjab has allocated resources through
development of PC-I (government planning document) for scaling up to all 36 districts in the form of the Baldia Online application). In
Sindh, the LGD prepared a summary for the Chief Minister of Sindh to embed the DBR model into the CRVS system and scale up services
to all 30 districts.
SUS 2: The Programme’s sustainability prospects for capacity development are relatively lower for continuous need to retrain the human
resources on the upgraded system. On partnerships, the DBR Programme partnered with relevant government departments (health,
education, social welfare) through notifications but is not legally covered for interoperability. Communities are aware of the importance
and procedures of BR, but require recurring awareness campaigns to upkeep the generated demand.
4.7 Gender Equality, Equity, HRBA and DRR
EQ7 - To what extent the DBR (design, implementation, results and monitoring)
demonstrated compliance with gender equality, equity and HRBA principles and
approaches?
A separate criterion was added to the evaluation framework to demonstrate a concerted focus on the
integration of UNICEF’s cross cutting priorities (gender equality, equity, HRBA and DRR) in the DBR
Programme (in terms of design, implementation, monitoring and results). There is one key question
with three sub-questions.
EQ7.1 - To what extent DBR Programme integrated gender equality principles and approaches in
design, planning, implementation and monitoring?
This description presents key findings around the integration of gender equality in the DBR Programme.
A light touch analysis of integration of the United Nations System-Wide Action Plan (UN-SWAP)105 has
been incorporated.
Integration of Gender Equality in DBR Programme
The findings are based on desk review and discussions with key stakeholders (UNICEF, Telenor, public
sector partners) and community members (community influencers, parents, UC staff) and have been
disaggregated at design, implementation and results levels.
Design:
• The Programme’s results framework (Phase I and Phase II) does not include gender-specific
targets. In Phase II, there is one age-specific indicator (i.e., number of children U5 whose birth is
registered in provincial government and NADRA records).
• A structured gender assessment was not undertaken to inform the design. However, the situation
analysis conducted prior to the design of the DBR Programme indicate that parents are: less likely
to register girls as they do not anticipate their engagement in public life.106 The evaluators did not
find interventions that may have had enabled addressing gender specific disparities. While sharing
feedback on draft report, UNICEF team did refer to using monitoring data (periodic analytics) to
address gender inequities, but could not provide evidential substantiation.
Implementation:
• Door-to-door registration service facilitated mothers’

Figure 197: Gender Disaggregation of Registered
• Discussions with community members indicate availability of limited to no female staff at the UC
office meant that mothers were reluctant to visit the UC for BR and certification purposes. The
situation remained unchanged during the implementation of the DBR Programme.
• In Pakistan (especially in rural communities), prevailing gender norms mean men are usually the
decision-makers on matters pertaining to child’s wellbeing (including BR). As per the HHS results,
70 per cent of the respondents indicated that fathers are decision-makers on BR. DBR prioritised
both parents for sensitization activities with messages on the importance of and process of BR of
children.
• There is no secondary evidence which would suggest that specific focus was paid to sensitize
parents on the importance of registering girls to address gender barriers.
• Male and female community influencers were identified and trained to disseminate awareness
messages on BR. Influencers included religious and political leaders, teachers, social workers and
healthcare providers from target UCs.
Results (including monitoring):
• Monitoring of gender and age-specific results was Figure 200: Gender Disaggregation of Registered
undertaken through the BR weekly statistics reports. Children (HH Survey)
Although targets were not defined, the results for 2019
and 2020107 indicate slight gender disparity as 46 per
cent of girls were registered compared to 54 per cent
of boys. These numbers are almost consistent with the
HHS results, where 55 per cent of boys were
registered in treatment districts compared to 45 per
cent of girls (refer to Figure 21). Although, the sex ratio
(male/female) is 103.41 for Punjab and 108.29 for
Sindh.108 However, BR was slightly lower among girls
compared to boys in both provinces (prior to DBR) and
therefore should have been prioritised (as per MICS Punjab 2017-2018, 75.8 per cent of boys are
registered compared to 74.8 per cent of girls and as per MICS Sindh 2018-2019, 34.4 per cent of
boys are registered compared to 33.6 per cent of girls).
• Reporting on other indicators/results remained weak and the results were not gender balanced. For
instance, during Phase II, 3,625 facilitators were trained in Sindh (45 per cent female and 55 per
cent male facilitators). In Punjab, during the same time period, 3,691 facilitators were trained and
only 8 per cent were female facilitators.109 Similarly, the disaggregated number of total male and
female community members who were sensitized on BR through DBR were not consistently
reported in progress reports.110 Data shared separately by UNICEF shows 60 per cent male and
40 per cent female community members were reached through sensitization activities.
• The evaluation team has reviewed the DBR results framework to assess if the design incorporated
gender equality principles as per the UN-SWAP 2.0. There are 17 indicators broadly divided under
results-based management: oversight; accountability; human and financial resources; capacity;
and knowledge, communication and coherence. Of the six indicators that the evaluation team was
able to assess, the DBR Programme is compliant with three and non-compliant with the remaining
three. Refer to Appendix 26 which includes gender equality indicators and the evaluation team’s
assessment of the DBR Programme’s compliance and non-compliance with those indicators.
EQ7.2 - To what extent did the DBR Programme manage to identify, integrate (in terms of indicators,
strategies and resources) and produce results for vulnerable/deprived locations and populations
particularly widows, adolescent mothers, people with disabilities and minorities?
This description presents key findings around the integration of equity in design, implementation and
results. The findings are primarily drawn from desk review and discussions with key stakeholders
(UNICEF, Telenor, public sector partners) and community members (community influencers, parents,
UC staff).

The evaluation team has used UNICEF’s definition of ‘equity’ for equity assessment. For UNICEF,
equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential
without discrimination, bias or favouritism.111
Design:
• The Programme emphasized the inclusion of “Yes, we chose Bahawalpur and Pakpattan not because they are
children from disadvantaged groups in its poor but because they had the lowest registration rates. The areas

vulnerable group. Official
• There are no vulnerability specific indicators in
the Programme’s results framework, such as targeting of disabled and/or children from low-income
quantile households. From an equity perspective, only one intervention was planned (i.e., the
installation of BR camps in remote areas
where low registration numbers were present). Figure 207: BR rates in Target Districts
• Discussions with key stakeholders indicate
that target districts were primarily selected on
the prevalence of low BR rates and population
size. While targeted districts indicate low BR
rates (refer to Figure 23), the evaluation team
noted that there are other districts (in both
provinces) which are more vulnerable in terms
of low BR rates. For instance, in Sindh,
Umerkot and Sujawal’s BR rate in 2014 were
2.9 per cent and 3.4 per cent respectively.112
Similarly, Rajanpur’s BR rate was noted at 26 per cent.113
Implementation:
• Door-to-door service implemented in hard-to-reach areas for vulnerable group (widows, divorced
mothers and communities residing in hard-to-reach areas).
• Community meetings, BR camps, street theatre, IEC material and other demand generation
activities were organized to reach vulnerable communities in targeted districts.
• The access points for BR increased from one office per UC to multiple points offering registration
services, from 800 to 11,000 points. This potentially helped in reducing the indirect costs incurred
by beneficiaries needing to travel to the UC office.
Results:
• The DBR reports do not offer disaggregate results on equity parameters for the evaluation team to
offer any commentary on them. Results from the HHS show that 73 per cent of the registered
children’s household income was less than PKR25,000 indicating inclusion of economically
disadvantaged households. Another 2 per cent of the registered children were reportedly disabled.
EQ7.3 - To what extent the Programme (design, planning, monitoring and implementation) incorporated
HRBA principles and DRR approaches?
This section brings together findings and analysis around the Programme’s compliance with the
HRBA114 principles (i.e., Participation, Accountability, Non-Discrimination and Equality, Empowerment
and Legality (often referred to as PANEL)). The findings are corroborated by both secondary and
primary data.
Integration of HRBA in DBR Programme
Following is the evaluation team’s assessment on the DBR Programme’s compliance with key HRBA
principles.

HRBA Principles Findings and Assessment
Participation115 The design and implementation of the DBR Programme remained inclusive with involvement of both service
providers (duty-bearers) and service users (beneficiaries). The Programme successfully partnered with key
departments (LG&CDD, LGD, SWD, etc.) and built PPP (with Telenor). Interaction with the rights-holders was
ensured where community members such as religious and political leaders, teachers, social workers and
LHWs (in Sindh) were involved. During these awareness campaigns, rights-holders were reached via street
theatre, BR camps, community meetings and printed material.
Accountability116 Desk review indicates that a feedback/grievance system was in place for beneficiaries. However, FGDs and
HHS results indicate that community members were not aware of the feedback mechanism and did not know
how or to whom they had to lodge a complaint if needed.
Non-discrimination The Programme remained largely non-discriminatory (did not discriminate based on identity factors) as
and Equality117 children from all religious, ethnic, income and cultural backgrounds had an equal opportunity to be registered
through the DBR Programme. Discussions with community members (influencers, parents, facilitators)
indicate that the Programme offered equal opportunity to all children. Most importantly, door-to-door
campaigns and BR camps encouraged economically disadvantaged households to register their children.
Empowerment118 About 2.6 million children were registered through DBR in target districts of Punjab and Sindh (2017-2021)
which has provided them with an identity. The involvement of community members (including religious and
political leaders, teachers, social workers in each province) have created ownership and empowered
communities to continue creating demand for BR services.
Legality119 The Programme aligns with specific child rights provisions enshrined in international treaties and national
laws/strategies (e.g., CRC (1989), The Local Government Ordinance 2001, National Database Registration
Authority Ordinance 2000, National Policy for CRVS Reforms in Pakistan, Punjab Birth Registration Strategy
(2016), Birth Registration Strategy Sindh (2018-2022)).
Integration of DRR in DBR
Desk review and discussions with stakeholders indicate that DBR had no focus on DRR in its design,
implementation and/or results.
Preliminary Conclusions: GE, Equity, HRBA and DRR
GE 1: The Programme is found to be partially compliant to gender equality. The Programme design was not informed by a gender
assessment, nor were any specific interventions designed to reduce gender disparity in registration. Programme implementation is
assessed as partly gender equality-centric whereby door-to-door registration service enabled mothers to access BR services from the
comfort of their home; involvement of LHWs helped in gaining trust and access of mothers to register their children (this is not applicable
for Punjab); community education prioritised both mothers and fathers. In terms of results of registration numbers (2019 and 2020), there
is slight gender disparity between boys (53%) and girls (47%). Although the sex ratio for male is higher in both provinces, lower BR rates
of girls (in both provinces) should have been prioritised. Reporting on gender and age disaggregates for other results was weak/non-
existent.
EQU 1: The DBR design and implementation is assessed as partially compliant to equity principles. Programme design is not informed
by a structured equity assessment and some of the most vulnerable districts (in terms of BR rates) were not prioritized in both provinces.
Implementation offers equity integration in terms of door-to-door service for hard-to-reach areas; outreach through various platforms
(street theatres, BR camps, community meetings, IEC material) implemented to reach vulnerable communities; possible reduction in
indirect costs to travel to UC office for BR. Although the Programme did not report on the equity dimensions, the results from the HHS
indicate inclusion of economically disadvantaged households and children with disabilities.
HRBA and DRR 1: The Programme is assessed as consistent with the HRBA principles of: i) Participation (by involving both service
providers and service users in design and implementation of DBR activities); ii) Non-discrimination and Equality (for providing access to
DBR services to all children without discrimination); iii) Legality (for ensuring consistency with local laws and child rights provisions and
commitments); and iv) Empowerment (2.6 million children were registered and now have a legal identity). The Programme is assessed
as partially compliant with the principle of Accountability due to lack of a feedback/complaint mechanism for beneficiaries. No evidence is
available on the integration of DRR in DBR’s planning, implementation and results.
115 Participation: Everyone is entitled to active participation in decision-making processes which affect the enjoyment of their rights.
116 Accountability: Duty-bearers are held accountable for failing to fulfil their obligations towards rights-holders. There should be effective remedies in place when human rights
breaches occur.
117 Non-discrimination and Equality: All individuals are entitled to their rights without discrimination of any kind. All types of discrimination should be prohibited, prevented and
eliminated.
118 Empowerment: Everyone is entitled to claim and exercise their rights. Individuals and communities need to understand their rights and participate in the development of
policies which affect their lives.
119 Legality: Approaches should be in line with the legal rights set out in domestic and international laws.

Chapter 5: Conclusions, Lessons Learnt and Recommendations
This chapter comprises three sections (i.e., evaluation conclusions, lessons learnt and
recommendations). The first section lists evaluation conclusions drawn from the findings and
preliminary conclusions listed in Chapter 4. The second section outlines the key lessons learnt
(including good practices), framed as such to highlight the potential for replication across sectors and
similar contexts. The last section lists evaluation recommendations to inform scale-up and replication
of the DBR Programme.
5.1 Conclusions
The evaluation conclusions are drawn from the evaluation findings. These highlight the strengths and
limitations of the intervention’s design and implementation. The description offers additional analysis
and insight, intended to help key stakeholders chart out a future course of action. The conclusions are
framed as such to give a perspective on how well the intervention has performed, given the fact that
this is a summative evaluation.
The intervention is indeed relevant for the fact that it touches on the issue of legal identity (birth
registration), which is fundamental and facilitates access to rights and entitlements. Existing gaps in
coverage added further to its relevance. A considered focus on system strengthening that addressed
supply and demand side bottlenecks made the design appropriate. However, there are design elements
that need re-calibration to make the system simpler, accessible and free of cost.
Key design-level improvements include: advocating with relevant authorities to move to a single visit-
single step process (whereby registration and certification are done simultaneously in a single visit and
parents/caregivers are only required to interface with the system once); making registration/certification
free of cost (could start with fee waiver for the first copy of a birth certificate within the prescribed/allowed
period and then gradually push for no/rationalised fee for delayed/late registration); formalization of
interoperability by seeking changes in the Rules of Business of relevant public departments (such as
health, SWD, education and others) including changes in the job descriptions of frontline workers;
making BR database widely accessible (whilst restricting access to confidential information) for both
public sector planners and researchers; expanding collaboration with mobile networks; and periodic
community education and sensitization campaigns.
The intervention has done well in terms of demonstrating different successful models that resulted in
accelerated birth registration. These include: a model of digital birth registration that enabled taking
services to the end users, a model of PPP, and lastly a model of collaboration between public sector
entities (including CSOs). Provincial governments appear willing to continue using these models as
evident in terms of provinces allocating additional funds for replication and scale-up and to take over
the DBR units. This is indeed encouraging and bodes well for the future of digitized birth registration.
Provincial governments would need continuous engagement and technical assistance to upscale, even
if additional public financing is available.
Future assistance must be guided by an expressed impact and sustainability plan, which was not the
case for the period evaluated. The provinces need to be guided to develop a system for birth registration
which is focused on newborns and for that the role of health departments is central. The provincial lead
departments must evolve a system whereby healthcare infrastructure is engaged and provided the tools
to do birth registration at birth and immediately afterwards. The same system could focus on children
ages 1-4, as these children are more likely to interface with the system. For 4-year-olds and above, the
focus must shift to periodic campaign work preferably through the education sector (for both in-school
and out-of-school children) to help address the service gap for unregistered children. Whatever solution
SUMMATIVE EVALUATION OF DIGITAL BIRTH REGISTRATION PROGRAMME 2017-2021
41
is evolved, the system should only require one interaction from parents/caregivers, and the LG and
NADRA systems should interface without requiring another visit from parents/caregivers.
The evaluation recommendations expand further on the conclusions and outline actions that need to
be taken to make the birth registration simple, accessible and affordable.
5.2 Lessons Learnt
This intervention has contributed to valuable learning and good practices, which are outlined below.
These have been drawn from the evaluation findings. Findings have been framed as such to guide the
planners and implementers to either replicate or/and to re-configure in the future. The description
includes the lessons (including good practices), necessary evidence and thoughts around applicability,
and relevance beyond the evaluation object.
3. The shift from centralised to decentralised services is central to uptake of public services
such as birth registration. DBR has proven this as the process of BR was decentralised and the
engagement of facilitators (both from the public sector and others) helped expand outreach and
made services more accessible to users (in contrast to certification which was kept centralised).
For instance, in the selected districts, the number of birth registration points increased from 800 to
11,000 (almost 14 times), which supported registration of over 2.6 million children in five years.
Aided further by digital registration, this approach helped to take services closer to end users. It
also saved time and cost (indirect) for parents and caregivers (at least for registration). This lesson
is applicable in all contexts where registration services (including other public services) are still
centralised and reinforces that the solution lies in decentralisation (and use of digital systems).
4. Shift to innovative use of digital technology is both inevitable and revolutionary, as it can
aid in taking services to the users and cutting time and costs. DBR has demonstrated this by
use of digital tools which have facilitated taking services to end users (at least registration). The
uptick in registration numbers has proven that if people are offered a viable option, they are willing
to register children. This is equally useful for the service providers to enable real-time data tracking
and validation. As the use of digital tools has proven effective in other contexts (e.g., Tanzania and
Nigeria), countries with low BR rates should explore technology options for accelerated rates.
5.3 Recommendations
Recommendations are drawn from evaluation findings and conclusions. The recommendations have
been framed keeping in view the intent and associated actions taken by two provinces to upscale digital
birth registration. Moreover, a considered focus has been placed to incorporate key actors that played
part in programme design and implementation and continue to hold significance for the future (e.g.,
LG&CDD Punjab, LGD Sindh and UNICEF PCO).
The process of framing recommendations started during data collection where stakeholders (such as
UNICEF, public sector partners, donors and communities) were asked to suggest actions and means
to improve the intervention and consequently the results. Recommendations have also benefitted from
the expertise of the evaluation team (who drew on their experience conducting evaluations on BR in
Tanzania and Nigeria). The recommendations have been refined and improved keeping in view
feedback from the ERG members and relevant UNICEF staff.
The description includes broader recommendation/s (explaining what needs to be done) followed by
specific actions (expanding the ‘what’ and ‘how’). For easier use of recommendations and to facilitate
implementation, each action is tagged to one or more relevant actors (as primary and secondary
stakeholders) considered responsible to act. Moreover, each action is prioritized as either immediate,
short term or medium term.120 Where applicable, the recommended actions are referenced to specific
preliminary conclusions.
120 Immediate: 3-6 months and Short-term: 6-12 months.

Table 19: Recommendations
Recommendations Priority Responsibility
Government
Recommendation 1: BR system reforms must continue to enable provinces to make birth registration services simplified, accessible and affordable. The Immediate Primary:
intervention has demonstrated that the solution lies in decentralisation, digitization and demand-creation of services. The intervention has done the much- to short LG&CDD Punjab,
needed foundational work and has generated visible appetite (amongst provinces) to continue. There are still design and operational aspects that merit term LGD Sindh,
improvement to help provinces continue and upscale. The recommended actions for continuity and upscaling include: PDD Punjab and
1.1. The BR Rules (in Punjab) and Bye-laws (in Sindh) may need to be reviewed and revised to include one visit-one step approach (whereby both registration and Sindh, and other
certification is done simultaneously requiring one interaction with parents/caregivers); free of cost registration and certification (at least the first copy of the certificate line departments
may be issued free of cost in the allowed period with rationalised penalties for late/delayed registration); and formalize interoperability by stating the support roles of (health, education,
different public entities for BR such as departments of health, education, social welfare, and others. The current version lacks clarity at present. (REL 2, COH 2] SWD, etc)
1.2. System reforms must prioritise creating a system for registration at birth or immediately after birth. The role of health departments remains central to making such a
system work. The LG&CDD (in Punjab) and LGD (in Sindh) must formalize interoperability by introducing requisite changes in Rules of Business (or mandates of Secondary:
health and other relevant departments) and updating frontline staff of these agencies to contribute as per the prescribed support role. (REL 2, COH 2, SUS 2] UNICEF
1.3. Future reforms must prioritize the issue of non-registered children and evolve campaign-based approaches or modalities. This may be done better if the caseload of
unregistered children is disaggregated into two groups (i.e., ages 1-5 and ages 5-17), and then interventions can be undertaken with health systems to register ages
1-5 (as this group is more likely to interact with health system for immunization and healthcare) and schools reaching unregistered children in schools, including out of
school children (by launching campaigns during summer and session breaks). Such an undertaking would require equipping both agencies (health and education) to
work collaboratively with LG&CDD and LGD and by stating rules of engagement. (REL 2, SUS 2]
1.4. The birth registration system should issue a LG&CDD and LGD-based unique ID to every child (not necessarily the same as the ID given by NADRA) which together
with parent details (including CNIC) should fed into the LG&CDD and LGD database/s. Ideally, the LG and NADRA systems would interrface using parent IDs to update
Form B and other data, without parents have to interact with the system again. The current system does not allow simultaneous registration and certification as there
needs to be verification from the NADRA system and issuance of NADRA-given CRMS (unique ID given to the child and later used for issuance of CNIC). (REL 2,
EFF 2]
1.5. The BR database/s should be functionally linked to other vital events (marriage, divorce, death) and database should be accessible to other public sector planners
(with restricted access to private/confidential information) for planning and resource allocation decisions e.g., schools, immunization, social protection, etc. [REL 2,
COH 2]
1.6. Explore partnerships with private sector and other mobile network companies for technical and financial support and to address issues around internet connectivity
and data backlog, especially in hard-to-reach areas. Seek help from development partners to document (in the form of visibility materials) the Telenor Case Study and
organize events to seek support from the private sector. [EFF 2]
1.7. Seek technical assistance and plan capacity assessment of facilitators and UC staff in target districts. With varied capacities of registration staff, this may require
updating the training materials along with the length of training/refresher events. While LG&CDD have embedded BR as part of routine training exercises for LG staff,
this initiative should be replicated in Sindh as well. [EFF 3, SUS 2]
1.8. Plan and implement periodic communication campaigns and integrate it with other campaigns (such as school enrolment campaigns, breast feeding weeks, mother
and child health week) to enable continuous messaging around the importance and processes of birth registration. [COH 2, SUS 2]
1.9. Seek technical assistance and commission gender equality and equity assessments (at provincial levels) and use findings to inform the design, implementation and
reporting on gender equality and equity parameters such as updating monitoring tools to collect gender and equity specific data and updating communication messages
as per the needs of vulnerable groups and gender. The services at present are not informed by the needs and preferences of these groups. [GE 1, EQU 1]
1.10. Disseminate information on established complaint mechanisms (e.g., toll-free number) so communities can file their concerns and provide feedback on BR services.

Recommendation 2: UNICEF PCO’s technical assistance has demonstrated successful implementation of BR reforms. There is an underlined need for continued Immediate Primary: UNICEF
engagement of development partners (including UNICEF) to scale up at the provincial level. The future assistance of UNICEF should focus on:
2.1. Continue to support provinces with the above-listed actions (where provincial authorities are advised to seek technical assistance from development partners) to enable Secondary: Other
further reform the BR system in order for provinces to have to a functional CRVS. [COH 2, EFF 3, SUS 2]. development
2.2. Future assistance must include province specific target and assistance plans (enabling addressing local challenges). The results framework and TOC should be partners
consistent with Results Based Management principles including intended impact and associated indicators. Moreover, future assistance should be guided by a
documented Exit Plan. [IMP 1]
2.3. Continued advocacy with provincial and national authorities to prioritise functioning CRVS and wider access t CRVS data for possible use for development planning
and resource allocations. Moreover, advocate with Planning and Development (P&D) and Finance Departments for additional financial allocations for LGDs to upscale
DBR. [EFF 4]
2.4. The budgeting should follow activity-based costing (ABC) principles and must be linked to programme results/outcomes. The expenditures statements should be linked
to outcomes/results to enable usable computation and analysis (for internal and external review). [ECY 1]

Appendix 2: Intervention Context
This sub-section begins with a short introduction to the country i.e., Pakistan. This is followed by an
explanation of the challenge/problem of low birth registration and how it is affecting children globally
and regionally. It then zooms into the country-specific situation and circumstances - the legal, policy
and administrative environment including the systemic and demand-side bottlenecks that are hindering
the universal birth registration in Pakistan.
Country Context
The Islamic Republic of Pakistan is situated in South Asia with about 220.8 million (2020)121 population
and an annual growth rate of 2%.122 Of total population, 14.8%123 are children under five years and
nearly 45% are children under 18 years.124 Pakistan, with a total area of 796,096 sq. kilometres,125 is a
federation of four provinces (Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), a federal capital
territory (Islamabad) and two autonomous territories of Gilgit Baltistan and Azad Jammu and
Kashmir.126 More than 60 languages are spoken in Pakistan with Urdu being the national language and
English being the official business language. The current literacy rate in Pakistan is 60%,127 which is
significantly lower than the Asia-Pacific regional average of 89%.128 Pakistan is a federal republic with
a bicameral elected parliament comprising two houses known as the Senate and the National Assembly
and three tiers of government i.e., National, Provincial and Local Government. The Local Government
system is further based on the federated structures of a three-tier system of District (Zila), Tehsil (or
Taluka) and Union Councils (UCs).129
Map of Pakistan
The country has had fluctuating real gross domestic product
(GDP) growth rates, from 9% in 2005 to -0.5% in 2020.130 In 2019,
1.3% of the employed population lived below the purchasing
power parity/day131 whilst 6.9% of the population was unemployed
in 2018-19.132 Weak economic management in Pakistan has
made it difficult to tackle core structural weaknesses of
diminishing fiscal space, declining international competitiveness
and low investment.133 The politico-administrative map of
Pakistan is illustrated in adjacent Figure.134
Global and Regional Birth Registration Context
Birth registration is the permanent and universal recording of a
child’s birth by the Government and a legal proof of his/her existence and identity.135 Birth registration
is not only a fundamental human right, but it also provides the foundation for safeguarding civil, political,
social, economic and cultural rights.
Global: Low birth registration is a global challenge. One in four children under age 5 (estimated 166
million)136 worldwide are not registered. Moreover, even if children are registered, many lack proof with
237 million137 children under age 5 without a birth certificate. The numbers are higher in developing
countries with half of 166 million children residing in five countries; India, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Pakistan
and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.138 The factors behind low birth registration are similar across
the countries that include lack of resources and investment on accurate and comprehensive civil
registration systems; socio-economic and cultural barriers in accessing birth registration; and
policy, regulatory and institutional level obstacles. The last two decades have seen a rise in global
birth registration rate with about 3 in 4 children under the age of 5 registered today compared to 6 out
of 10 back in 2000.139 This could be attributed to the global milestones that have been achieved to
promote universal birth registration (see Box#2). However, despite the recent progress, there are

inequalities (urban vs rural; rich vs poor, girls’ vs boys) which merit additional investments to achieve
Sustainable Development Goal (SDGs) target 16.9140 by 2030.
Regional: South Asia is home to the largest share of children under age 5 without a birth certificate.
The reasons behind can be broadly identified as the fee to acquire a birth certificate; long travel to
birth registration point and judicial costs (incurred to meet legal processes or requirements).
The regional situation in South Asia shows an upward spike in birth registration rate, from around 23%
in 2000 to 70% in 2019.141 Nevertheless, achievement of universal birth registration by 2030 is likely to
fall short for the region. Of all infants (under age 1), slightly more than 1 in 3 have not had their births
registered, and just over half do not possess a birth certificate.142 Similarly, the births of around 1 in 3
children under age 5 have never been recorded (i.e., 103 million).143 The systematic recording of births
in many South Asian countries remains a serious challenge, highlighting the urgent need to improve
and strengthen civil registration and

vital statistics (CRVS).
Low birth registration rates could
potentially affect children in multiple
ways. Absence of birth certificate puts a
child to a disadvantaged position as
indicated in adjacent Figure. A well-
functioning birth registration system
with real-time data generation helps
governments plan and budget
accurately across a wide spectrum of
child-related service delivery, including
health and education that meet the
needs of children as well as parents.
Birth registration becomes an essential
component to protect children’s rights
and for the government’s planning
purposes.
Birth Registration Context in Pakistan
Birth registration in Pakistan is regulated by national and provincial laws and series of international
commitments. Pakistan’s National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) ordinance 2000,
made it obligatory for every new-born child to be registered. In addition, as per the mandate of provincial
Local Government Act, Union Administration is responsible to maintain the birth registration system and
issue birth certificates. Table below lists the relevant national and international human rights
conventions that are ratified or passed by the Government of Pakistan (GoP) related to birth registration.
Some of them were enacted by the federal parliament, whereas others were passed by the provincial
governments.

Convention on the Rights of the Child Article 7: Every child has the right to have their birth legally registered and to have a
(CRC)151 nationality. Every child also has the right to know his or her parents and, as far as
possible, to be cared by them.
Regional Action Framework on Civil By 2024, all people in Asia and the Pacific will benefit from universal and responsive
Registration and Vital Statistics in Asia CRVS systems that facilitate the realization of their rights and support good governance,
and the Pacific (2015 – 2024)152 health and development.
Sustainable Development Goals Target 16.9: By 2030, provide legal identity for all, including birth registration.
(SDGs)153 Target 16.9 and 17.19 Target 17.19: By 2030, build on existing initiatives to develop measurements of progress
on sustainable development that complement gross domestic product, and support
statistical capacity-building in developing countries.
Situation Analysis: Despite the legal landscape aiming for universal birth registration, the national birth
registration rate stands at 42.2% (2017-18).154 Of 166 million unregistered under 5 children in the world,
approximately 9% (i.e., 15.3 million) reside in Pakistan.155 Table shows the national and provincial birth
registration rate of children under five along with gender disaggregates. The birth registration rate varies
significantly from province to province with 75% children under five registered in Punjab compared to
only 19% in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). The gender variance (registered girls versus boys) at the
national and provincial levels is negligible.

Appendix 4: Supply and Demand Side Barriers
Various demand and supply side barriers (See Table below)161 contribute to the low BR rate.
Table: Supply and Demand Side Barriers of Birth Registration in Pakistan
Supply Side Barriers
Parents often face barriers to registration that stem from a lack of financial resources. Birth registration
process is associated with the direct (i.e. birth registration/certification fee) and indirect cost (i.e.
Cost (Direct and Indirect transportation, accommodation, loss of daily wage for taking time off from work etc.). As per survey
Cost) conducted in 2015, registration process includes multiple trips to the nearest UC office, with each trip
costing a household PKR 297162 (USD $3.0) in Sindh and PKR 736163 ($7.40) in Punjab; in remote
areas, this is roughly equivalent to daily wage of a person living at or below the poverty line.
a) Structural problems exist as Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) process is fragmented,
making it difficult to standardise birth registration forms and procedures across provinces, or to
foster coordination among registrar offices and other government ministries.
b) In Pakistan, birth registration is the responsibility of each Union Council (UC), which creates and
maintains civil registration records for residents and report these statistics to the National
Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) for authentication purposes. There is a general
lack of transparency in the registration process, and it is common for UC offices to be constrained
Process Complexity by a lack of resources, low capacity levels among staff, an absence of incentives for facilitating
registration, frequent power cuts, intermittent network connectivity and unreliable technology.
Currently 6,550 UCs exists in Pakistan and only 2,233 UCs can provide birth registration
services164, with varying degree of effectiveness.
c) Further, anecdotal evidence suggests that fees are not always charged as per the stated rates,
or the entire amount collected may not be deposited fully with the exchequer. Bureaucratic hurdles
and lengthy processing-times may also be used as means to obtain bribes from citizens to
expedite the process.
Centralized nature of birth registration process requires citizens to travel to regional UCs to collect birth
Distance/Accessibility certificate. The cost of travelling, when added to the cost of registration and certification, makes the
process of registration a prohibitively expensive venture.
Demand Side Barriers
Lack of awareness and The required documentation for registering births may be unclear to parents, or even differ across
knowledge locations, coupled with limited understanding of the benefits and importance of birth registration.
Furthermore, due to certain social, cultural and economic factors, some groups simply do not perceive
Informal practices which any benefit from the registration of their children at birth. For example, due to the existence of gender
enable discrimination biasness, some parents may not be inclined to register their female children, as they do not anticipate
that their daughters will engage in the future in any form of public life.
Incentivising parents to engage in the birth registration process can be particularly difficult in areas
where an adult’s own experience tells them that, in practice, this is not necessary for accessing basic
Lack of incentive services, especially health care or education. For instance, it has been noted that previously there are
no ‘written rules’ in Pakistan that require evidence of birth registration when enrolling children in school,
accessing health services, registering for Pakistani citizenship, or obtaining a national identity card165.

Appendix 8: HHS Sample, Coverage, HH selection
The details around sampling and contents of the household survey are presented below:
Target Group (Population)
The study population for this survey was comprised of respondents from two provinces i.e., Punjab and
Sindh. The evaluators have further divided the provinces into treatment (intervention areas) and control
(non-intervention areas) groups. The districts in treatment group include Bahawalpur and Pakpattan
from Punjab; Badin and Thatta from Sindh. Whereas the control districts in the provinces are Rahim
Yar Khan and Rajanpur in Punjab; and Mirpur Khas and Sujawal in Sindh. The rationale to select
following control districts is similarity in their socio-economic characteristics as indicated in Table below.
Table: Characteristics of Selected Districts166

Treatment Bahawalpur 120 40% 23% 62% 49% 50.3%

Control 96 30% 35% 16% 57% 46.6%
Khan
Treatment Pakpattan 120 16% 31% 46% 29% 52.7%
Control Rajanpur 96 30% 34% 14% 76% 33.8%
Sindh
Treatment Badin 120 62% 32% 32% 39.1% 33.6%
Control Mirpur Khas 96 42% 38% 29% 36.3% 42.4%
Treatment Thatta 120 73% 26% 50% 52% 27.9%
Control Sujawal 96 83% 24% 36% 66% 25.1%
Sampling Unit
The sampling unit for this survey is a ‘Household’ in targeted UCs from which a parent (mother/father
or primary caregivers) aged 18-65 was be interviewed.
Selection of Survey Respondent
The survey respondent was a parent (father or mother) 18-65 years or primary caregivers who have at
least one child under the age of five. An equal number of 50% male and 50% female respondents were
selected for the study. This was ensured by listing all eligible household members and one respondent
was purposively selected through post stratification technique (alternate selection) - male respondent
followed by selecting a female respondent in the next household or vice versa.
Sample Size
As per proposed sample size in the evaluation proposal, the evaluators carried out the survey exercise
with 864 eligible households as the total sample size in both provinces. Cochran168 statistic is used to
determine master sample for survey. Sample was drawn using probability sampling technique in which
each household in primary sampling unit (union council in this case) has equal chance of selection.
Following parameters are used to draw total sample size for treatment districts.
Confidence Coefficient = 95%
Standard error of estimate = 5% (Standard Error of Estimate)
Event Prevalence Rate (Estimated)= p= 0.5
𝑝(1−𝑝 )
𝐒𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞 𝐒𝐢𝐳𝐞=𝑍∝⁄2
𝑆𝐸
=384
Treatment Group = 384 x 1.25 = 480
Control Group = 384
Total = 864
Since social development statistics in Southern Punjab and Sindh are identical, however, some
variation in each cluster exists. Therefore, to cover maximum variation in selected sample for treatment
group, the sample size is increased by 25%. For selection of sample size in each control district,
following parameters have been used:
166 National Socio-Economic Registry Data 2022
167 https://www.pbs.gov.pk/content/district-wise-results-tables-census-2017
168 Cochran Statistics: Cochrane’s Q test provides a method for testing for differences between three or more matched sets of frequencies or proportions. Cochran’s Q test is the
traditional test for heterogeneity in meta-analyses. Based on a chi-square distribution, it generates a probability that, when large, indicates larger variation across studies rather
than within subjects within a study. The underlying null hypothesis assumes that the true treatment effect is the same across studies and variations are simply caused by chance.

These parameters generate sample size of 96. Therefore, minimum sample size for each control district remains 96 but for
treatment districts it has increased to 120 household each.
These parameters generate sample size of 96. Therefore, minimum sample size for each control district
remains 96 but for treatment districts it has increased to 120 household each. The resulted sample size
(864 HHs)169 is considered appropriate to study and compare the desired aspects (KAP of communities)
of old vs digital birth registration system/services at community level. The proposed sample size
complies with most research study standards of using 95% confidence level, with an accuracy of ± 5%,
which is generally recommended for most research studies and is considered a statistically valid sample
size.
Sample Allocation and Selection
The sampling strategy evolved with changes in the proposed evaluation design. In lieu of the above,
the coverage of HHS is reduced to 8 districts (4 treatment districts in Sindh and Punjab), 4 control (non-
intervention districts in Sindh and Punjab).
1. At the first stage of sampling, each province i.e., Punjab and Sindh are divided into treatment
(where the UNICEF has implemented the Programme) and control (district with no exposure to
Programme activities) groups. The rationale behind selecting these treatment districts is that these
districts were part of both phase I and II of the Programme and enables evaluators to capture
transition and changes (if any) made in strategies and approaches during its duration. Another
criterion is to select treatment districts that have employed two or more than two birth registration
models i.e., digital, hybrid and manual models.
2. For the second stage of sampling, the evaluators purposively selected the treatment districts from
first and second phase of the Programme. Additionally, the evaluators purposively selected non-
exposed districts as control group that are closest and similar in socio-economic characteristics to
the treatment groups.
3. At third stage for the sample allocation, the total sample size of 864 households was allocated
between treatment and control groups i.e., 384 HHs (96 HHs per district) from control districts in
Punjab and Sindh; and 480 HHs (120 HHs per district) from treatment districts of both provinces.
4. Fourth and the second last stage involved simple random selection of primary sampling unit, in this
case, it is the union council/town committee/municipal committee from each survey district. For
sample allocation to primary sampling unit, Lot Quality Assurance method170 was used as
reference point. Minimum of 12 sample was selected from each PSU. Table 11 shows the number
of households and UCs that were selected from each control and treatment districts in both
provinces. To select desired number of UCs for each district, computer assisted random sample
technique was adopted. The table below was used as reference point for LQAS.
169 The sample size has been increased from 800 to 864 from the technical proposal to cater to the design effect.
170 Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) methodology provides real-time planning and management information. It uses small sample sizes to classify administrative
geographical areas, to inform if these areas have achieved or not a pre-determined target for a given indicator (https://www.elrha.org/project/lot-quality-assurance-sampling-lqas-
survey-techniques/)

Appendix 9: Household Survey Tool
Introduction and Consent:
Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening. My name is __________________________ and I am working with
Analytics Lab, Pakistan. We are conducting a household survey for the evaluation of UNICEF’s Pakistan
Digital Birth Registration Programme in Sindh and Punjab. I would like to talk to you and learn about
the knowledge, attitude, perception, and practices of your community about birth registration. We would
also like to hear from you about the government and UNICEF joint programme on improving birth
registration services in your district.
You have been chosen randomly to take part in this survey. Your help in answering the survey questions
is purely voluntary and important to inform such programmes in future. The questions, I will ask, are
about the birth registration services in your district. There is no monetary or material but social benefit
of your participation in this survey, and the accumulative responses received from your community will
be used to help UNICEF and the Government of Pakistan understand the situation better and improve
related services for your communities.
There are no right or wrong answers to these questions. If I ask you any questions you don’t want to
answer, please let me know, and I will skip to the next question. You can refuse to answer any specific
question and/or end the interview whenever you want. Your responses will be kept confidential and not
be shared with anyone with your name or personal details.
Do you have any questions about the survey currently?
1. Yes (answer the respondent queries and continue the interview)
2. No
Should we start the interview?
1. Yes
2. No (move to next household. Note down and communicate the total refusals to your
supervisor on daily basis)
SECTION 1: HOUSEHOLD IDENTIFICATION
This is the administrative data for household identification. This table below should be filled by the
enumerator before starting the interview (not to be asked to the respondent).

4. ‘Household’ means “persons living together and eating from the same kitchen or combined
kitchen. In other words, household is where members pool money and spend together”
SECTION 2: RESPONDENT SCREENING
For this ‘Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices” (KAP) survey we are interested to interview a parent
(father or mother) and/or caregiver aged 18-65 who have at least one child of age less than 5 years.
Note:
• The rationale for selecting 18 to 65 age bracket is to include respondents of different age
groups. Whereas the upper limit of 65 means there are chances that a respondent recall
capacity may have been compromised beyond 65.
• Moreover, this age bracket (18-65) will ensure the respondent has the physical condition to
complete the 50-60 minutes interview process.
• The district supervisor will be responsible to ensure that an equal sample (50% fathers and
50% mothers) is selected for this survey.
• The condition of having at least one child under 5 is to ensure that the household has the
opportunity of registering their child’s birth (whether they did or not). Moreover, it also refers to
the same 5-year period that falls within the project.
• If the parents of the child are deceased or do not live in the same household then the child
primary caretakers take the responsibility of raising the child. A person can be identified as the
primary caretaker of a child only if he/she lives in the same household with the child. These
persons are identified to ensure that in the absence of parents, birth registration information is
collected on the child. They are not, however, persons who take care of the child when the
parents are away. For instance, a person caring for the child during daytime when the parents
are away at work is NOT a primary caretaker.
Please use following questions to screen the respondent.

Focus Group Discussion - Parents, Marginalized/vulnerable group, Community leaders/elders
Introduction and Consent:
Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening! My name is __________________________ and I work with
Analytics Lab, Pakistan. These are my colleagues __________ (moderator to introduce the supervisor
and note taker and their role in the FGD). We are conducting a focus group discussion for the evaluation
of UNICEF’s Pakistan Digital Birth Registration Programme. The programme was implemented to
digitize and improve the birth registration services in 9 targeted districts of Punjab and Sindh and to
educate communities about birth registration to encourage them to register children.
Your participation as parents, marginalized/vulnerable group or community leaders/elders is essential
to understand how the services and knowledge of BR has improved. We will ask few questions to seek
your views, experiences, and suggestions. We would appreciate your active participation and honest
feedback to pass on to UNICEF, Telenor and LGDs, to help them plan better for the future. These views
and suggestions will be kept confidential and would only be used for the evaluation of DBR.
Please bear in mind that there are no right or wrong answers but differing points of views. So, express
yourself freely during the discussion. Everyone will get a chance to speak, so please listen patiently to
one another. Your participation for this group discussion is voluntary. If we ask you any questions you
don’t want to answer, let us know and we will go on to the next question. You can also stop the
discussion at any time. We hope that you will participate in this process, as your inputs and suggestions
can help LGDs improve their services.
This conversation will be recorded on tape, so that we do not miss any of your comments and use it for
transcription. This group discussion will take 60-90 minutes to complete.
Do you have any questions about the evaluation or the group discussion currently?
May we begin the group discussion now?

Appendix 16: Quality Assurance Measures Implemented
General Quality Control During Fieldwork
The following key measures were implemented to ensure the quality assurance of all the processes
during field data collection; In addition to these measures, the evaluators implemented various safety
and protective protocols (See next section) to ensure that all research participants/respondents and
evaluators themselves are not exposed to any possible risk under COVID-19 pandemic.
• Continued support and supervision: The consultants (both international and national) with
support from the local partner provided support and supervision in the field whenever
necessary.
• Experienced staff was engaged for field data collection.
• Comprehensive training of all the field staff was ensured. The core team trained the
master trainers at regional level, which in turn trained the other staff
• Gender balanced staff was deployed
• Informed Consent from each respondent was taken by explaining the purpose of their
activity and its relevance to them.
• Collection of Field Evidence of the events was done with prior approval from the
concerned respondents/participants of the KIIs and FGDs.
• Confidentiality and anonymity of the participants was maintained, and findings were
summarized to an appropriate level of aggregation without revealing the identity of
respondents.
Quality Assurance of Household Survey Processes
The quality assurance of the household survey was achieved through the following steps:
• A senior National team staff member accompany randomly selected field teams during the
initial days of data collection to observe, double-check work, and provide on-site feedback
to enumerators;
• All questionnaires were tracked and accounted for by assigning identification numbers;
• Interview log sheets (record completed questionnaires and rescheduled appointments)
submitted by enumerators daily and verified by supervisors;
• Supervisors assess/check the completed questionnaires at the end of each day; and
where required supervisors have a coaching session with each enumerator to highlight
any inconsistencies or inaccuracies in the completed interviews
• Any errors, lessons, and corrective measures discussed by each field team daily during
evening meetings and shared with other teams through supervisors;
• All team members remained in contact to ensure a shared understanding of approaches,
data collection processes, challenges, and mitigation measures;
• Data entry was done automatically with the use of CAPI devices for survey administration.
The CAPI based interview inherits several ‘in-built’ quality checks around ‘skip patterns’ in
the questionnaire logic
Independent (Survey) Quality Monitoring:
In addition to the quality control measures mentioned above, the Evaluators identified and deployed a
team of independent field monitors who carried out the following activities:
• Spot-checking: The team performed a spot-checking exercise on 5% of the total sampled
respondents.
• Field Protocols Monitoring: Through its local partner, the Evaluation Team observed all
enumeration teams to check whether the asking of questions, recording of responses and
treatment of respondents is compliant with the standards.
• Accompanying Interview: The field monitors observed fieldwork protocols to ensure that
respondents are selected appropriately, and that the replacement procedure is carried out
according to standards/guidelines. At least 10% of total interviews were observed and
supervised for on-spot counselling to the enumerators to ensure quality data collection.

• In Phase I, the programme achieved 73% of its set target i.e., 700,000 birth registered by 2018
and in phase II, the programme has overachieved its target of registering 2.6 million births by
2021.177
• The total allocated budget as per the expense sheets (USD 1.4 million) was fully utilized over
the period of five years. Actual timeline of the programme was from 2017-2020 and programme
sought one year no cost extension as huge backlog was present during the second half of year

All below findings are drawn from review of progress reports. These highlight various aspects of the
Programme efficiency.
Delays in Payments; In Phase I, Lengthy and cumbersome process of facilitators incentive transfer is
a major challenge in timely funds transfer which demotivated some facilitators. Issues in payment
modalities have also been addressed through formation of a finance core team that has offered
mitigation measures to ensure timely payments in the future.179 However, In Phase II, the issue of

payments was mitigated through simplifying the process through the involvement of the third-party
vendor for the payment of the incentive. Gradually the incentive was withdrawn, and the tasks were
performed by the facilitators voluntarily.
Low internet connectivity and weak signals: It is evident from Phase I Progress report that there
were thousands of forms that were offline when the internet connectivity was not there, in some cases
the forms were also lost during upload and transfer thus really affecting the morale of the facilitators.
With the forms not getting uploaded due to no internet connectivity, users were frustrated when they
were taking submissions and not getting the desired quantifiable results in the system. To mitigate the
issues of connectivity and signals, facilitators were provided Wi-Fi dongles from other service providers
to ensure that signals are available for the collection and input of birth registration data. At the DBR
cells and sub-offices, servers were backed up or the offices were supplied back-up power and internet
lines. Paper-based data collection, as part of the Hybrid Model, was initiated in 2018 to capture data
that was missed due to signal or connectivity issues.
Power shortages also resulted in non-functionality, where union council secretaries required
access to the NADRA system for the generation of a CRMS code. During phase I, in Sindh, 47 UCs in

in 13 Thatta still do not have computers. The government has been informed about this gap and efforts
are being made at both ends. UNICEF is following up to facilitate dialogue and reminders to ensure
implementation.
Adequacy of human resources
• Low existing technological capacities of birth registration facilitators. To address this
issue, teams at the federal, provincial, district and tehsil levels have been fully recruited and
trained to support union council secretaries and facilitators in the use of the application and
smartphone devices. 180
• In Phase II, at the early stages, including data security issues, data center administration issues
at DBR cells, delayed handover of the new Android application Package (APK) and dashboard
by Telenor and limited IT skills of government IT managers and field staff. A DBR technical
forum was established with technical and programmatic experts as members to mitigate the
issues being faced with the system. Additionally, a three-pronged strategy laying out a hybrid
model was introduced for filling registration application forms. 181
• In Phase II, the DBR programme had to bear high transition costs associated with frequent
government staff turnover. Close and ongoing engagement with department officers, including
permanent staff, helped mitigate this challenge. 182
• Gaps in community level infrastructure resulted in poor coordination between field offices
however joint field monitoring was carried out to monitor work efficiency of field offices.
• The governments themselves have limited digital infrastructure and serious capacity
constraints, such as inadequate hardware and software capabilities, lack of adequately
qualified and competent IT resources to safeguard and administer citizen data, particularly at
the union council level. 183
• Varying professional capabilities of facilitators also played a key role in their performance. It
was observed that greater number of children were registered by lady health workers in
comparison to nikkah khwans, who tended to not have the technical capacity to use
smartphones. 184
Adequacy of Time
• Frequent changes in the Local Government legislation in Punjab has been major challenge as
many activities could not be executed within set timelines.
• In Thatta and Badin, the creation of town committees and municipal committees was another
challenge. In Thatta, four UCs were merged with town committees or other union councils.
Meanwhile, two new town committees and two municipal committees were formed. These
modifications are not updated in the DBR system and nor did the new structures have requisite

Innovation and efficiency:
Community The implementation strategies in DBR include community engagement using innovation social behaviour
Engagement change strategies. Advocacy and Communication is also an important strategy used to advance the call
for free and universal birth registration achieved and embedded within CRVS for Punjab and Sindh
provinces.
Use of C4D cell of SWD The Social Welfare Department’s direct engagement was beneficial in terms of leveraging of the available
for social mobilization resources for social mobilization for birth registration. The Social Welfare Department in Punjab extended
the functions of the C4D Cell to devise strategy on demand generation. Birth registration campaign is the
permanent feature of advocacy for birth registration/CRVS. Community meetings, birth registration camps,
street theatre and other demand generation activities were organized to reach vulnerable communities in
targeted districts.
Use of community-based Recognizing the importance of making the birth registration processes less costly and more accessible, the
‘gatekeepers’ new approach, developed in partnership with UNICEF, Telenor and the Local Government Departments of
the Provincial Governments of Punjab and Sindh, introduced the use of community-based ‘gatekeepers’ to
act as either mobile or stationary birth reporting facilitators.
1. Nikah (marriage) registrars were chosen as mobile gatekeepers in Punjab, primarily due to
their existing status as government-authorized marriage contractors. As part of their regular
duties, Nikah registrars’ complete forms, collect and deposit fees, and regularly visit UC Offices
to register marriage records. Lady Health Workers, who provide maternal and child health
advisory services, especially in rural areas, were chosen as mobile gatekeepers in, Sindh.
2. Telenor agents, or ‘Sahoolat Ghars’, were introduced in both provinces as stationary
gatekeepers. Sahoolat Ghars were chosen because they were already proficient with relevant
administrative procedures, such as issuing mobile phone SIM cards, handling cash
transactions and verifying NADRA’s National Identity Card information.

Appendix 24: Coherence Findings
International Guide
Evaluation Findings
/ standards
UN Principles and The DBR Programme is partially coherent with The UN Principles and Recommendations on Vital Statistics,
Recommendations because currently the focus is only on registration of births. The other recommended vital events (deaths, foetal
on Vital Statistics deaths, marriages, divorces, annulments, separation (judicial), adoption, legitimation, recognition185) are not
covered by the DBR Programme.
Sustainable The DBR Programme is coherent with GoP policy priority under SDGs 16.9 which specifies ‘By 2030, provide
Development Goals legal identity for all, including birth registration Indicator 16.9.1: Proportion of children under 5 years of age
(SDGs) whose births have been registered with a civil authority, by age’. Also, the SDGs 17.18 and 17.19 (80% deaths
registration), and SDG 10.2 are linked with a well-functioning CRVS system. The DBR Programme, if scaled-
up across the Country has the potential to enable the GoP in achieving the mentioned SDGs186.
UNICEF, and The DBR Programme is consistent with guidelines and recommendations, made by a group of BR experts from
UNESCAP 07 regional countries and representatives of UNICEF, UNSD, UNHCR, the World Bank and United Nations
guidelines Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP)187. These guidelines emphasize on
national coordination, collaboration, and integration of civil registration and identification.
Coherence with The DBR Programmes is coherent with Government’s efforts to comply with its various international
GoP’s International commitments (UNCRC 1990 Article 7; and 2001 UN General Assembly Resolution ‘A World Fit for
Commitments Children,’ Article. 44/1)188. The DBR Programme supports the GoP in developing a system to ensure that
every child should be registered at or shortly after birth and ‘every child has the right to a legally registered
name, and nationality which is officially recognized by the government.
Coherence with The DBR Programme is coherent with GoP’s regional commitment made under ‘The Asian and Pacific CRVS
Regional Action Decade (2015-2024) and the Regional Action Framework’189. With that, the GoP aims to achieve universal
Framework and responsive CRVS system by 2024. The DBR Programme contributes to all 07 priority actions190, specifically
in improving policy and legislation, providing infrastructural support and capacity building, and enhancing
effectiveness and efficiency of operational procedures by brining innovation in BR with technology use.
