IV. Executive summary
This is the final evaluation of the joint $2.6 million project “Communities Resilient to Violent
Ideologies,” PBF/KGZ-A-72, which was funded by the UN Peacebuilding Fund (PBF) and
implemented by UNICEF, UNFPA, and UN Women. The project was a multi-agency effort to
increase community resilience to violent and manipulative ideologies, including those exploiting
faith, through the means of education, empowerment and dialogue. It focused on 12 municipalities
in the north and south of Kyrgyzstan. The project aimed at empowering youth to take critical
stances toward extreme ideas. It also supported horizontal and vertical trust with institutions,
communities, and families. The project strategy included three separate but interconnected
outputs. The first output was youth, adolescents and women in target communities gaining civic
competencies in schools, homes and the community. The second output was young people and
adults in target communities collaborating to address local vulnerabilities that lead to violent
extremism. The third output was strengthening the capacity of opinion leaders, civil society
activists and religious leaders to build meaningful dialogue and exchange resulting in positive
messaging. The project began in January 2018, was extended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and
ended in July 2021.
The purpose of this evaluation was to fulfil UNICEF, UNFPA and UN Women’s accountability
with the national government, PBF and other stakeholders by providing an assessment of the
results of the project. It also addresses the circumstances influencing the project’s achievements.
This allows the evaluation of evidence of achievements, lessons learned and recommendations for
strategic directions.
The intended users of the evaluation include decision-makers from the government, implementing
partners and the implementing UN agencies (UNICEF, UNFPA, UN Women), the UN
Peacebuilding Fund, local self-government staff in project communities, and project beneficiaries
in the 12 target municipalities.
This evaluation covers the entire period of the project implementation, from 11 January, 2018 to
10 July, 2021. The evaluation was conducted from June 2021 to January 2022.
The methodological approach of this evaluation aligns with the evaluation criteria of the OECD
DAC Criteria for Evaluating Development Assistance. This includes assessing relevance,
effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability, impact, and the newly agreed criteria on coherence. It also
evaluates cross-cutting themes such as gender and equity, as per the Terms of Reference. After
reviewing the conflict analysis and reconstructing the Theory of Change (TOC), the evaluation
team used a mixed-method approach of data collection. This includes a desk review and literature
review, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and an online guided survey. Analysis
of TOC and contribution analysis, content and qualitative analysis, and quantitative analysis were
employed to answer the questions developed against the evaluation criteria. In addition, the
evaluation built on the good practices from the literature on peacebuilding and peacebuilding
evaluation.
Key Findings and Conclusions
Relevance: The evaluation found that the PBF-funded project was relevant as the project design
was anchored on a sound understanding of the context of Kyrgyzstan and the root causes of
2 The project's Gateway page http://mptf.undp.org/factsheet/project/00108337
8
violent extremism. The project’s assumption that youth and women have a potential as
peacebuilders was validated by the project. However, the lack of agreement on the clear definition
on violent extremism and radicalization caused some uncertainty among project participants,
especially at the beginning of the project implementation.
The project strategy was adequate for addressing the root causes of violent extremism that the
project had identified. The project strategy included using education, empowerment, and dialogue
to address the drivers of violent extremism and to build resilience to violent and manipulative
ideologies. The project is innovative, as it was the first in the country to use such an approach to
counter VE. However, the TOC could have been improved by more thoroughly articulating
assumptions at the project development stage.
The project was based on research on the needs of young women, and men, particularly in
vulnerable groups. It was designed to engage young people seen as marginalized, vulnerable, or
‘hard to reach’. The project objectives aligned with both national strategies and UN key strategies
for Kyrgyzstan.
Coherence: The project was designed and implemented building on the comparative advantage
of each UN agency. Several factors facilitated cooperation between the agencies and with the CSP
implementing partners, such as 1) the willingness of the agencies to cooperate with each other; 2)
the clear vision for what the project intended to achieve; 3) the clarity of comparative advantages
of each agency. However, the evaluation found some minor obstacles to developing a more
effective joint program, such as 1) not clearly defining the roles and responsibilities of each agency;
2) not mapping complementary projects at the beginning of its implementation; and 3) not clearly
documenting interaction with complementary projects during implementation.
Effectiveness/Impact: The evaluation found that, within its sphere of influence, the project
successfully empowered youth, women, and other beneficiaries. The project increased young
people’s confidence and self-esteem, and it helped them to develop critical thinking,
communication, teamwork, and leadership skills. The project empowered beneficiaries such as
community leaders, local authorities, and adults to engage with youth and to deliver positive
messages to counter violent extremism.
The evaluation also found some evidence that its integrated approach, targeting the individual,
institutions, and families and communities, had a positive impact on youth resilience to violence.
This was confirmed through triangulation of data and by a guided questionnaire specifically
devised to measure youth’s resilience to violence. The results of the survey, developed by the
project, suggested that participation in project activities fostered a sense of belonging to community, and
increased confidence in the state among young people. It also influenced their violence related behaviors
and beliefs by leading them to be more open to communication and dialogue as a way to resolve
conflicts. The underpinning assumption of the project was validated by this evaluation:
empowering youth and other main beneficiaries, strengthening their trust in government and
developing a sense of belonging in the community/family can have a positive impact on their
resilience to violence. However, it is too early to verify all results of the project, especially at the
community level.
Efficiency: Project activities were implemented in a timely and resource appropriate manner,
resulting in overall project efficiency. The project responded smoothly and quickly to the
challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, adjusting some of its activities so that the pandemic
became an opportunity for stronger impact. For instance, quickly moving its training programs
online resulted in reaching a wider audience. There was a demonstrated commitment to follow
project plan and measure its results, but the monitoring and evaluation system suffered from some
9
weaknesses. These included 1) the complexity of the concept of VE and how to measure them; 2)
the absence of a strategic peacebuilding framework at the portfolio/country level that would
facilitate the measurement higher-level results of impact; and 3) the absence of the project baseline
or an end-line data for measuring its indicators.
The focus on good reporting and knowledge management could be improved by allowing the
project team to clearly document the progress of the project, its challenges, and all the solutions
that were tested to address those challenges.
Sustainability: The evaluation identified signs of sustainability for some of the project activities
and results. For instance, the project supported the development of child and youth friendly plans
that now ensure that the needs of the young people and women are integrated with the socio-
economic development plans of the pilot communities. Other results of the project have already
been institutionalized, such as the gender and anti-discrimination educational materials that have
been adopted by the MoES.
The evaluation also highlighted that for community resilience to withstand violent extremist
ideologies, follow-up activities will need to be developed by the government, with the support of
International Organizations and CSOs.
Gender Equality: The project also showed the importance of gender mainstreaming throughout
activities related to all three outcomes. Most gender equality commitments in the initial project
documents were realized during the implementation of the project. The project contributed to the
commitments of the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) Agenda and UNSCR 1325 by
implementing initiatives for young women in local communities, such as training and mentoring
workshops and events, and promoting women’s initiatives and collaboration with local level
institutions on addressing women’s rights and gender equality.
The evaluation concludes that the project was highly relevant for the country and its intended
beneficiaries. It had an integrated approach to resilience to violence that proved efficient and
effective even when implemented under challenging circumstances including the COVID-19
pandemic. While some of the results of the project need follow-up to be sustained over time, there
is solid evidence of a positive impact on youth empowerment and on strengthening youth
resilience to violence.
The evaluation result in a series of recommendations:
• The PBF should continue supporting youth empowerment projects shown to be effective
around VE. It should also formalize the development of a long-term strategic framework
to represent the foundation of the youth empowerment projects;
• The PBF should build on the existing platforms it has already developed to strengthen
knowledge management and facilitate the exchange of information among countries that
receive peacebuilding funds;
• The PBF secretariat should consider helping country follow PBF guidance and possibly
strengthen the capacity of country teams to develop peacebuilding projects;
• The UNRC office should continue providing guidance on addressing complex concepts
such as VE;
• The RUNOs should continue focusing on youth empowerment and peacebuilding around
VE through an integrated approach, including peacebuilding into their regular programs
and investing in skill development for peacebuilding;
10
• RUNOs should strengthen MEL systems so that learning can become one of the priorities
when developing and implementing peacebuilding projects;
• When conducting joint projects, RUNOs should clarify the level of collaboration they seek
by clarifying roles and responsibilities;
• When developing peacebuilding projects, RUNOs should develop solid partnerships with
complementary projects by identifying them at the conception stage, building on the
common synergies, interact with them during implementation, and document those
interaction in progress reports;
• The government should build on the results of the project to ensure sustainability.
Lessons Learned
This evaluation offers a series of lessons learned, including…
1. spending enough time to develop a solid and coherent project;
2. developing a well-articulated TOC at design stage;
3. learning being integrated with the core of peacebuilding projects so that teams can
continuously see the progress of the activities;
4. defining operational terms of VE concepts at the design stage;
5. envisioning longer term projects or develop a strategic framework that could fund shorter
projects with realistic indicators that complement each other over a period of five years or
more;
6. developing a sustainability strategy from the very beginning of their design.

V. Introduction
The project “Communities Resilient to Violent Ideologies” (hereafter “the project”) was
implemented as a joint initiative by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United
Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and United Nations Women (UN Women) from 11 January
2018 and 10 July 2021. The total budget of the project was 2,601,082 USD, which was provided
by the United Nations Peacebuilding Fund (PBF). The project’s geographical scope is focused on
12 municipalities spread across 2 cities, Bishkek and Osh, and Kyrgyzstan’s 6 provinces: Batken,
Jalal-Abad, Issyk-Kul, Naryn, Osh, and Talas.
The objective of this evaluation report is to share the findings, conclusions and recommendations
based on the Theory of Change (ToC)-based evaluation of the project. The evaluation was both
summative, presenting how ToC was implemented through the reference period, and formative,
demonstrating the dynamics influencing the results and contributing to long term impact, and
follow-up. The report unpacks the lessons learned and recommendations for implementation for
United Nations agencies, civil society implementing partners, the PBF, and national duty bearers.
The evaluation was commissioned by UNICEF Kyrgyzstan, supervised by the UNICEF
Kyrgyzstan Child Rights Monitoring Specialist, Tolgonai Berdikeyeva, and entrusted to the
following evaluation team:
• Mr. Tommaso Balbo Di Vinadio, International Consultant, Team Leader
• Ms. Gulnara Asilbekova, National Consultant 1
• Ms. Kanykei Latipova, National Consultant 2
The evaluation process was accompanied by reviews and comments from UNICEF Child Rights
Monitoring Specialist and the UNICEF Europe and Central Asia Regional Office Evaluation
Specialist, colleagues from an Evaluation Reference Group (ERG), Evaluation Management team
(EMT), PBF and UNICEF external quality assurance team. (Annex 5: Terms of Reference of the
Evaluation Reference Group)
The evaluation process was composed of three phases:
Phase 1. Inception: review of documentation, elaboration of the methodology, identification of
stakeholders, consultation with the Reference Group, development of the Inception
Report.
Phase 2. Data collection and field work: conducting remote data collection (as per standard
COVID-19 prevention measures. with 90 interviews), two focus groups, an additional
desk-review, and the consultation with the Evaluation Reference Group regarding the
preliminary findings.
Phase 3. Data analysis and reporting: conducting the analysis of interview and focus group
notes, analysis of project documentation, report drafting, remote consultation with
Reference Group and UNICEF Kyrgyzstan, and finalization of the Evaluation Report.

Context and Conflict Analysis
The Kyrgyz Republic is in Central Asia and shares borders with Kazakhstan to the north,
Uzbekistan to the west, Tajikistan to the southwest, and the People’s Republic of China to the
east. The population of the country, as of July 2021, was 6.6 million, with about 34 per cent living
in urban areas and 66 percent in rural areas. Over 50 percent of the population of the country is
under the age of 29, and almost a third of the population is between 20 and 39 years old. The
ethnic makeup of Kyrgyzstan is diverse, including Kyrgyz (74 percent), Uzbek (15 percent), and
Russian (5 percent). An estimated 3 percent of the population is made up of other minorities,
including Dungan, Uighur, and Tajik, each
representing one percent of the population. The
rest are represented by Turks, Kazakhs, Tatars,
Azerbaijanis, Koreans, Ukrainians, Germans,
Turkmens, Chechens, Belarusians, and others.
Women constitute 50.4 percent and men 49.6
percent. Approximately 75 percent of the
population is Muslim (the majority Sunni), around
20 percent are Russian Orthodox, and the rest 5
percent constitutes minority religious groups.3
The country comprises seven provinces (oblasts)
- Batken, Jalal-Abad, Issyk-Kul, Naryn, Osh,
Talas, and Chui; nine administrative divisions; and
two administratively independent cities: Bishkek,
the Capital, and Osh. In 2020, 1,678,000 people,
approximately 25% of the population of
Kyrgyzstan, lived below the poverty line. 73.7 Figure 1. Map of Kyrgyzstan, showing provinces,
percent of these were residents of rural administrative centers, and neighboring countries
settlements.4 (Research Gate)
Poverty continues to be widespread. At the end of 2020, the poverty rate had increased
by 11 percent, reaching 31 percent of the population.5 In 2021, the poverty level in Kyrgyzstan
may grow by another 4 percent, reaching 35 percent of the population.6
Since it gained its independence in 1991 when the Soviet Union collapsed, Kyrgyzstan has been
considered one of the most democratic states in Central Asia due to commitment to democratic
values, support of human rights and freedom of independent media. However, over the last 25
years, the country has faced endogenous and exogenous obstacles accompanied by revolutions7,8
internal protests and confrontation due to superficial observance of the democratic principles.
Several instances of cross-border and ethnic violence have occurred over the past decades. For
example, this mix of tensions contributed to a surge of violence in June 2010 in the southern cities
of Osh and Jalalabad and their surrounding areas.9 In 2021, tension escalated with the neighboring

country Tajikistan.10 The main reasons for conflicts with the neighboring countries, such as
Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, are “border demarcation, and access and use of natural resources as
water for irrigation purposes and pasture grounds for grazing animals.” 11
The issue of radicalization and violent extremism entered the discourse in Kyrgyzstan after the
2010 violence in the south of the country was coupled with unsolved economic and social
problems. Disaffected youth and women, especially among ethnic minorities, have become more
prone to embracing violent and radical ideologies because of real or perceived discrimination and
exclusion. This most commonly appears in barriers to education and employment. In addition,
formal politics limit youth participation.12
By 2021, more than 800 citizens of Kyrgyzstan, including about 150 women, travelled to Syria and
Iraq to join extremist groups.13 Young people have been active in more informal groups and
movements. Young people show a high degree of trust in religious organizations, higher than in
the state and international organizations (see Figure 2). This is due to reasons such as lack of ability
to participate in decision-making, little trust in state institutions, and struggle to find jobs, internal
and external migration, and barriers to obtaining quality education. Widespread access to the
Internet through mobile phones is perceived as the main channel for radicalization. Recent
research14 shows that young people in the southern provinces have higher vulnerability than their
peers in the north. Batken oblast and Osh city are the most vulnerable locations due to complex
interethnic relations and a history of confrontations. The study also found that young people who
are involved in labor migration, and those whose parents are absent due to labor migration, are
more vulnerable to radicalization.15
Figure 2. Degree of youth’s trust in various organizations according to questionnaire results conducted by
Nasritdinov, et. al. (2019)
Women, along with youth, have been a major target of PVE measures. According to the project
document, “women and girls who joined violent groups show that women’s specific vulnerability
to joining violent groups is linked to a process of re-traditionalization where women return to
traditional values, family life, religion.”16 Women and girls are pressured to drop out of school at
early ages, which leads to poor literacy. They are encouraged or forced to stay at home looking
after elderly family members. Having no education or gainful employment makes women
financially dependent and vulnerable. Law enforcement and security officials report that17 almost
all women who followed their husbands to Syria were not aware of the armed conflict taking place
there. They simply followed their husbands as obedient wives. Kyrgyzstan has been investing in
achieving gender equality and respect for women’s rights with a strong legislative base that is
aligned with international policies and standards. However, the practice of gender inequality

continues to be pervasive in the country. Major concerns remain, including gender-based violence,
exclusion from decision-making, domestic violence, bride-kidnapping, trafficking, child marriage,
and physical and psychological abuse.18 In addition, although there is a gender parity in education
enrolment and literacy rates in Kyrgyzstan, women’s economic involvement (48.2 percent, versus
men’s at 75.7 percent), and political empowerment (with only 17 percent19 of seats in the
Parliament in 2020 held by women20) remains low.
Violent extremism is still considered a recent phenomenon in the country. Nevertheless, over 30
projects in the field of prevention of violent extremism (PVE) have been implemented in
Kyrgyzstan with the support of international organizations and agencies in the last four years.
These involve over 42 million USD.21 In 2015, the International Crisis Group estimated that
around 3000 Central Asian citizens had joined radical groups fighting in Syria and Iraq. The
majority were young men between the ages of 25 and 35, with women accounting for up to 25%
of the total.22
Legislation and National Policies on Youth and Prevention of Radicalization in Kyrgyzstan
Kyrgyzstan’s strategic benchmarks for its long-term development as a politically stable,
economically strong, and socially responsible state are defined in the National Development
Strategy of the Kyrgyz Republic 2018-2040 (hereafter, the National Strategy) approved by the
Decree of the President of the Kyrgyz Republic, dated October 31, 2018 No. 221. This was
endorsed in November 2018. 23 The National Strategy established that Kyrgyzstan would strive to
achieve the Sustainable Development Goals adopted by Resolution 70/1 of the United Nations
General Assembly Nations September 25, 2015. The National Strategy outlines the country’s
overall commitment to sustainable growth through development of four areas: 1) Individual –
Family – Society, 2) Economic well-being, and quality of environment for development, 3) Public
administration, and 4) Development management. The National Development Program 2018-
2022 “Unity, Trust, Creation”24 serves as a medium-term implementation plan for the National
Strategy. The National Development Program aims to improve the quality of citizens’ life through
sustainable economic growth. The program lists liberal fiscal policy, development of the regions,
and investment protection mechanisms as priorities. 25

Within the project “Communities resilient to violent ideologies,” the Decree28 of the Temporary
Regulation on the procedure for holding the competition "City friendly to children and youth" was
approved. The Regulation is based on the Concept of regional policy of the Kyrgyz Republic for
the period 2018-202229
The Kyrgyz government adopted and launched its National Program on Countering Extremism
and Terrorism for 2017-2022 in 2017.30 The Action Plan names three priorities: 1) Preventing
extremism and terrorism, 2) Detecting and combatting extremism and terrorism, and 3) Improving
legislative procedures and collaboration in the fight against extremism and terrorism. As a
complement to that, the UN developed the 2017-2020 Peacebuilding Priority Plan (PPP) in
Kyrgyzstan in collaboration with the Kyrgyz government in 2017.
To ensure the implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325, the Kyrgyz
Government adopted an action plan for 2018-2020 (dated September 21, 2018, No. 334-p) with
the following goals:
1. Strengthened role and participation of women in activity aimed at preserving peace and
security, including at the decision-making level;
2. Strengthened interaction of state agencies, LSGs and the civil society for the prevention
of conflicts and risks of violence towards women and girls;
3. Improvement of the system of protection and meeting special needs of women and girls
in emergencies.
The Peacebuilding Priority Plan (PPP) 2017-2020 identified key drivers of violent extremism
including growing inequalities, perceptions of injustice, human rights violations, socio-political
exclusion, widespread corruption, marginalization, and isolation of certain populations.31 The

revised PPP defined three interlinked outcomes as building blocks of interventions for preventing
violent extremism in Kyrgyzstan, each of which is implemented by a UN agency:
Outcome 1: Justice and security sector institutions, national and local authorities apply
socially inclusive approaches participatory decision-making, and guarantee increased civic
space (UNDP, UNICEF, OHCHR, UN Women).
Outcome 2. Penitentiary and probation officers, as well as the police and forensic experts,
are able to prevent and address radicalization to violence by ensuring adequate safeguards
respecting national and international standards (UNODC, UNDP).
Outcome 3: Women and men, boys and girls in target communities take a more critical
stance on ideologies instigating violence, and have a better sense of belonging to their
communities, and participate in local development and dialogues over PVE (UNICEF,
UNFPA, UN Women).
The project “Communities resilient to violent ideologies” contributed to PPP Outcome 3 on
diverting people at risk from a radicalization path by means of community dialogue, education,
and development.
Brief project description
The project “Communities Resilient to Violent Ideologies,” funded by the UN Secretary-General’s
Peacebuilding Fund ($2,601,082), was approved as a joint initiative implemented by UNICEF,
UNFPA, and UN Women for an initial period of 36 months32, from 11 January 2018 to 10 July
2021. The project’s geographical scope of activities focused on the 6 provinces (Batken, Jalal-Abad,
Issyk-Kul, Naryn, Osh and Talas) and 2 cities (Bishkek and Osh) covering 12 target municipalities:
1) Bishkek city (Bakai-Ata, Ak-Ordo); 2) Osh city (Sulaiman-Too, Kerme-Too, Amir-Temur); 3)
Alliya Anarov municipality in Aravan district; 4) Karasuu municipality in Karasuu district; 5)
Nookat city; 6) Gulistan municipality in Nookat district; 7) Jalalabad city, 8) Suzak municipality in
Suzak district; 9) Kyzyl-Kiya city in Kadamjai district; 10) Sary-Bulak municipality in Tyup district;
11) Ugut municipality in Ak-Talaa district; and 12) Kara-Buura municipality in Kara-Buura district.
According to the project document, the project’s main objective was “to build community
resilience to violent and manipulative ideologies, including those exploiting faith, through the
means of education, empowerment and dialogue.”
The project interventions had four focus points, 1) providing young women and men with critical
skills, 2) engaging them in civic life, 3) strengthening capacity among local self-governments and
adults33 who had a potential role in countering youth violent extremism through daily interactions,
and 4) ensuring social inclusive and gender sensitive programming at local level.
Gender equality was also an important objective of the project. For example, one of the main
focuses of project activities designing age-appropriate and gender-sensitive materials for teaching
non-violent culture and civic competencies among youth, adolescents, and women. The project
32 The project’s original duration was 36 months; However, in 2020 due to delays caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the project was extended till
10 July 2021. The project received additional 7 months. Hence, an overall of 43 months.

aimed at mainstreaming gender in all three outputs, with women included in the planning and/or
implementation of all project activities.
The project thematic scope related to SDG 4 (Education), SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong
Institutions), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) and to SDG 5 (Gender Equality) as a cross-cutting
issue.
The table below gives a brief overview of the project and its main activities

Stakeholder analysis
The project under review had 3 implementing agencies, with UNICEF as the Leading agency, that
conducted the activities of the project together with some implementing partners. Some ministries
of the government of Kyrgyzstan were engaged in the project form the beginning at national and
local levels. The three implementing agencies, together with Government and civil society officials,
19
were part of the Joint Steering Committee, which met regularly. The project beneficiaries were
young women and men, and their parents, teachers, community members in the targeted
municipalities.
UN Agencies: The project was funded by the Peacebuilding Fund and implemented by three
Recipient UN Organizations (RUNOs) in Kyrgyzstan: UNICEF, as the leading agency, together
with UN Women and UNFPA. UNICEF Kyrgyzstan was the leading agency for the coordination
of the project, the organization of the joint planning of the project, and joint monitoring and
reporting. The project closely coordinated with several dialogue building and peacebuilding
projects funded by EU, the US Government, and the UK, as well as those implemented within
PBF’s Gender and Youth Promotion Initiative (GYPI). RUNOs took part in PPP outcome
meetings organized by the PBF Secretariat to improve coordination with other PBF-funded
projects and ensure information exchange.
Joint Steering Committee: The Joint Steering Committee (JSC) which was established in 2013 to
coordinate the project, oversee implementation, participate in the monitoring of the peacebuilding
projects, and provide recommendations to improve the project strategies. The JSC was a multi-
stakeholder body established on the order of the Kyrgyz Republic’s President. The JSC was
composed of 28 individuals representing Government, civil society, and development partners. It
is co-chaired by the Head of the Department for Interethnic Relations and Collaboration with the
Civil Society of the President of the Kyrgyz Republic and the UN Resident Coordinator. The JSC
met regularly as the agencies presented and discussed the outcomes of the interventions. The JSC
was also a relevant platform for development actors to coordinate their interventions. As a part of
their monitoring and oversight, they also undertook field trips to project sites to provide feedback
and contribute to sustainability of the results and local ownership35. The composition of the JSC
was updated and regular meetings were organized with the launch of three PVE projects in
Kyrgyzstan within the framework of the Peacebuilding Priority Plan from January 2018.
National level: The main project partners were the Ministry of Education and Science and its
structural subdivisions, State Commission on Religious Affairs of the Kyrgyz Republic, State
Agency on Youth, Physical Culture and Sports under the Ministry of Culture, Information, Sports,
and Youth Policy of the Kyrgyz Republic. These were involved in the project from the beginning
and participated in working groups. Ministry of Interior Affairs (MIA), the Office for Combating
Extremism and Illegal Migration, State Agency for Regional Development under the Ministry of
Agriculture, Water Resources and Regional Development, State Agency for Local Self-
Government and Interethnic Relations, State Agency of Local Self-Government and Interethnic
Relations were involved actively in the project.
Municipal level: The project took place in six provinces of the Kyrgyz Republic across 12
locations36: Issyk-Kul, Naryn, Talas, Osh, Jalal-Abad, Batken provinces; Bishkek and Osh cities.
The target municipalities were selected through a separate assessment and identification of pilot
communities in consultation with various stakeholders. These target municipalities were selected
out of 60. Government and civil society stakeholders identified as prone to violent extremism and
meeting criteria related to geographical coverage, population size, ethnicity, avoiding overlap with
other projects and willingness of communities to collaborate.

3,545 young people demonstrate improved skills in research and analysis. For Output 2, at least
2,560 young people were involved in community consultations and advocacy. For Output 3, 296
women and girls participated. The project also benefitted parents, teachers, community members
in the municipalities targeted by the project, and ultimately all community members of twelve
municipalities. Other activities that were conducted by the final beneficiaries at local level involved
many other people.
VI. Purpose, Objectives and Scope of the Evaluation
Evaluation purpose
This evaluation has produced evidence on the main evaluation questions, and it has drawn lessons
learnt and recommendations. The evaluation covers the entire period of the project
implementation (11.01.2018 – 10.07.2021) and was conducted from June 2021 to January 2022.
The evaluation was done in accordance with the OECD DAC Criteria for Evaluating
Development Assistance, including relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability,
and impact.
The purpose of this evaluation was to:
 Fulfil UNICEF, UNFPA and UN Women’s accountability towards national
government and PBF and other stakeholders by providing an assessment of the
results of the project;
 Assess the circumstances influencing the project’s achievements and the challenges
that hindered it;
 Generate knowledge and evidence on achievements, lessons learned and
recommendations to influence further strategic directions.
The primary intended users of the evaluation are:
• decision-makers from government;
• implementing partners and the implementing agencies (UNICEF, UNFPA, UN Women);
• the UN Peacebuilding Fund.
The secondary intended users are:
• local self-government staff in project communities;
• project beneficiaries in the 12 target municipalities.
Annex 6 summarizes the specific possible advantages that those stakeholders will have building
on the results of this evaluation.
21
Evaluation objectives
The objectives of the evaluation were the ones identified in the TORs, as follows:
· to validate the Theory of Change;
· to determine the relevance of the project to the context, its effectiveness;
coherence, efficiency in reaching results;
· to provide evidence on the achieved results;
· to assess project’s potential to be sustainable and make impact;
· to identify lessons learned and recommendations;
· to identify the extent to which cross-cutting strategies such as human rights-based;
approach, results-based management and gender, equity have contributed and have
been mainstreamed in the project implementation.
Scope of the evaluation
Concerning its programmatic scope, this evaluation provides an independent assessment of the
project “Communities resilient to violent ideologies”, which covers all project activities during the
period from January 11, 2018, to July 10, 2021. It does not cover activities under PPP outcomes
one and two.37 The evaluation covers the full geographical reach of the project and will conduct a
more in-depth evaluation in 638 out of 12 target municipalities39 where the project was
implemented. More information on sampling is provided in the methodology section.
Finally, the evaluation analyzed the effects of the project on the beneficiaries (youth, parents,
teachers, women and girls, and community members) as well as on the duty bearers (officials from
local and central government).
This evaluation differentiates stakeholders and targeted beneficiaries.
- Stakeholders: police, parents, teachers, local authorities, religious leaders, and Civil Society
Organizations (CSOs) and groups for disadvantaged women, media, and academic
institutions for teachers’ advanced education;
- Targeted beneficiaries: as the project was a youth empowerment project the final
beneficiaries were meant to be youth. The report indicates youth, young men and women,
when referring to final beneficiaries.
VII. Theory of Change
This final project evaluation undertook a Theory of Change-based approach, by reviewing the
existing TOC and reconstructing it to determine whether:
● the envisaged changes identified at project design stage have taken place;

● the possible contribution of the project to bring about those changes can be
confirmed;
● the assumptions that the project identified were realized.
The evaluation included a contribution analysis, based on the TOC, of the 3 elements mentioned
in Box 140.
The TOC included in the project document is the following: ‘If women and men, boys and girls in the
communities have critical thinking skills AND are able to positively claim and exercise their rights through civic
engagement, THEN they will become resilient to violent and manipulative ideologies, BECAUSE they will have
a sense of belonging to their communities and confidence in the State’.
The evaluation team reconstructed the TOC to better articulate the different pathways for change
as well as the assumptions underpinning those pathways. The TOC was visualized (see Figure 3
below41) and validated through two workshops with key project stakeholders42 (RUNO current
and former staff involved in project development and implementation).
40 The TOC also served as the basis for the evaluation team to develop the main evaluation questions that will be addressed through a series of data
collection and analysis tools (further described in the inception report).
41 The TOC also shows the evaluation questions (EQ) per criteria that are later described in this document
42 Those stakeholders were as follows: project implementers from UN Women, UNFPA, and UNICEF, including Program Officers, M&E
Specialists, Program Analyst.
It is important to note that the TOC may be slightly revised during the data collection and analysis phase. The revised version will be integrated
into the final report.

The TOC of the project was the following:
● Problem analysis: The project identified some key drivers of violent extremism that were
assumed to be connected to each other, such as low confidence in the state and the
dissatisfaction in state services, weak critical thinking skills and educational deficiencies, lack
of opportunities for youth and vulnerable women to voice their concerns, and the lack of job
opportunities. The project also identified specific categories (minorities and women from
religious communities) that are at higher risk of recruitment to conflict zones (Syria) because
of problems of marginalization from society.
● Inputs: Based on this analysis, the project adopted an educational approach based on improving
civic education, civic engagement, and community dialogue through needs assessment,
developing educational materials, capacity building exercises, etc.
Related assumptions of the project were that:
● Youth, including women, can potentially be instrumental in peacebuilding as they want
peace and can have a positive impact.
● The approach envisaged by the project (educational approach + civic engagement +
community dialogue) can effectively address the drivers of extremism.
● Joint programming is an effective way to implement such a program through
coordination among themselves and with other partners and through effective use of
resources.
● Short and medium results (outputs and outcomes): If those assumptions are met, the project expected
the activities implemented by the project to bring about changes in attitudes of individual
beneficiaries (youth, teachers, parents, women and girls, religious leaders, community leaders,
local self-government, and CSOs, etc.), strengthening skills such as critical thinking of youth,
and building their confidence as individuals. The expectation was that those results would also
be visible at the community level as groups/communities would change their behavior and
challenge social norms that formed barriers.
At the same time, the project expected the government at national and local levels to integrate
youth, including women’s and girls', needs44 and concerns into their development plans and
strategies. It expected the Ministry of Education and Science to change the curriculum to
integrate project approach to reduce violent extremism. The project aimed to have an impact
also at the socio-political level.
Specific assumptions of the project were that:
○ Police, teachers, parents, government officials, community leaders and religious
leaders can have a role to play in countering violent extremism;
○ Youth, women and girls have the capacity to influence other youth and members of
the community;
○ Government is willing to collaborate and engage.
● Long-term results (impact): The final expectation of the project was that it would strengthen young
women, including vulnerable women, and men and in community resilience by diverting
44 The expectation would be also that the needs of women and girls needs would be integrated so that local authorities would consider the gender-
sensitive and socially inclusive aspects in local development plans (plany socialno-ekonomicheskogo razvitiya)
25
people at risk from a radicalization path by reducing key driving factors of conflict. The project
would contribute to the purpose of peacebuilding in Kyrgyzstan.
The specific underpinning assumptions of the project at this stage were that:
○ These results would be achieved as young women, including vulnerable women, and
men would increase both their sense of belonging with their community and their
confidence in the state.
○ In more general terms, the project assumed that there would be a strong
interconnection between peacebuilding and young women, including vulnerable
women, and men’s empowerment.
Overall, the long-term results of the project, resilience to violence were expected to be met by
strengthening the individual (empowerment and civic education), the institutional (civic
engagement) and the family/community (community dialogue). This is more fully articulated
in the relevance and effectiveness section of this report.
VIII. Description of Methodology
This was a summative, utilization-focused and equity-oriented evaluation using a theory-based design.
Overall, this evaluation used a mixed-method approach.45 It followed the UNEG norms and
standards. This section describes in depth the methodology used by the evaluation team for sampling,
data collection, and analysis.
Evaluation criteria and questions
This evaluation was done in accordance with the OECD DAC Criteria for Evaluating Development
Assistance, namely relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability and impact and the newly agreed
criteria on coherence46. The evaluation includes an evaluation matrix (see annex 2) that unpacks the
main questions and relates them to the approaches and sources of information to be used in answering
them.
Relevance: The evaluation assessed the extent to which the project objectives address the real
problems (the root cause of violent extremism) and the needs of its target groups (women and men,
with a particular focus also on vulnerable groups). It also examined whether this was based on good
practices and the literature on peacebuilding and violent extremism. The evaluation also assessed
whether the approach of the project was appropriate to address the identified problems country
priorities, associated policies and donor priorities.
Evaluation question 1: How relevant was the project in addressing the main drivers of violent
extremism, the real needs of its beneficiaries as well as the national and donor priorities in Kyrgyzstan
45 The evaluation will use a non-experimental evaluation design and a theory-based approach. ‘Today, the most commonly used method in
development evaluation is a mixed method results‐based approach, using both qualitative and quantitative information. ‘OECD guidance note on evaluating
peacebuilding’
46 For a list of the OECD DAC criteria see: www.oecd.org/dac/evaluationnetwork
26
Coherence: The evaluation assessed, firstly, the internal coherence: the extent to which the UN
agencies and implementing partners collaborated effectively based on their comparative advantage
and clear division of tasks (assessment of the joint approach). Secondly, the evaluation assessed the
external coherence: the extent to which the project was able to develop synergies and linkages with
complementarity projects funded by other donors at project conception and during implementation.
The evaluation wanted also to verify whether those synergies benefited the project or not.
Evaluation question 2: To what extent was the project internally coherent and to what extent was it
designed and developed in synergy with other stakeholders’ interventions on peacebuilding?
Effectiveness/Impact47: The evaluation assessed the extent to which the objectives of the
intervention have been achieved or are expected to be achieved, and whether the intervention has
contributed to addressing the drivers of violent extremism by changing attitudes, behavior, social
norms, and affecting changes at the institutional level. This criterion is strictly linked to the criterion
of relevance, as the evaluation wanted to verify whether the approach chosen by the project was
appropriate to address the root cause of the violent extremism in the country.
Finally, the evaluation wanted to verify whether there have been any unintended positive or negative
results.
Evaluation question 3: To what extent did the project achieve its objectives?
Efficiency: The evaluation assessed the extent to which the project delivered results in an economic
and timely way. This included an assessment of whether funds and activities related to project were
delivered in a timely and resource appropriate manner, especially in the context of COVID-19. The
evaluation also assessed the governance of the project, especially the role and the guidance from the
Steering Committee. Finally, the evaluation verified that the monitoring mechanisms used by the
project were effective in measuring and informing management of the project performance and
progress towards the targets
Evaluation question 4: How efficient was the project in using its resources to achieve its objectives?
Sustainability: The evaluation assessed the extent to which the results of the intervention continued
or were likely to continue, as well as the financial and contextual catalytic effects. In particular, the
evaluation assessed whether the project generated national ownership and capacity to continue
implementation of the results achieved.
47 The evaluation decided to merge the criterion of effectiveness and the one on impact for the following reasons: the project terminated its activities
only recently, and it is unlikely to actually have solid evidence/data for impact; building trust and resilience is a long term endeavor and it is quite
difficult to appreciate the results just after the project has terminated its activities; Also, the ‘likelihood of impact’ in terms of willingness of the
government to continue engaging with youth, the appreciation of the sense of community building and trust in the institutions will be evaluated under
the criterion of sustainability
27
Evaluation question 5: To what extent are initiatives supported by the project likely to be sustained over
time so as contribute to peacebuilding?
The evaluation also looked at two cross-cutting themes48: gender and equity/human rights/leave-no-
one-behind. The evaluation assessed the extent to which the project mainstreamed gender in all its
activities, whether women and girls benefited equally from all 3 outputs, and whether the conflict
analysis was gender-sensitive and socially inclusive.
Methods for data collection, analysis, and sampling
Sampling
To address the evaluation questions while maintaining representativeness of the findings, the project
evaluation team sampled six out of 12 project municipalities49, in line with what was envisaged in the
TORs.
A specific set of criteria50 was developed to sample these municipalities:
· Balancing geographical coverage of the project: Based on the project documents, the target
municipalities were selected using the following ratio: 60% in the southern part and 40% in
the northern part of the country. The same approach was applied to the selection of the sample
municipalities, resulting in 2 communities in the north and 4 communities in the south.
· Representativeness of the type of settlements: Sampling balanced urban, rural and mixed areas
and size of population in the north and in the south. The sample included one city and one
urban area in the north, and two urban (bigger city and mixed area) and two rural areas in the
south.
· The level of coverage by the project services/activities, CSOs, and international stakeholders.
· The presence of ethnic minority groups: The evaluation included areas where the
representation of minority groups is profound. Muti-ethic project areas (5 of the 6 sampled)
were covered by the project final evaluation as seen in Table 2.
The table below shows the municipalities that were sampled by the evaluation team in agreement with
the ERG.
48 The questions for those themes are already integrated into the evaluation matrix.
49 The project targeted twelve municipalities covering all seven provinces of the country, which government and civil society stakeholders have detected
as prone to violent extremism: four municipalities from the northern part of the country and eight municipalities from the southern part.
50 The EMT approved the sampled municipalities through a participatory workshop held during the inception phase.

Data collection and analysis
Data for this evaluation was gathered through a mix of qualitative and quantitative tools, which
complement each other for the sake of triangulation to increase the credibility of the findings.
1. Desk review (EQ from 1 to 5): The team first undertook a desk review with the main purpose
of providing an overview of:
○ the project design and relevance towards national plans and strategies and youth needs
○ cooperation between UN agencies and with external stakeholders at design and
implementation stage
○ the realization of the project’s results pathways and assumptions, and indications of
result sustainability
○ the budget and financial data of the project.
The main documents that were reviewed were as follows:
○ project-related documents (i.e., project document, quarterly and annual progress
reports, internal documents of UNICEF, UNFPA, UN Women)
○ general strategic documents of the Government of Kyrgyzstan (i.e., national strategies)
as well as Strategic documents of the Provinces selected for the evaluation. Also, plans
of sampled municipalities, municipal budgets, decisions, that can bring evidence to
youth-led initiatives in the sampled case study municipalities
○ conflict-related analyses conducted for the country
○ financial and budget related documents
○ any other relevant material produced by the project (web/social media sources, video
material)
○ presentations and minutes of the Steering Committee.
2. Focus group discussions (FGDs) (EQ 1 and 3): the team conducted 2 FGDs with the EMT and
the main NGOs involved in the project. The main objective was to…
○ Better identify the main topics/elements to be better investigated with the other tools
deployed, such as interviews and guided questionnaires
○ Address some of the EQs, especially those related to relevance and effectiveness (EQ
1 and 3)
○ Validate final evaluation recommendations.
The team conducted two more FGDs with the EMT to discuss the main recommendations
to ensure that recommendations were as feasible and operational as possible
FGDs collected information from the key project stakeholders to determine the focus issues
for the evaluation. These were further examined through in-depth interviews with a variety of
stakeholders and beneficiaries.
3. Semi-structured interviews with stakeholders and beneficiaries51 (EQ from 1 to 5): the team then
undertook of 90 interviews with selected project stakeholders (see Annex 7) to gather
51 The team will then discuss with the final project beneficiaries the project results and their perception of the possible changes they have experienced.
The reason for the team to conduct those interviews after the FGDs is to examine at a deeper level some of the issues that will possibly emerge from
the group discussions with project stakeholders.

additional information from people who had been involved in the design or the
implementation of the project. This allowed verification of the information gathered during
the desk review.
See Annex 7 for a complete list of the stakeholders interviewed.
The evaluation selected stakeholders (national and local government) and beneficiaries to be
interviewed through ‘purposeful sampling’. The interviews were conducted in Russian,
Kyrgyz, or Uzbek, depending on the beneficiary origin. In compliance with the COVID-19
protocols, interviews were conducted by phone.
The evaluation included an interview guide for each group of stakeholders (see Annex 8),
which served as a basis for conducting the interviews. Measures were taken to ensure
confidentiality and preserve anonymity, and the interviewees were informed and asked for
consent. Some interviews were held with minors (see Ethics section of this inception report
and Annex 11 for the consent form), as youth project participants were aged 13-28.
4. Guided questionnaire (EQ 3 is covered): The team developed and managed a guided phone
questionnaire with 43 youth52. The first purpose of the guided questionnaire was to gather data
to overcome the challenge of the project not having a baseline assessment. Also, the
questionnaire allowed the evaluation to measure long-term results of the project (resilience to
violence). The questionnaire also improved validation of findings, as results were triangulated
with data from interviews, desk review and FGDs.
The guided questionnaire was built on the BRAVE-14 tool that defined some key factors and
14 measurable items underpinning youth resilience to violent extremism, as follows: 1) cultural
identity and connectedness, which includes cultural knowledge, cultural continuity, cultural
security, and cultural adaptability; 2) relationships and networks, including bonding capital,
bridging capital, linking capital; 3) community norms, behaviours, attitudes, and values,
including coping with adversity, problem behaviours, and resources for problem solving; and
4) framing, preventing, and responding to violence, including beliefs, values, and
resources/strategies for non-violent conflict resolution.53 To contextualize this tool and align
it with the approach used by the project, the evaluation slightly revised the original BRAVE-
14 and developed a specific questionnaire comprised of 3 main elements: 1) sense of
belonging to community; 2) confidence in the state and 3) violence related behavior and beliefs
(see the results in Annex 12). In each area, a set of three questions were defined to measure
the outcome. The respondents were asked to express their agreement or disagreement with
the items using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5)54.
It is important to note that the evaluators made a connection with the project activities by
asking for each questions the following statement, “As a result of the project activity you have
participated in...” For the sake of efficiency, the evaluation team reached out to those 43 young
people through phone calls and then guided them through though the questionnaire,
explaining the questions, and filled in the online questionnaire on their behalf.
52 The evaluation team relied on UN implementing agency to facilitate the random selection of the participants. With this cohort the team conducted
the questionnaire at the very beginning of the call so as to have a similar approach with the other 30 young people with whom the team were not
conducting interviews.
53 For more information, please refer to Michele Grossman et al. “Understanding Youth Resilience to Violent Extremism: A Standardized Research
Measure Final Research Report”, 2017
54 43 young people from six target municipalities were reached out through the questionnaire: 30.2% male and 69.8% female; aged from 14 to 25.
31
Concerning data analysis, the evaluation used the following tools:
• Analysis of TOC and contribution analysis: Based on the reconstructed TOC, the evaluation
used a contribution analysis to identify pathways for change and underpinning assumptions. In
particular, the contribution analysis:
o identified the expected changes that the project wanted to have (TOC)
o gathered existing evidence to test the theory of change
o determined whether the changes the project has brought about can be considered as a
contribution from the project activities by developing a contribution narrative55
• Content analysis and qualitative analysis: The evaluation team collected qualitative
information from both the review of the documentation related56 to the project and the interviews
and FGDs responses. It stored the data in a shared folder. Finally, it reviewed and coded
information by developing categories and subcategories.
• Quantitative analysis: quantitative analysis57 was conducted to…
o use the results of the guided questionnaire to validate and triangulate findings of the
level of knowledge or motivation increased because of the project activities
o analyze data extracted from the documentation on the results of the project and from
some of the interviews.
• Triangulation and complementarity: Quantitative and qualitative analysis were combined to
triangulate findings and to identify emerging themes and patterns. The sequence of data collection
methods ensured triangulation and complementarity of data:
1. document review and focus groups identified the most important issues
2. those issues were then investigated more in depth and the findings confirmed or not
through interviews
3. the guided questionnaire was used to further triangulate the findings and quantify
qualitative results.
Ethical Issues and limitations to the evaluation
Ethical issues
The project evaluation team gave a special attention to ethical practices during the process of the
project evaluation. The project evaluation team ensured inclusiveness, respect for diversity, and open
expression of opinions of the evaluation participants while protecting their safety and the
confidentiality of their feedback.
The approach adhered to the norms and standards for evaluation, and the ethical guidelines of the
UN system and UNICEF.58 The evaluation team observed:
55 In case, the evaluation team brought additional evidence to then revise or strengthen the contribution narrative
56 Excel tables were used to summarize the main notes/extracts from interviews and FGDs
57 Given the limited amount of quantitative data, no particular method was used by the evaluation team (coding or cleaning the data).

The evaluation team implemented an evaluation approach that met the ethical evaluation obligations
and principles, as further described.
The obligations of the evaluators to participants included:
Respect for dignity and The national evaluation team members who were locally recruited to carry out the field
diversity work were fully aware of local culture, local customs, religious practices, ethnicity, as
regards the gender roles and the evolving role of the youth, and of other traits, to ensure
respect during data collection. The national project evaluation team members provided
notices to individuals and partner non-government/government institutions involved in
data collection in advance to secure the conditions to respect people’s right to privacy
and keep disruption to a minimum. This preparation enabled the team to check the
representativeness of interviewees, the inclusion of ethnic groups to the maximum
extent, gender balance, as well as inclusion of more vulnerable stakeholders. The
structure of the project lends itself well to an inclusive, diverse outreach to stakeholders.
Rights a. Right to Self-Determination: Participants of the evaluation were treated as
autonomous agents. They involved data collection based on their voluntary participation
and the ability to opt out of the process at any time. The evaluation participants were
informed fully about 1) the aims of the evaluation and the background/composition of
the evaluation team, 2) why they were invited to participate in the evaluation, and 3)
what the benefits of the evaluation would be.
b. Fair Representation: Participants were selected fairly in relation to the aims of the
evaluation, covering all project sites and all project stakeholder groups.
c. Compliance with codes for vulnerable groups: The evaluation team observed the
international and national norms of governing the interviewing of children and young
people. The human rights background of the Team Leader, and a human rights-based
evaluation approach which envisages the various stakeholders as rights holders and/or
duty bearers (as duty bearers are also citizens with their rights), and which entrenches
issues related to access to rights at the very heart of the evaluation matrix, helped secure
respect for the rights of the stakeholders throughout the evaluation process and the
integration of human rights considerations in the data collection and analysis. Finally,
the conflict analysis and peacebuilding lens, which serve as benchmarks to evaluate the
relevance of the project both contain important human rights elements: this aspect
added to the human rights orientation of the evaluation, both for data collection and for
analysis.
33
Confidentiality The evaluation participants were assured of confidentiality and anonymity. The
evaluation team members respected people’s right to confidentiality. They were clearly
informed of the confidentiality measures: their contributions were aggregated and
anonymized in the report, and their responses will be kept confidential. The final report
does not reference any names. While the final evaluation report may include quotes
which are representative of widespread opinions expressed by the interviewees, they
were screened by the evaluation team members to ensure that they are not attributable.
Evaluation participants were informed of this process. It is a common practice that
during interviews and focus groups, the evaluation participants will be asked permission
to take notes from interviews and discussions. Evaluation consultants explained that
detailed notes taking assures data accuracy. All interview notes will be kept within the
evaluation team and not forwarded to any other actor, including UN agencies. Notes
will be stored in a password-protected drive during the evaluation and completely
deleted upon completion of the evaluation. No sensitive personal information was
expected from the interviews. Data that was stored on devices other than the team drive
(USB memory sticks, for example) will be deleted after the end of the evaluation.
No harm Following the “do no harm principle”, and the principle of benevolence not
malevolence, the evaluation team minimized risks to and burdens on people
participating in the evaluation. The evaluation sought to maximize the benefits and
reduce any unnecessary harms that might occur from negative or critical evaluation,
without compromising the integrity of the evaluation. A no-harm data collection process
includes clear information about the data sought to be given in advance to the evaluation
participants. Online meetings and Key Informant Interview were planned according to
participant availability. The duration of the meetings and interviews were kept within
generally acceptable time-limits, and participants were asked how much time they would
be comfortable dedicating to the interviews.
The research needed for this evaluation included interviews with children and
adolescents. Children involved in the evaluation were 14 to 18 years old. The elements
of the UNICEF Procedure for Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation, Data
Collection and Analysis (2015) were observed: Respect, Informed consent, Privacy and
confidentiality, Harms and benefits, Justice, Payment and Compensation. A special
procedure was applied to obtain informed consent from children and their parents. As
this evaluation was conducted entirely online and the UN implementing agencies and
partner CSOs supported the evaluation team logistically to arrange online meetings. The
project team was asked to inform the parents regarding the evaluation and obtain signed
consent forms prior to interviews. The children were informed about their right to
choose the level of involvement in the process of evaluation. The evaluation ensured
the data confidentiality at all levels.
The inception report, with evaluation methodology, interview templates, and consent forms were
submitted to the ERB in parallel for the quality assurance procedure. Ethical approval was given, after
which the data collection phase started.

IX. Data Analysis - Findings
This section is organized around a chapter for each evaluation criteria: relevance, coherence,
effectiveness/impact, efficiency, and sustainability.
Relevance
1.Main questions: How relevant was the project in addressing the main drivers of violent extremism, the real needs of
its beneficiaries as well as the national and donor priorities in Kyrgyzstan?
Sub questions:
1.1 To what extent was the design of the project appropriate for achieving the desired objectives?
1.2 To what extent was the project based on a sound understanding of the different needs of young women and men?
1.3 To what extent is the project consistent with key national development strategies, including in peace and
development?
This section addresses the main question and sub-questions related to the relevance criterion: how the
project design was based on an appropriate understanding of the country and of the root causes of
violent extremism (despite the initial difficulty to define this concept) around youth. Finding 1 focuses
on the lack of critical thinking/educational deficiencies, distrust of the government, and perception
of ethnic divisions. Finding 2 examines the extent to which this framework allowed the project to
develop a 3-fold approach around civic empowerment, civic engagement and community dialogue.
Finding 3 examines how the project developed a strong rationale for its design, while not clearly
articulate a TOC. Finding 4 examines whether the project was based on a good understanding of youth
and engaged with them from the beginning of its conception. Finding 5 explores the extent to which
the project aligned with the main UN and government strategic documents.
Finding 1. The design of the project was anchored on a solid understanding of the context of
Kyrgyzstan and (some of) the root causes of violent extremism. However, the project did not
initially put forward a definition of violent extremism.
36
Triangulation of information/sources
Desk review of project documentation (project document, United Nations Peacebuilding Priority
Plans for Kyrgyzstan, research papers on violent extremism)
Interviews with UN agencies,
FGDs with UN agencies
The logic behind the conception of the project is considered appropriate as it is well articulated, and
it built upon the main findings of the growing literature on violent extremism, peacebuilding, young
women, including vulnerable women, and men.
The main underpinning assumption that the project made was that youth and vulnerable women in
Kyrgyzstan are susceptible to recruitment by conflict actors59 mainly because of their sense of
exclusion from public life, dissatisfaction towards the state (related to the lack of employment
opportunities), lack of critical thinking and educational deficiencies, and perceptions of ethnic
divisions.
The evaluation found that the project accurately identified those problems as some of the root causes
of violent extremism for youth, which constituted the ‘structural foundations’ of the reconstructed
TOC60.
The project targeted youth and vulnerable women as its main audience, recognizing that adolescents
and young people can be considered as perpetuators of violence mobilized for violence and can often
be instrumentalized by conflict actors61. This assumption was validated by the project during field
consultations conducted at conception stage. For instance, statistics gathered by the Ministry of
Interior Affairs showed that a high number of 20–22-year-old from Kyrgyzstan reported to have
travelled to combat zones in the Middle East62. This position was also confirmed by evidence of young
people being particularly susceptible to recruitment63.
The project found evidence for another assumption identified in the TOC of the project: youth
(including women) can also have a potential as peacebuilders as they can be active agents for peace. This
position was recognized in 2015 with the unanimous adoption of UN Security Council Resolution
2250 on Youth, Peace and Security (UNSCR 2250) and in other research and reporting on the
subject.64
59 This is confirmed from the analysis of the project documentation (i.e. UNPBF PPP 2017-2020) as well as from the interviews with the stakeholders
and FDGs
60 Structural foundations means that the whole logic of the project is based on the analysis of the causes of violent extremism – the ‘why’
61 According to the 2020 Conflict and Peace Analysis: ‘in the absence of hope for future, the youth will start to look for answers elsewhere and may
find these in the more extremist religious forms of Islam’.
62 The project team undertook a series of consultations with government stakeholders and CSOs

As well as the Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security. The resolution 1325 (2000) addresses the impact of war on women and the importance
of women’s full and equal participation in conflict resolution, peacebuilding, peacekeeping, humanitarian response and in post-conflict reconstruction.
The resolution also calls for special measures to protect women and girls from conflict-related sexual violence and outlines gender-related
responsibilities of the United Nations in different political and programmatic areas.
37
While targeting youth as main beneficiary, the project gave particular importance65 to the educational
deficiencies that ‘can render youth unable to withstand and challenge the messages of those who
promote violence’.66 The analysis conducted as part of the PPP found that poor teaching standards
and a lack of focus on developing functional literacy and civic competencies such as critical thinking
and self-reflection limit young people’s resilience to propaganda of violence.67
The project assumed conditions for radicalization can arise when those educational deficiencies
combine with a lack of opportunities for youth to raise their voice and participate in the public life
and a distrust of the government68.
The evaluation found that the assumed interconnection between educational deficiencies, lack of trust,
and lack of voice is supported by research on the cause vulnerability to violent ideologies for youth69.
95 per cent of project stakeholders who were interviewed agreed that the interlinkage between those
elements had a negative effect on youth, pushing them towards a radicalization path.
It should also be noted that analyses conducted on violent extremism and on the drivers of the conflict
in Kyrgyzstan conducted after the project was designed confirmed some of the main problems that
the project wanted to address. For instance, the 2020 Conflict and Peace Analysis conducted by
PeaceNexus70 suggested that, among other elements, perceptions of exclusion from decision-making
65 The focus on ‘educational deficiencies’ is also confirmed by the project budget commitment that is higher for output 1.1 (civic competencies) than for
the other 2.

enable them to participate effectively and productively in life”. Stated in the Youth and Public Policy in Kyrgyzstan, p 27
68 Concerning the focus on educational deficiencies, beliefs, attitudes and not on rule of law, socio economic opportunities, one could argue that the
project addressed the pull factors of VE rather than push factors. Push factors: The conditions conducive to violent extremism and the structural
context from which it emerges. These include lack of socio-economic opportunities; marginalization and discrimination; poor governance, violations
of human rights and the Rule of Law; prolonged and unresolved conflicts; and radicalization in prisons.
Pull factors: The individual motivations and processes, which play a key role in transforming ideas and grievances into violent extremist action. These
include: individual backgrounds and motivations; collective grievances and victimization stemming from domination, oppression, subjugation or
foreign intervention; distortion and misuse of beliefs, political ideologies and ethnic and cultural differences; and leadership and social networks.
In other words, push factors relate to the structural factors in the society, while pull factors refer to psychological condition of individual that can make
him/her more vulnerable to undertaking violent extremist behavior. General Assembly report A/70/674, paras. 23 and 32-37; United Nations, Swiss
Confederation, (2016), p. 4
69 This is in line, for instance with UNICEF, in its 2015 Situation Analysis of the situation of children in Kyrgyzstan, highlights the following conflict
dynamics and peacebuilding needs that are of particular relevance for children and youth in Kyrgyzstan – with over half of the population in Kyrgyzstan
being under the age of 25:
• Young people and adolescents have been seen mainly as victims or perpetrators of existing conflicts. The importance of recognizing and
leveraging the capacity of young people and adolescents to contribute to Kyrgyzstan’s development and stability has often been overlooked;
• Poverty and economic opportunities are limited, especially for young people. Unemployment is high. This often only leaves labor migration
to either urban areas or to other countries (usually Russia or Kazakhstan) as feasible livelihood options for young people
• There are limited opportunities for young people and adolescents to make their voices heard in the public or private domains;
The concept of citizenship is poorly developed among young people, and democratic values are not strongly rooted. Identity formation
based on ethnicity, religion, clan, and/or regionalism are becoming more prominent especially among young people and has widened the
gap between ethnicities in the country.
• Overall, the education system is deteriorating. The existing formal and informal education systems leave little room for the development of
functional literacy and civic competencies such as critical thinking, self-reflection, communication and peaceful conflict prevention. School
dropout rates are high, and the limited social opportunities create conditions for e.g. petty crime, fights, and alcohol consumption;
• Young people are particularly susceptible to political and religious radicalization. There is a high prevalence of violence in families and
schools, particularly against children and youth. Violence is viewed as socially acceptable.
• Young people have little trust in state institutions, as those institutions tend to provide unequal access to quality public services, leaving
room for discriminatory approaches and deprivation from social, economic, cultural, civil and political rights.
• Kyrgyzstan has a patriarchal and masculinity-based culture. ‘Youth issues’ are often framed from the perspective of young men, rather than
both men and women. This often leads to limited participation of young women in youth initiatives, youth groups, or youth wings of
political parties. There is gender-based discrimination in the labor market and in society as a whole; and gender-based violence –particularly
in the context of early marriages, abduction for forced marriage, sexual violence, and trafficking – are not properly reflected.
Also, see the unpublished report on the study commissioned by UNCT and run by Anna Matveeva: “Religious radicalization leading to violent
extremism in Kyrgyzstan” pp. 16-18 posits that younger people, especially those from ethnic minorities, are dissatisfied with what the state offers
them.

of women, youth, and minority ethnic groups, and the inadequate quality of the education system are
some of the major risk factors for the country71. The ‘localized analysis’, conducted in 2020 to better
understand the factors of radicalization that may inspire violent extremism, also highlighted some of
the issues of education, marginalization and discrimination
An area of uncertainty, however, that emerged from the interviews, FGDs and analysis of the
documentation: the lack of a clear definition and agreement on violent extremism and radicalization72. The analysis
of the documentation73 coupled with the interviews confirmed that there was an absence of shared
understating of PVE issues in the country across different levels of the society and among project
stakeholders.
According to most of the stakeholders interviewed, this had at least a slight negative affect on the
design and implementation of the project. The lack of definition meant that stakeholders had slightly
different perspectives of what the project wanted to achieve. Interviews with some stakeholders that
there was some slight confusion on those concepts and appropriate project strategy, especially at the
beginning of the project74.
Quote:
Everyone understood radicalization and VE differently, and the first meetings with the UN focused on discussing
different views of radicalization…. Only during implementation did everyone came to a shared understanding (Interview
with NGO).
UN staff and implementing partners managed to overcome those differences in terms of their
understanding of VE during project implementation through a series of meetings. However, the same
cannot be said for the beneficiaries75. Interviews with youth, adults, and community leaders showed
that a large majority could not differentiate between different terms such as VE, radicalization and
counterterrorism. For some, especially youth, the relationship between PVE and the activities they
participated in was unclear. Putting forward a definition of violent extremism76 and an explanation of
the difference between violent extremism and radicalization77 at the beginning of the project might
have benefited the discussion at conception and during implementation78. A common definition,
71 It is interesting to note that there is quite a substantial overlap between the identified root causes of violent extremism and the drivers of conflict in
Kyrgyzstan
72 According to a research on VE, ‘the countering violent extremism (CVE) and PVE are relatively new fields, and their methodology is developing
along the way. (Marc Sommers, “Trust-Based, Qualitative Field Methods A Manual for Researchers of Violent Extremism,” IGAD Center of
Excellence for Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism (2019)
73 For instance, annual progress report 2018 and the evaluation on the L&A approach
74 Also, one could argue that, without a clear agreement or definition of what violent extremism is, it is more challenging to clearly define all the root
cause of that and therefore to develop an appropriate approach to prevent it and devise indicators to measure it (see section on efficiency).
75 For example, vulnerable women, interpreted radicalization as outbreak of violence, including the domestic violence, drop out from education
system, joining prohibited groups.
76 UN recognizes that the development of a common understanding will help in the fight against radicalization and gives the prerogative of finding own
definition to each UN member country. The United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism, Report
of the Secretary-General (2015).
77 Often “violent extremism” is used interchangeable with “radicalization”. According to Striegher, they have a strong interdependence, but a certain
demarcation line has to be drawn. His segregation of concepts is based on the logic that ideological goals of the person justifying violence go through
“the process of radicalization that leads to the adoption of VE as an ideology, where terrorism is solely the act of violence carried out in pursuit of these
goals.”[1] Neumann, also thinks that VE is broader and more nuanced “because it accommodates any kind of violence as long as its motivation is deemed
extremist.”[2] [1] Jason-Leigh Striegher, “Violent-extremism: an examination of a definitional dilemma,” Australian Security and Intelligence Conference
(2015), 752] Peter R. Neumann, “Countering Violent Extremism and Radicalization that Lead to Terrorism: Ideas, Recommendations, and Good Practices
from the OSCE Region”, International Centre for the Study of Radicalization (ICSR), King’s College London (2017), 15
78 The localized analysis, based on the assumption that the lack of a clarification of what VE is, proposes some definition ‘Therefore, to avoid
confusion and to build common understanding, the definition of the term ‘radicalization’ is included in the report.’

could have also better explained why the project wanted to focus on some of the root causes, such as
educational deficiencies, instead of others, such as lack of employment opportunities. It also would
have clarified the overlap between the most specific drivers of PVE and the core generic drivers of
conflict in the country.79
To avoid confusion, this evaluation report will refer to the definition of radicalization and VE
provided in the localized analysis. This states that ‘radicalization’ is the process by which individuals’
moderate beliefs and views move towards more extreme views, beliefs and even violent actions. The
process of radicalization may therefore lead to the adoption of violent extremism, which include
beliefs, feelings and behaviors that support the use violence as a method of social change. 80
Finding 2. The approach and the strategy developed by the project was innovative and was
adequately devised to address (some of) the root causes of violent extremism

…
The evaluation found that the project appropriately linked its intended objectives with some of the
causes of violent extremism identified in the reconstructed TOC.
The project aimed at addressing some drivers of violent extremism described above and at building
resilience to violent and manipulative ideologies by developing a threefold approach of education,
empowerment and dialogue. The project was composed of 3 outputs:
1. Output 1 aimed at developing non-violent culture and civic competencies at secondary level
in secular and religious settings for youth while at the same time improving the capacity of
education workers to facilitate the learning of non-violent culture
2. Output 2 aimed at strengthening community engagement to address local vulnerabilities
leading to violent extremis to increase the confidence towards the state. The project envisaged
measures to train local authorities to set specific youth-related indicators in their planning with
the objective of addressing vulnerabilities that may lead to violent ideologies
3. Output 3 aimed at strengthening community dialogue, the capacity of opinion leaders, civil
society activists, marginalized women, and religious leaders so that they could provide
alternative and positive messages within their community (targeting young women and men
particular).
It could be mentioned, however, that some scholars have argued that until researchers and practitioners go past the definitional debate and ‘get on with
developing something useful in the field, resilience will remain nothing more than just another good concept and meaningless buzz-word’ (Longstaff et
al., 2010: 17). We would add that until researchers and policy makers develop and trial approaches that are ‘useful’ (or at least usable) ‘in the field’, we
will continue to lack the ability to test and refine the efficacy of such conceptual approaches based on robust empirical data.
79 For instance, it is interesting to note that despite the fact that several analyses refer to the high levels of youth unemployment as one of the “most
corrosive” conflict drivers and the next big threat to peace, the PBF (and this project) has not made this a priority issue.
80 the localized analysis conducted in 2020
40
Findings from “Journey to Extremism in Africa” show that education must provide life alternatives,
and, as far as possible, instill critical thinking, respect for diversity and citizenship values in preventing
extremism81 According to earlier research by Finkel, “civic education has meaningful and relatively
long-lasting effects in terms of increasing political information, feelings of empowerment, and political
engagement and participation”.82 This is in line with the approach the project developed.
Research has shown the importance of strengthening dialogue with local authorities to prevent violent
extremism. For instance, a strategic study by Search for Common Ground (SFCG) concluded that
improving state-society relations in addition to intercommunity and intergenerational ones is critical
to building community resilience to violent extremism83. Research conducted in the Kyrgyzstani
context has also noted how important local government and educational institutions are in reducing
vulnerability while strengthening resilience to violent extremism.84
The TOC assumed that parents, teachers and community leaders, including vulnerable women, could
be considered as ‘influencers’, so men and women, community and religious leaders were also beneficiaries,
along with youth. The evaluation found that this is line with good practices concerning initiatives
focusing on youth empowerment because the broader ecosystem, especially community and family,
strongly influences young people85. For instance, the 2020 Conflict and Peace Analysis Kyrgyzstan
that was conducted after the project was designed identified parents and teachers as possible barriers
to youth inclusion and participation, especially for young women, and suggested promoting dialogue
with them.
Ninety per cent of interviewees considered the project approach to be innovative. No other project in
the country had previously developed the 3-factor approach discussed above, combining civic
competencies, civic engagement and community dialogue, and empowerment for young women,
including vulnerable women, and men.86 The project also integrated civic education and social skill
training into a curriculum of vocational schools and madrasahs. Several stakeholders noted this as a
unique endeavor due to combining the concepts of citizenship and human rights with Islamic teaching.
Finally, the project integrated a series of specific innovations during implementation. For instance, the
project built on approaches from other countries, using UPSHIFT to focus on design thinking. It also
involved not only imams but also female religious leaders who are usually excluded from community
dialogue.

85 According to an evaluation on UNICEF, ‘while traditional norms are often cited as a barrier to young people’s participation in peacebuilding,
advocacy to government officials, community leaders, parents and other adults who enforce such norms have not been regular or systematic and there
are few initiatives that create spaces for young people to regularly engage with decision-makers or embed young people’s participation in systems,
structures or institutions’ UNICEF Engagement With Young People In Peacebuilding
86 In addition, UN agencies applied certain approaches to working with the beneficiaries. For example, UNWomen promoted Positive Deviance
approaches to attract female champions among the vulnerable who are better informed about local context and know their needs and how to address
particular challenges
41
Finding 3. The project had a strong rationale for its design. However, it did not clearly
articulate its TOC.
Triangulation of information
• Desk review of project document (also literature on VE)
• Interviews with UN staff and implementing partners
• FGDs
…
The literature increasingly shows resilience as a social process supported or inhibited by a range of
interconnected external and contextual factors at individual, family, institutional levels 87. This aligns
with the approach of the project (see also finding 2) that incorporated activities targeting individual
(activities on civic competencies), institutions (activities on civic engagement) and family/community
(activities on civic engagement but also on community dialogue) to strengthen resistance to harms or
the ability to overcome adversity (resilience)88.
The project’s proposed response to some of the factors driving VE was solid in that the chain of
causality is logical and connected to the main drivers of VE. However, the evaluation found that the
TOC was not clearly articulated in the project document. There is just one paragraph explaining what
the TOC is. Also, the explanation does not clearly lay down all the assumptions that the project team
made while developing the project. Finally, the TOC is not visualized with a diagram, which is a good
practice when developing TOCs. The TOC in the document did not follow the PBSO guidance89 on
how to develop TOC for peacebuilding projects. This guidance suggests clearly explain the rationale
behind an intervention and the specific assumptions. It also recommends clarifying competing
assumptions behind different approaches and giving a rationale for choosing one over another. Th
evaluation team had to reconstruct the TOC to validate its decisions (see the methodology section)90.
This should have been done at project design stage.
Finding 4. Project design was based on a good understanding of the needs of youth, especially
vulnerable groups such as young women, including vulnerable women, and men.

88 To develop this report, the evaluation also built on the research conducted as part of on the BRAVE-14 indicators that highlights how youth
resilience to violence is a process that is affected by the interconnection between identity around community, family, trust in the government and
violent behaviors/beliefs (see section on effectiveness).

90 The evaluation team did not gather sufficient evidence about how this was used in practice though.
42
The evaluation found that the project appropriately addressed the needs of the main beneficiaries –
young women, including vulnerable women, and men – as it was also developed and implemented in
collaboration with them. The project engaged with beneficiaries to design part of its activities, taking
their needs into account.91 For instance, the civic education component started with a needs
assessment in pilot vocational schools and madrasas that was conducted together with students.92
Participatory research was conducted among students, with active and equal participation by boys and
girls, in the pilot schools to determine their needs. This informed the new contents and materials to
be produced. Also, the civic education guide and the student workbook were continuously tested and
validated with students so that changes could be made. As a result of the participatory approach, the
project adopted, 85 per cent of youth beneficiaries stated that the project was relevant for them and
able to listen to their needs.
The project was designed to engage young people and women considered marginalized, vulnerable, or
‘hard to reach’93. Based on research, the project assumed that this group of youth are potentially more
susceptible to be recruited by violent extremist groups.94.
The project focused also on ethnic minorities95, as recent research found that most who join violent
groups come from ethnic minorities96. Likewise, this resonates with the findings from research that
ethnic minorities can be more susceptible to violent ideologies due to feeling excluded, discriminated
against, and unable to fulfill themselves in Kyrgyzstan’s current social context.97 To account for ethnic
differences, the project included several activities on multiculturalism/multilingualism. The evaluation
found that this is line with good practices for dealing with resilience to violence and ethnic
discrimination.98
The project design was also prepared in collaboration and partnership with a series of key stakeholders.
Government counterparts, particularly the representatives of the President’s Office, Ministry of
91 For example: UN Women conducted a field needs assessment with religious women and vulnerable women (at least 200 people) to identify areas of
our work and to identify the topics of their interest, how much time they can allocate for trainings, how they are being engaged by local authorities, and
etc
92 Needs assessment was conducted in 11 madrasahs with 400 students
93 Project documents states that project is bringing PVE agenda to traditionally hard to reach groups such as those in isolated minority neighborhoods
through involving diversity of male and female religious leaders as PVE communicators.
94 Unpublished report on the study commissioned by UNCT and run by Anna Matveeva: “Religious radicalization leading to violent extremism in
Kyrgyzstan”. This is also. In line with UNICEF good practices ‘Programs were deliberately designed to engage young people who are being directly
affected by conflict and violence, typically those who are considered to be marginalized, vulnerable, or ‘hard to reach’. Target beneficiaries commonly
include out of school youth, often times refugees or internally displaced by conflict, and sometimes migrant young people’. UNICEF Engagement with
Young People In Peacebuilding Formative Evaluation 2019
95 Those minorities include women and girls from religious backgrounds from closed settings: for instance, UN Women mobilized women and girls
who attend unofficial home-based religion courses and who are easy target to be brainwashed. These women were capacitated on human rights,
gender, public speaking, economic empowerment, etc.
96 According to the 2020 CPA A common narrative among the ethnic Kyrgyz is that the Uzbeks provoked the incidents of June 2010 and that both
Uzbeks and Kyrgyz were victims. Various reports have expressed that the issues of June 2010 are not properly addressed yet. This might have created a
security dilemma among Uzbek community. This might be one of the reasons that among the young people who joined extremist group are found
majority of Uzbek ethnic background. Minority rights and especially the “Uzbek question” continue to be an extremely sensitive issue for the country.

navigate the cultural understandings and assumptions of both their country of origin and their country of domicile’ (Ungar, M. (2008). Resilience across
cultures. British Journal of Social Work 38, 218-35).
‘There is evidence to suggest that people who master the rules and norms of their new culture without abandoning their own language, values and social
support are more resilient than those who tenaciously maintain their own culture at the expense of adjusting to their new environment. They are also
more resilient than those who forego their own culture and assimilate completely with the host society’ (Gunnestad, A. (2006) Resilience in a Cross-
Cultural Perspective: How resilience is generated in different cultures. Journal of Intercultural Communication, 11, http://www.immi.se/intercultural/
nr11/gunnestad.htm).
43
Education and Science, State Youth Agency actively contributed to the project’s design99. For instance,
the government gave input on the selection of the pilot municipalities. Likewise, local self-
governments and regional authorities helped to identify the religious leaders, civil society activists.
Social workers in the municipalities provided the list of vulnerable women.
Finding 5. Project objectives were aligned with both national strategies and UN key
strategies for Kyrgyzstan
Triangulation of information
• Desk review of project document (key government and UN strategic document)
• Interviews with UN staff and implementing partners and with beneficiaries
• FGDs
The evaluation found the project consistent with key priorities that the government of Kyrgyzstan
wanted to address. As mentioned in the background section of this report, violent extremism has been
a high-level priority for the government of Kyrgyzstan in recent years because of the increasing threat.
The government has adopted a national program on countering religious extremism and terrorism
from 2017-2022 that prioritized adopting non-punitive measures.100
There is anecdotal evidence101 that PBF and the UN have played an instrumental role in encouraging
the government not only to accept the need to address extremism but to use a preventive approach
such as that implemented in this project.
The project also aligned with national priorities, as education is enshrined as a strategy of sustaining
peace and cohesion in the governmental flagship 2018-2022 program, “Unity, Trust, Creativity” 2018-
2022. The introduction of civic education and social skills in madrasahs provides an opportunity to
make these education institutions more open, quality, and inclusive. The project also aligns with the
Kyrgyz Government Action Plan for 2018-2020 to ensure the implementation of United Nations
Security Council Resolution 1325 (the Kyrgyz Government decreet dated September 21, 2018, No.
334-p). The plan aimed at strengthening the role and participation of women in preserving peace and
security, including at the decision-making level. It also aims at preventing the impact of conflict and
risks of violence towards women and girls, and improving social protection and meeting special needs
of women and girls in emergencies
99 The workplan of the project includes several initial activities to Workplan – efforts to engage and communicate with stakeholders (‘Local and national
partners are aware of the project goals and expected outcomes and endorse them’)
100 The government of Kyrgyzstan does not use the word ‘violent extremism” in its strategy and documents. According to the interviews conducted with
officials from government, any extremism or terrorism is violent by default One example that was given is the case of Hizb-ut-Tahrir in our country,
which wants to create Halifat but by gaining minds and hearts of people, i.e. through non-violent way, but it is found as extremist organization by Kyrgyz
law, because they try to overthrow the constitutional order in the country. But according to Kyrgyz legislation, and government position, it is extremist
activity when they invite to change the constitutional order, and therefore it is extremist, but Kyrgyz government does not want to use the word ‘violent'
101 United Nations University Centre for Policy Research What Works in UN Resident Coordinator-led Conflict Prevention: Lessons from the Field
June 2018 The government did not have a sound preventive approach to violent extremism until the UN developed the PPP on violent extremism in
collaboration with them
44
Finally, the project aligned with the UN Development Assistance Framework, the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs):
• SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions): This SDG also relates to reduction of
violence (for instance, indicator 16.1 - Significantly reduce all forms of violence), so it is
directly linked to the project under review.
• SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities): This SDG focuses also on ensuring that no one is left behind
(for instance, indicator 10.2 By 2030, empower and promote the social, economic and political
inclusion of all, irrespective of age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic
or other status), so there is a direct connection with this project’s aims to empower vulnerable
groups.
• SDG 5 (Gender Equality): The connection with this SDG is solid, as the project aims at
empowering women, also vulnerable women, through UN Women support. the project relates
to several of the indicators under this SDG, such as indicator 5.2 “Eliminate all forms of
violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, including trafficking
and sexual and other types of exploitation”.
• SDG 4 (Education): The project adopted an educational approach so that the connection with
this SDG and most of its indicators is evident.
Coherence
Main question: To what extent was the project internally coherent and to what extent was it externally coherent so as to
be developed and implemented in synergy with other stakeholders’ interventions on peacebuilding?
Sub questions:
2.1 To what extent UNICEF, UN Women and UNFPA were able to ensure coherence, synergies and joint operation in
design and implementation of the project?
2.2 To what extent this project was designed and implemented in a complimentary, harmonized, coordinated fashion with
the governments’ and other peacebuilding actors’ interventions?
This section addresses the main question and sub-questions related to the coherence criterion. Finding
6 shows how the project was designed and implemented based on the comparative advantage of each
agency, and the UN agencies collaborated effectively. Finding 7 shows that there were some obstacles
in understanding the roles and responsibilities of each agency, and minor obstacles such as conducting
joint M&E. Finding 8 shows that the project identified several complementary projects, but it did not
create solid partnerships with all donors and partners (Finding 8).
Finding 6: The project was designed and implemented building on the comparative
advantage of each agency; there was strong willingness to coordinate and collaborate.

45
UN Women, UNICEF and UNFPA complemented each other by using their expertise and network
to carry out project activities, and evidence shows that this benefited the project. For example,
UNICEF was instrumental for UN Women to get easy access to the Ministry of Education so that
UN Women could work on the activities related to the textbook review.102 Likewise, UN Women was
instrumental to UNFPA’s research on how religious institutions developed and integrated civic
education in their programs, and these results informed some activities by UNFPA.
There is also anecdotal evidence that agencies relied on each other’s experience and expertise on
peacebuilding to implement their respective tasks. While this evaluation did not conduct an in-depth
assessment of the project staff expertise and skills, there are indicators of some cross-fertilization
between agencies. For instance, one staff member of UNICEF was supported to implement one of
the project activities by another person in UNFPA who had some solid peacebuilding expertise.103
When working together, agencies built on each other’s comparative advantage and expertise to solve
project challenges104.
Similarly, the interviews with CSOs and implementing partners confirmed that most were satisfied by
the cooperation with the 3 UN agencies
Quote:
But there were no difficulties in cooperation with UN partners. We always sat and discussed arising issues.
(Interview with implementing partner)
The evaluation found inter-agency and implementing-partner cooperation was facilitated by…
● Willingness of the agencies to cooperate. Ninety per cent of stakeholders interviewed from
the agencies confirmed that there was solid cooperation between the agencies.
● An overall clear vision for project achievements. The interviews and FGDs confirmed that
agencies clearly understood the rationale behind the project and its objectives.105
● Clarity of the comparative advantage of each agency. Focusing project objectives on civic
competencies and civic engagement for youth, community dialogue and women
empowerment, allowed clearly establishing the comparative advantage and the added value
was for each agency even when specific roles were undefined.
Quote:
it was clear from the beginning what the added value of each organization was. For instance, we really liked
that UNICEF brought an integrated approach and some innovative approaches to child education. (interview
with UN staff)
102 The activities foreseen are the following:
- 1.1.1.b. Revision of educational standards in the field of civic education in order to enhance key competencies that better enable resistance to violent
ideologies (grades 5-11)
- 1.1.1.c. Development of gender and age sensitive teaching and methodological materials fostering non-violent culture and civic competencies in
students (grades 7-9)
103 There is an ongoing discussion on this subject – the capacity of UN agencies on peacebuilding. For instance, drawing on evaluations and evaluative
exercises of initiatives supported by the Fund Some UN entities have peacebuilding at the core of their mandates, such as the Department of Peace and
Political Affairs (DPPA) and UNDP. Most multi-mandate UN agencies, however, do not have peacebuilding as a central concern, including FAO,
UNFPA, WFP, WHO, IOM, ILO, and UNICEF, all of which are fund-recipients of PBF. Several of these agencies have taken steps towards increasing
their understanding and capacities in peacebuilding in recent years and are making efforts to make sense of the Sustaining Peace and Humanitarian-
Development-Peace nexus agendas in practice for their organizations.
104 UN Women also cooperated with UNFPA and conducted joint activities with them to ensure the participation of women in UNFPA events
105 However, as mentioned earlier, the lack of definition on violent extremism created some minor challenges especially at the beginning of the
implementation of the project.
46
● Leadership by the UN Resident Coordinator and the PBF secretariat. The evaluation found
that the UN RC closely followed the project’s progress and tried to facilitate collaboration
between agencies by activities such as formal and informal meetings).106 The PBF secretariat
also ensured that collaboration happened within the project.107
Collaboration among agencies took place mainly through regular formal meetings as part of the Joint
Steering Committee, regular meetings organized by PBF Secretariat, and ad-hoc meetings such as
those organized as part of the Adaptation and Learning Approach.
The TOC assumption at the input level that the joint programming would be effective and beneficial
to the project design and implementation was validated, with some minor caveats described in the
section below.
Finding 7: A more effective joint program could be developed from overcoming some minor
obstacles such clarifying specific roles of each agency and collaborating on key issues such
as monitoring.
Triangulation of information
• Desk review of project document (project document, annual and semi-annual report)

The 2014 guidance joint programming108 states that ‘a Joint Program is a set of activities contained in
a joint work plan and related common budgetary framework, involving two or more UN organizations and
(sub-) national governmental partners, intended to achieve results aligned with national priorities as
reflected in UNDAF/One Program or an equivalent programming instrument or development
framework. The work plan and budgetary framework form part of a Joint Program Document, which details
roles and responsibilities of partners in coordinating and managing the joint activities.
The evaluation found that, while the cooperation was solid overall, as mentioned above, there is still
room for improvement. Some minor obstacles to effective collaboration are described as follows:
● The document included a description of the comparative advantage of each agency, yet it did
not clearly define the roles and responsibilities of each agency and their specific tasks.
Likewise, the ‘joint workplan’ reviewed by the evaluation team set out the activities that would
be carried out during each year of the Joint Program. However, there was no clarification on
what the expected outputs and outcomes were for those activities. There was also no
description of the inputs needed to carry out the activities, and no budget for completing those
106 It was also under the leadership of the new RC that the CPA and localized analyses were conducted so as to better understand the root cause of

activities. The 2014 guidance note on joint programs says these clarifications are good
practices.109
Quote
Without better clarifying our roles and responsibilities, we can run into the risk of giving too much weight to informal
elements such as the personality of the program manager or the RC in facilitating or hampering the implementation of a
project (Interview with UN staff).
● Monitoring, reporting and knowledge management were not always properly documented by
the collaborating agencies. Some of the stakeholders interviewed reported not being always up
to date with the activities and progress of the project, especially regarding what the other
agencies were doing.
While the evaluation did not find evidence that those obstacles led to major difficulties, with the
exception of the monitoring reporting related issues to be discussed in-depth in the efficiency section,
there were some missed opportunities for effective collaboration.
Quote:
We spent quite some time at the beginning for program to understand each other and set boundaries. It was a long
process, but finally we were able to do so. Perhaps, some things should be more formalized before the start of a project.
(Interview with UN staff)
The evaluation identified one possible root cause for those obstacles as the legacy agencies have in
developing their own procedures, systems, and cultures.
Quote:
We all have different procedures, annual working plans and calendar events, it is rather difficult to coordinate and
synchronize. We are not used to doing so, but we are trying to do it more. (Interview with UN staff)
Quote:
On joint projects, there is still a long way to go as agencies are used to running their own ship, and they are not horizontally
accountable. When you look at the project reports, sometimes you look at 3 different reports that then need to be merged
together. (Interview with UN staff)
Some stakeholders also reflected that the lack of a strategic framework at UNCT level might hinder
collaboration between agencies. A strategic framework could better clarify the long-term objectives,
specify the needed expertise to achieve those objectives and clarity the responsible implementation
agency110. This position is confirmed by recent previous evaluations proposing development of such
strategic frameworks.
109 According to a recent evaluation ‘Role clarity between different UN actors in complex country configurations is essential to increase coherence, as
well as funding coherence, including a clearer articulation of PBF’s particular niche and role in relation to other funding sources and donors’ Synthesis
review 2017-2019 PBF project and portfolio evaluations
110 The current steps towards developing 5-year strategic frameworks are an important milestone for PBF to commit to longer time horizons. In 2020,
PBF has started to support the development of two strategic framework processes that were both underway at the time of writing of this report:
Guatemala and a regional framework for the Balkans. The overall idea behind these processes is to develop a framework at the portfolio level (with
participation from RUNOs, NUNOs, government and civil society to varying degrees) to provide an overall strategic orientation for PBF portfolio in
country, beyond specific projects and programs.
48
Quote:
However, overall UN coherence is limited by the absence of a strategic framework at the UNCT level, and the fact
that the PPP (Peacebuilding Priority Plan) was abolished without putting in place another strategic framework that
would support UNCT strategic planning at the portfolio level to work more consistently towards collective impacts at
portfolio levels. (Synthesis review 2017-2019 PBF project and portfolio evaluations)
Without a broader strategic framework, we feel there is a high level of unpredictability on peacebuilding funds when we
work on concepts and issues that require long horizons for change (FGD with UN staff)
Finding 8. At the design stage, the project did identify several projects that were
complementary, yet it did not manage to create solid partnerships with external partners
and donors

The TOC assumed that the project would ensure solid coherence with other complementary projects
at input level. This could have benefited the project by identifying synergies and collaborating with
partners on common issues. This assumption was only partly validated by this evaluation.
The project document included a well-articulated table outlining possible synergies and
complementarities with existing projects.111 The interviews confirmed that the main stakeholders were
aware of complementary projects in Kyrgyzstan.112 This led to the project avoiding duplication with
other complementary projects. For instance, the project decided not to select areas where other similar
projects were being implemented. However, not all the stakeholders interviewed were aware of other
projects funded by PBF in Kyrgyzstan113 or in other countries, and not all knew how to gather
information such as good practices from previous projects.

The evaluation found limited evidence that the project interacted with complementary projects and
other partners during implementation in ways that led to effective adaptation and learning. There is
also little evidence that the project interacted with other agencies involved in the implementation of
the outcomes 1 and 2 of the PPP114.
There is, however, evidence that the project developed a solid partnership with the government (see
also the section on relevance, effectiveness, and sustainability). The government participated actively
in the project design. In particular, the Ministry of Education and Science, the State and Youth Agency,
the Presidents’ Office and the SCVRA were active in implementing project activities. For example,
the MoES endorsed the non-discrimination gender-sensitive methodology, the MoU signed by the
VEA to scale up civic education in that sector.
Effectiveness/Impact
3. Main question: To what extent did the project achieve its objectives?
Sub questions:
3.1 To what extent have the project’s results (outputs and outcomes) been achieved?
3.2 Have there been unintended positive or negative results?
This section addresses the main question and sub-questions related to the effectiveness criterion. The
TOC of the project anticipated that if the young people in the communities have critical thinking and
other life skills which enable them to positively claim and exercise their rights through civic
engagement and interaction with local self-government bodies, they will become resilient to violent
and manipulative ideologies. The logic behind this and how this resonated with the existing academic
literature is described in detail in the relevance section of this report.
The reconstructed TOC shows that the project expected that:
• Empowering youth and women, and increasing their analytical skills would allow them to take
a more critical stance to violence (programmatic pathway within output 1). Also, empowering
youth to take part in initiatives with local authorities would reinforce their confidence.
• Empowering also other beneficiaries such as parents, community members and local
authorities, would allow them to better understand youth priorities, listen to their needs and
send positive messages (output 2 and 3).
• Ultimately, the combination and interconnection between those outputs (young women,
including vulnerable women, and men are empowered, they have a stronger trust in the state,
and they also feel closer to their community) would strengthen resilience to violence for youth
and women.
Finding 9 is that there is evidence that the project contributed to youth empowerment with significant
results for boys and girls in terms of strengthening their confidence, critical thinking, skills, teamwork,
114 The project did hold some meetings with the other agencies involved in the implementation of the other outcomes but only at the beginning of the
project. One of the reasons this stopped it is because of COVID-19. Also, it should be mentioned that the work with LSG on social inclusive and
gender sensitive programming at local level was implemented by UN Women in Outcome 1 and is to be considered as a good platform for women
from vulnerable groups to be a part of this local planning,
50
etc. Finding 10 is that there is evidence of empowerment of (vulnerable) women (and girls) with
transformative personal results generated by the project. These include building confidence, new
businesses, pursuing new goals, and new interactions between secular and religious women. Finding
11 is that other beneficiaries such as local authorities have also been empowered to engage with youth
and to deliver positive messages to counter violent extremism. Finding 12 is that there is some
evidence that the overall approach of the project, with the interconnected outputs, has had some
positive impact on youth resilience to violence.
Finding 9. There is evidence that the project contributed to youth empowerment with
significant results for boys and girls in terms of strengthening their confidence, critical
thinking, skills, teamwork, etc. This was instrumental for youth to take a critical stance to
violence

Individual level (output 1 civic education) – The logic of the first project component was to
empower youth by slightly revising the curricula on civic education to make youth more critical
thinkers, more open to diversity and tolerant and, more sensitive to gender issues. This involved
developing a methodology and a series of trainings for teachers.
This evaluation found substantial evidence that youth were empowered by project activities, and that
this empowerment was instrumental for them to take a more critical stance to violence and messages
promoting violence.
The analysis of the TOC showed that the project achieved its intended results under this component
as by successfully building skills among youth and adolescents in formal (vocational and secondary
schools) and informal educational settings (madrasahs)115. The evaluation team had ample evidence
on empowerment of the young people involved in the project. Youth shared individual examples of
increased confidence, critical thinking, strengthened teamwork, increased motivation in participating
in social initiatives, and increased interaction with peers from other regions.
Quote:
I like the trainer and the atmosphere they created. We made friends with other young people from Naryn (interview
with young female from Issyk-Kul province).
115 The project did not have any baseline values for its indicators. To overcome this problem, the current evaluation gathered qualitative and
quantitative data and reconstructed the TOC to be able to validate the main assumptions and clearly show the logical chain of results
51
Quote:
I really liked that there was no discrimination in the project regarding nationalities. There was a friendly spirit. I also
learnt a lot of new information, for example, about leadership, teamwork (interview with young female from Osh
province from vulnerable groups).
Quote:
I learnt to identify problems of our community, to solve them and make a presentation of our ideas (interview with
young male participant from Jalalabad province,15 years old).
“Because of my disability, the boys from my school used to humiliate me. One day I even was thrown into a trash can by
my classmates, where I remained for 1.5 hours because of fear. But I am not the same person now, I have changed a lot.
Now I can openly speak up if someone is doing wrong, if I see wrong things around, and if I see any violence going on
around, because I have a sense of confidence. Through this training and these initiatives, I have learnt to stand up for
myself. I even became our school president. I am very grateful to FTI for such projects! Thanks to them, my life has
significantly changed!” (interview with young adult)
Project interventions under Output 1, civic education, fostered individual-level changes targeting
youth in three types of educational settings: mainstream school, vocational professional schools, and
madrasas. The results for each setting are described, in more detail, below.
Civic education in secondary schools
The MOES introduced into the current state’s teacher’s training program through two training
manuals developed within the framework of the project. The first focuses on non-discrimination,
gender expertise, and mainstreaming gender and non-discrimination in educational settings. The
second focuses on civic competency teaching methodology.116 These manuals were endorsed through
training that sensitized education sector employees and schoolteachers towards non-discrimination
and gender equality principles117. 2,507 upper secondary students (grades 7-11; 1,169 boys and 1,338
girls) from 32 schools in 11 target municipalities enhanced their knowledge on civic competencies of
social inclusion, diversity and gender equality thanks to the 50 teachers trained by the project.118 The
competence level of the students was assessed by pre and post-tests, which showed an approximately
35 per cent increase of the level of sensitivity of the students at the end of the program. The final
general level of knowledge of the gender and non-discrimination topic was 69 per cent (girls 69% and
boys 63%) at the post-test. As noted by the project partner, there was difference in perceptions of
gender equality among boys and girls: “Girls did not know that their rights are equal to the boys’ rights. They
thought that their destiny is different from the boys. They did not know that they can plan their own lives by themselves.
Boys knew about equality among men and women. At the end, they learnt that, for example, they can wash dishes like
girls, and it is not a shame to do it”.119
116 The Ministry of Education and Science approved two educational modules: “Gender, non-discrimination in school education: for specialists in
education”, “Learning living together: methodological guidance on developing basic competencies of school children in gender and non-discrimination
for teacher of social sciences” in Kyrgyz, Uzbek and Russian languages. The module is accessible via https://book.iukedu.kg/ru and was included as
72-hour obligatory course within the professional training program for the teachers of “History” and “Human and Society” school subjects, and 8-
hour course for the teachers of the other specialization areas on the basis of the Republican Institute of Teacher Training (RITT) programs.
117 It should also be mentioned that Un Women TV developed some video lessons with the aim to sharpen students’ civic competencies in
Kyrgyzstan

Additionally, the project reviewed 15 school textbooks120 from a gender perspective, with
recommendations for further use. As a result, the methodology of conducting gender and anti-
discrimination expertise of educational materials was adopted by the MoES. 121 To develop and publish
high-quality textbooks of a new generation, the MoES further developed a draft Regulation "On the
procedure for selecting textbooks (educational and methodological complexes) for educational
organizations of the Kyrgyz Republic”.122 The regulation provides four types of mandatory textbook
examinations: scientific expertise, scientific and pedagogical expertise, practical and pedagogical
expertise (approbation), and anti-discrimination and gender expertise. 123 This means that all books
issued and disseminated by the MoES are now subject to mandatory gender and anti-discrimination
review. As reported by the project, this methodology has already been applied on 40 textbooks and
none has passed the expert review due to discriminatory and gender-blind text and images.
To increase public awareness about non-violent culture and civic competencies, the project supported
the development of 28 learning124, media, and educational materials and conducted an online
information campaign through social media, with an outreach of approximately 784,405 views.125
However, during the project evaluation, a concern was raised by education and gender professionals
regarding the limited technical capacity of the Ministry of Education and Science to further lead the
initiative. The initiative envisages building capacity of teaching staff on gender and non-discrimination
practices, implementing these practices in schools, regularly updating methodological materials,
guiding textbook authors, etc. It was stressed that further technical support would be needed for the
MoES build this into practice.
Civic education in vocational schools
Eight vocational schools were targeted by the project for developing and piloting new content and
methodological materials for instructors/teaching staff of the course, "The Legal Basis for
Professional Activity" (referred in the project as civic education course). The civic education course was
developed by the project working group and consisted of representatives of the Agency of Vocational
Education of the Kyrgyz Republic, the Republican Scientific and Methodological Center, and directors
of professional vocational schools and experts in the field of education. The content of the course
was developed according to the educational standards of primary vocational education of the Kyrgyz
Republic. It consists of 24 academic hours. Revisions from this project include anti-discrimination
concepts and practices, tolerance, gender equality, and human rights. Additionally, this project
elaborated the Teacher’s Guide, Students’ Workbook and Competence Assessment System for the
course. The teachers in the pilot vocational schools underwent 72 academic hours professional
development to teach the course, and they expressed appreciation for the training.
120 UN Women additionally contributed to expertise of Uzbek language books (Uzbek language and Uzbek literature). See here

121 Approved by the MoES, Order № 1096/1, dated 16.09.2019
122 The Regulations has not been approved yet by the Ministry, however, it was publicly discussed.
123 This could be considered an important milestone for embedding the values of human rights, equality, and diversity into the education system.

124 10 TV programs dedicated to five key topics on civil competencies, social inclusion, gender equality and non-discrimination. A series of five TV
programs (5 in Kyrgyz and 5 in Russian) was developed on the following topics: diversity, stereotypes, contemporary inequality, inclusive society, our
rights and opportunities. The YouTube channel has around 5 000 views of these programs at

Quote:
The capacity building training was very useful for us, as our existing teaching staff exercise traditional teaching methods.
New innovative, interactive methods of teaching were presented. My new teaching methods were very appreciated by my
students. They liked the course and were interested in coming to class (Vocational school instructor, Bishkek).
Based on information from the Agency on Vocational Education under the MoES, the course was
recommended to be rolled out to all vocational schools starting in the 2020 academic year. In addition,
the project published 646 copies of course materials in Russian and Kyrgyz languages and distributed
them to vocational schools. However, as shared during the evaluation interview by an instructor who
participated in the project, the Agency had to presumably roll out the training for other teachers to
pass on teaching methodologies and the new content of the course with support of already trained
teaching staff. In total, 219 vocational school students, including 91 girls, benefited from the new
content of this course taught by 25 trained vocational school instructors. In addition, various
workshops, Leadership Academy, camps were arranged to teach civic competences, soft skills, and
life skills.
During the COVID-19 pandemic the project transferred to on-line mode. This involved providing
teachers and students with distance learning podcasts, animated videos, and video tutorials/lessons
along with several online events on topics such as media literacy, tolerance, and information on
COVID-19 pandemic.
The project’s positive impact on youth resembles its impact in secondary schools. As shown in the
graph below (graph 1), youth improved considerably their soft skills related to civic competencies
(students) and teaching skills (teachers). As a result, 78 per cent of students and 73 per cent of teachers
succeeded in showing tolerance, respect for diversity and human rights because of project
interventions. Most importantly, 74 per cent of students and 81 per cent of teachers showed a
preference for resolving everyday conflicts through peaceful and non-violent means. This (see also
sections below) is a confirmation that the educational approach taken by the project had a positive
impact on youth beliefs and behaviors related to violence.

Civic education in madrasahs
Since over 6000126 students attend madrassahs, the project addressed the issue of integrating secular
subjects in religious education settings. A civic education course was developed and introduced into
the curriculum of 11 madrasahs in the pilot locations. At least 240 young people benefited from the
course. 40 madrasah teachers underwent intensive training to deliver the new course. According to
the project post-activity survey of 101 students and 79 teachers, 81 per cent of respondents
demonstrated support for gender equality and women’s empowerment, while 76.6 per cent reported
having higher tolerance, and respect for diversity and human rights.127
In addition, a civic education mobile application, “A journey to civil-land”, was developed to support
the learning. This is compatible with Android and IOS devices and has over 100 downloads as of the
time of writing this report.
Overall, the civic education course in madrasahs was an innovative and timely attempt to integrate the
concepts of citizenship and human rights into Islamic teaching in the Kyrgyzstan context.
Finding 10 – There is evidence of empowerment of (vulnerable) women and girls with
transformative personal results such as increased confidence, new
businesses, new goals, new interactions between secular and religious women.

This evaluation found that the project paid specific attention to women, especially vulnerable women.
The TOC rightly included vulnerable and other women into the process of building resilience to
violent and manipulative ideologies in the communities by empowering them to positively claim and
exercise the rights. This was done through civic education component in the vocational schools and
madrasas, and through empowering vulnerable women in communities.
The project evaluation gathered evidence and testimonials of participating women, including the most
vulnerable and disadvantaged ones, who were successful in gaining confidence and self-esteem due to
project participation.
Quote:
I really liked that it’s possible to provide unemployed women with jobs. That they [women] can find a way out of
situations on their own, without hoping that someone else would defend their rights. Issues related to parenting and critical
thinking were raised. We discussed how children can defend their rights. For example, people of the Uzbek nationality,
especially girls after the 9th grade, mostly get married. We discussed how we can make decisions on our own, and not
depend on someone else's opinion. I was depressed because I could not find a job, and when I wrote my own project and
got supported, my soul opened, and I began to enjoy life. I felt joy when I bought sewing machines… the first thing we
started to sew were face masks. I sewed and handed out the masks absolutely for free, and it brought me a great pleasure!
(interview with female participant from Osh province).
The project worked with women on development and implementation of social projects for their
communities. It also helped them develop new businesses and start-ups. At least 200 women and girls
from vulnerable groups across 12 target municipalities strengthened their knowledge and skills in small
scale income-generating activities and entrepreneurship, including developing business ideas and
starting their own business128. In total, 46 small scale initiatives were jointly designed by 93 women
and girls from vulnerable groups across 12 pilot municipalities. Through the dialogue process, selected
initiatives were implemented to facilitate their active civic engagement, to articulate the burdens of the
vulnerable community member, to address causes of insecurity, and to prevent discriminatory
practices such as domestic violence, bride abduction, and early marriages129. These initiatives included
sewing and baking centers, greenhouses and gardening, event management services, printing/copying
services, consultations center on PVE and peacebuilding, sport center for women, installation of video
cameras and electricity in and around new settlements of Bishkek city, and planting flowers and trees
in communities.
128 Project Annual Report 2020.
129 For example, the women conducted initiatives to prevent discriminatory practices such as campaign "Life without violence" as part of a 16-day
campaign against gender-based violence (December 2019, 2020, Bishkek). The project participating women started actively being part of celebrations
devoted to International Peace Day, global campaign “16 Days of Activism against Gender-based Violence”, the International Day of the Girl Child.
56
The income generation initiatives positively supported the women’s economic interdependency and
empowerment. However, not all the women were able to further develop their start-up projects after
the project ended due to contextual factors, such as a lack of additional equipment expected to be
provided by the municipality. It should be noted that UN Women reports that additional funds have
been mobilized from other organizations to ensure the sustainability of these initiatives.
The income-generating activities resulted in many success stories of women’s political empowerment
and leadership. For example, the project provided capacity building and support for women to start a
flower business and sewing workshop began in Bishkek. Notably, three women who received training
and financial support from the project became deputies of local councils[1].
Women also contributed responding to the COVID-2019 crisis. For example, women in Alla Anarov
municipality who completed the sewing courses with support of the project, sewed and donated 2000
face masks to vulnerable community members. Women, with support of project gender experts,
mobilized financial resources and distributed food packages to six women from Osh City. In addition,
UN Women distributed basic hygiene kits for the most vulnerable women. These kits contained
cleansing wipes, reusable face masks, essential hygiene items, liquid soap, sanitizers, detergent and
much more. These kits were distributed by the local projects’ gender experts, who delivered them to
women at the time of lock down despite a high risk on contamination to themselves.
The project initiated a dialog on secular themes among local religious leaders, women and other
community members. As a result, religious leaders supported human rights and equality by organizing
a seminar on “Child and women rights” for religious people, police and other community members
in Osh, and on the talk shows, “Women in Islam”, and “Islam the religion of peace” to promote the
significance of education.
While this project saw evidence of progress on issues related to women empowerment, these efforts
would need further support for sustainability.
Finding 11. Beneficiaries other than youth, such as local authorities, have been empowered to
engage with youth and to deliver positive messages to counter violent extremism
Triangulation of information
• Interviews with youth participants, parents, teachers, mentors, local self-government
authorities, implementing partners
• Focus group discussion with implementing partners, UN staff
• Project documents, implementing partners narrative reports
Institutional Level (Output 2, civic engagement): The logic of the second project component was
to empower local authorities and facilitate a process of engagement with youth. The expectation was
that this would lead to local authorities opening to dialogue with youth, and listen to their needs,
ultimately increasing youth trust towards government. This evaluation found evidence that this
happened as local authorities started to consider youth priorities in development plans and
demonstrate more willingness to engage with youth. As a result, youth involved in this project
increased their trust in the government (see also section below).
57
This project implementation involved 1,200 adolescents and young people in 18 cities. The
government-run Youth and Child Friendly Local Governance (YCFLG) contest130 has prompted 18
towns to develop child and youth friendly development plans and commit funds for implementation.
2,560 young people were involved in community consultations and advocacy, and 1,600 adolescents
attended participatory research and discussions on local priorities and solutions. 270 girls from
vulnerable communities gained IT skills and developed digital solutions addressing issues of
environmental degradation, sexual and reproductive health, GBV and employability.131
As part of the YCFLG initiative implemented by UNICEF since 2017132, a methodological
recommendations paper (Guide) for local governments on the implementation of youth policy was
developed. The Guide contains a methodological and practical description of actions for LSG bodies
when implementing youth policy in the territory of a municipality by applying participatory approaches
and better articulating consideration of the needs of the beneficiaries.
As mentioned earlier, the evaluation also found evidence that the stakeholders involved in this output,
such as local authorities, learned to better listen to the needs of youth and understood the importance
of considering their perspectives.
Quote:
Through this initiative, it was important for us to engage with youth. We understand we need to consider their priorities
when developing plans (interview with local authority).
Community and Family Level (Output 3, community dialogue):
The logic of the third project component was to empower community members and adults
(integrating output 1 and 2) to greater consider of youth needs and delivering positive influential
messages against violence. The evaluation validated the underpinning assumptions and pathway that
parents, community leaders, other adults were are ‘influencers’.
The project developed training and activities encouraging community groups to participate in local
development discussion and dialogues over PVE. The objective was to promote the idea of tolerance
and gender equality and to involve other community members in dialogue and cooperation through
local initiatives.
In particular, the project reached out to female religious leaders, who are usually excluded from
community dialogue.
Quote:
I think everything in the project was meaningful because I got useful knowledge out of the project. I feel that I have been
useful for women around me. Before, all our educational entities like madrasah, schools, etc. in our community worked
separately. In this project, we worked together—the 10th Department, educators, social pedagogues—we worked together!
We had a very good exchange of ideas. We went to schools, madrasahs to deliver training and seminars that were very
useful for participants. I would recommend continuing these efforts and conducting more similar activities. (a woman
religious leader from Suzak, Jalalabad province).

The project created a platform, especially for women, to speak up on hardships they face in
communities, opening dialogue in the wider society. The project trained over 100 municipality leaders,
with youth councils in 10 municipalities, on strategic planning, and prioritizing issues affecting young
people, including women133. The project also facilitated local dialogue between municipalities, police,
religious leaders, and civil society over the issue of community challenges. This resulted in more than
100 local PVE initiatives with approximately 5000 participants. The communities raised several new
issues and some small-scale youth initiatives focused on limited education and leisure opportunities
for girls, domestic violence, lack of safe spaces for young people (especially girls), environmental
issues, and child marriage.
Finally, there is also solid evidence that parents have also been positively impact from participating
into project activities. The project foresaw several activities targeting adults and making sure they
would participate actively, such as inviting parents when their children would present their final
projects (output 2).

I now realize how important education is for my kid, and I want to let him pursue his dreams (interview with an adult)
Finding 12. There is some early evidence that the overall approach of the project has had some
positive impact on youth resilience to violence
Triangulation of information
• Desk review
• Interviews with youth participants, parents, teachers, mentors, local self-government
authorities, implementing partners
• Guided questionnaire
This evaluation found that the combination and interconnection of project outputs had a positive
impact on youth empowerment, on their trust towards the state and the sense of belonginess in their
community. This has had a positive impact on resilience to violence.
This was confirmed by the results of the guided questionnaire this evaluation developed with a
selection of young people from six sampled communities.134 The results of this questionnaire suggest
that, because of the project, all 3 dimensions (sense of belonging, trust in government and
behavior/beliefs towards violence) have been impacted positively.
Graph 2 shows that sense of belonging to community was fostered among the young people. Seventy-two
per cent of young people feel that adults listen to their needs and concerns, 79 per cent feel safe in
community, and 77 per cent feel no concern when interacting with people from different cultures and
beliefs.

Graph 3 illustrates that 63 per cent of youth now trust local authorities, 79 per cent of the young
people feel confident when interacting with local authorities, and 51 per cent feel that their voices
heard when dealing with local authorities.
Graph 4 which shows that 95 per cent of young people think that the best way to address a conflict
situation is through dialogue, 93 per cent of young people are willing to speak up when someone is
violent in the community, and 74 per cent of young people disagree with the statement, “My
community assumes that young people may use violence to solve problems”.
Figure 6. Sense of belonging of young people to community
Figure 7. Confidence of young people in the state
Figure 8. Violence related behaviors and beliefs among young people
60
The questionnaire results show that young people built positive relationships and networks at the
community level, gained confidence in the state, cope well with diversity, and strongly disagree with
violence related behaviors and beliefs. These results suggest that the project may have, to some extent, positively
affected the young people as they are less supportive of violence related behaviors and beliefs.
The results from the guided questionnaire were triangulated with the analysis from the interviews to
provide with an in-depth understanding of the behavioral changes.135 There is evidence that the
approach—combining civic empowerment (individual level), civic engagement (institutional level) and
community dialogue (family/community level)—had a positive impact on resilience to violence, thus
validating the main assumption of the project. For instance, a young person interviewed reported
increasing his critical thinking skills so that he could filter better incoming messages. He also reported
that his parents were now more willing to listen to his needs because of project activities. He said that
he is now more comfortable using communication and dialogue to resolve issues at home and in his
community.136
The evaluation team observed no indirect or unintended impacts or results related to peacebuilding
or the prevention of violent extremism. However, the project did some have some results that were
not foreseen at conception stage. For example, UN Women encouraged many groups of women to
produce and distribute more than 2000 face mask in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (see finding
13 below).
135 It is important to note that after the guided questionnaire those 43 youth were also interviewed to gather more in-depth information on the project
and its impact on them
136 It is too early to verify all the results of the project at the community level. The project has had a solid impact at the individual level also in terms of
resilience to violence. However, it is not possible for this evaluation to evaluate the resilience towards violence at community level.
61
Efficiency
4. Main questions: How efficient was the project in using its resources to achieve its objectives?
Sub questions:
4.1 Have funds and activities related to the selected initiatives been delivered in a timely and resource appropriate
manner?
4.2 To what extent was the governance set-up appropriate to achieve results in terms of:
‣ Guidance from the Steering Committee?
‣ Cooperation among supporting and implementing partners?
4.3 To what extent were the monitoring mechanisms in place effective in measuring and informing management of
the project performance and progress towards the targets?
This section addresses the main question and sub-questions related to the efficiency criterion. Finding
13 shows how project efficiency was overall solid despite the COVID-19 pandemic, which was
leveraged as an opportunity for greater impact. Finding 14 shows that, despite some overall
appreciation of its role, the joint steering committee (JSC) did not play the strategic role it was designed
for. Finding 15 shows that there was willingness to properly follow the progress of the project and
measure its results, but this did not translate into an effective monitoring, evaluation and learning
system.
Finding 13: Overall efficiency of the project is solid, as activities were implemented in a timely
and resource appropriate manner despite the COVID-19 pandemic. The project leveraged the
pandemic for stronger impact.
Triangulation of information
• Desk review of project document (financial reports, annual and semiannual reports)
• Interviews with UN staff
• FGDs
• …
The project reached a 100 per cent implementation rate, and most line items were close to the planned
expenditure. Not surprisingly, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, most activities at the project had
to be postponed. This led to an extension of the whole project, which was finally implemented over
42 months. However, this evaluation found that despite the pandemic, the project managed its
resources appropriately and implemented all its activities while achieving its objectives.
The project adapted to COVID-19 pandemic challenges through non-monetary and monetary
adjustments in ways that made the crisis an opportunity. Firstly, the project conducted several of its
activities137 virtually, resulting in lower costs. Secondly, there is anecdotal evidence that project was
amplified as more participants attended project activities as the project went online. For instance, one
137 For example, UN Women provided courses to improve IT skills and on communication tools for the target women.
62
of the interviewees stated that he was able to participate in the project activities such as UPSHIFT
even though he was not part of the initial cohort that was supposed to be conducted in-person.138
The project adjusted some of its activities to the new and more pressing health challenges caused by
the pandemic. For instance, the project helped women to take active role in pandemic response by
helping 36 women and girls sew 2,000 face masks and give them to their community members,
especially the most vulnerable families. One woman used the skills she had developed through the
Small-Scale Initiatives (SSI) element of the project to identify vulnerable women and girls for
humanitarian aid support. She also helped UN Women distribute hygiene kits in communities.
Table 3. Adjustments to the project made as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic
• As an immediate response to COVID-19, more than 320 of the most vulnerable women in 11 PVE target
communities across the country received hygiene kits as humanitarian aid. Hygiene kits included cleansing
wipes, reusable face masks, essential hygiene items, liquid soap, sanitizers and detergent. These kits gave
women and girls the opportunity to use their limited funds to purchase other vital resources.
• Women targeted in this project were forefront of the response to the COVID-19 crisis in their communities.
Thirty-six women implemented initiatives in sewing, making and distributing more than 2000 face masks to
their community members and healthcare workers. Moreover, women conducted information and
awareness raising campaigns against the spread of COVID in their communities, participated in disinfecting
streets and volunteered in day care centers. Women distributed humanitarian aid and participated in other
decision-making initiatives on crisis response in 12 project localities.
• The community participatory research with youth and adolescents from May to July was moved to online
mode because of the high infection rate at that time. Youth bootcamp workshops for developing solutions
to issues previously identified were moved to September and October.
• The stakeholders’ round table on civic education was conducted online, where the lessons learned from the
project and the results achieved were revealed.
The project also made some adjustments to strengthen its efficiency and respond to unexpected
circumstances. For example, the implementation of civic education in secondary schools was delayed
by the MoES selection of a new textbook proposal for Grade 7 on “Human and Society” and the
MoES delay in calling for proposals by the start of the school year in September 2019. The project
responded to this uncertainty about implementation of this activity by cancelling the activity and
reallocating the funds to support the MoES in a full gender-sensitive and non-discrimination review
of education materials and tools.139
This evaluation found that reporting could have been improved to better articulate the efficiency of
the project throughout implementation. For instance, the annual and semi-annual reports only
138 Also, indicator 1.3.2 141 young people (77% girls), that were reached out online during COVID, were able to proposed solutions to issues of
mental health, domestic violence.
139 Only a few stakeholders interviewed highlighted that sometimes the rigidity of the UN system makes it difficult to make changes and adjustments
when needed. This is in line with a recent evaluation that states that ‘L&A strategies only make sense when implementing partners have the possibility
to make ad hoc changes during the implementation. And yet, many agencies’ internal procedures do not allow for adaptations after the projects have
been logged into their internal systems. If L&A strategies are only partially applied, agencies are missing important opportunities for joint learning,
conflict sensitive reality checks, and inter-agency cooperation. This also shows that once PBF projects have been approved and the money has been
transferred to RUNOs, the PBF has limited influence on the implementation process.” (Kyrgyzstan Strategic Review 2020, p. 21)

mentioned “the implementation rate as percentage of total project budget” without better specifying
elements that the evaluation team found in separate documents related to the budget of the project.
The project also could have better explained the implementation problems and the possible solutions.
Finding 14: Despite some overall appreciation of its role, the steering committee did not play
a strategic role it was designed to do
Triangulation of information
• Desk review of project document (annual and semiannual reports)
• Interviews with UN staff
• …
Interviews conducted with agencies and NGOs during the evaluation showed that project
implementers expressed appreciation for JSC guidance. The JSC was composed of 28 individuals
representing Government, civil society and development partners. It was co-chaired by the Head of
the Department for Interethnic Relations and Collaboration and the Civil Society of the President and
the UN Resident Coordinator.
However, this evaluation found that the JSC was used to validate some decisions already taken by the
project rather than acting as a platform to discuss strategic direction, progress, challenges, and possible
solutions140. This is confirmed by the initiatives taken by the UN RC and the PBF secretariat to closely
follow the project progress and organize field monitoring visits that should have been, in principle,
organized by the JSC.141 Also, JSC coordination of project stakeholders was rather limited. As
discussed in the coherence section, collaboration initiatives were undertaken more by some of the
stakeholders (UNRC) than the JSC.
The stakeholders interviewed emphasized some of the limitations of the JSC, including frequent
changes in government and limited capacities of members. Also, the lack of PBF strategic framework
at the portfolio or country level, already mentioned in this report, was highlighted as a potential
constraint. A well-articulated and clear strategic framework would facilitate the work of the JSC as the
guidance of the latter would also be based on a long-term vision.
Finding 15: There was willingness to properly follow project progress and measure results.
However, there were some challenges with the monitoring and evaluation system.
140 As mentioned above, there is also little evidence that the project interacted with other agencies involved in the implementation of the other
outcomes (1 and 2) of the PPP, which the JSC could have facilitated
141 According to the project document ‘JSC is also a relevant platform for development actors to coordinate their interventions. As a part of their
monitoring and oversight they also undertake field trips to project sites providing feedback as well as contributing to sustainability of the results and
local ownership over them.
64
Triangulation of information
• Desk review of project document (including annual and semiannual reports, good practices on
M&E)
• Interviews with UN staff
• FGDs with UN staff and implementing partners
New PBF strategy has clearly committed to making learning a component of monitoring and
evaluation.
The evaluation found that there was a strong commitment at project conception to make M&E a
crucial part of the activities. The project document mentioned that approximately 7 percent of the
total budget will be allocated to M&E, which is in line with good practices on establishing M&E at
project level. The project also foresaw the establishment of baseline assessment to identify targets.
Finally, the project envisaged that the JSC and the agencies would carry out monitoring activities in a
systematic manner.
The evidence collected by the evaluation only partially validated the accomplishment of the planned
M&E. Project stakeholders followed up on their initial commitment by conducting some specific
monitoring activities. Desk review and interviews confirmed that agencies deployed their own
monitoring instruments such as pre and post-test questionnaires to measure the results of the project.
The L&A142 exercise also helped the agencies to better understand the chain of results of the project
and, under the guidance of UNFPA, more fully articulate the TOC and Result Framework.143
There is also evidence that the project adapted some of its activities because of the monitoring actions
it undertook. For instance, the localized analysis produced some recommendations for expanding
community dialogues over PVE issues and a need for multi-media products to meet the project’s
public awareness goals. In addition, during its monitoring visits, the PBF secretariat identified some
issues and challenges that were highlighted to strengthen the project.
However, the evaluation found the following obstacles144 for the project’s monitoring and learning:
● VE and radicalization are difficult to define and measure145. As mentioned in the relevance
section, there is an ongoing discussion on these terms as this is an emerging field of study.
• The difficulty of measuring such concepts was exacerbated by the absence of a strategic
peacebuilding framework at the portfolio/country level. This made it difficult to measure
142 The Learning and Adaptation workshops that were facilitated by the PeaceNexus Foundation helped to identify risks, to develop mitigation strategies,
and to share expertise and strengthen coordination. It needs to be pointed out, though, that while the workshops were attended by most RUNOs follow-
up actions were undertaken with sporadic success and consistency.
143 It should be mentioned however that the evaluation team did not receive this document and thus could not review it
144 (it should be mentioned that some of those obstacles are within the control of the project and some outside its control)
145 There are significant research gaps in the development of indicators or measures of community resilience relating to violent extremism, especially
those that can create understanding of why people don’t turn to violent extremism, rather than on why they do. More work is needed in particular on
identifying the preventive and protective factors at work in community resilience contexts, with detailed assessment of their multi-level systemic
processes. The absence of a standardized measure addressing these domains currently limits the efforts of communities and agencies to develop effective
and meaningful youth-focused policies and programs that can identify both what young people in communities already possess as resilience resources
(but which may be unrecognized or under-utilized), and what vulnerabilities or gaps they may need to address, and how.
(Grossman et al., 2016).
65
higher-level results of impact, such as a sense of belonging in the community, at country level
beyond specific projects.146 The PPP logframe is a collection of the 3 logframes, not an
integrated logframe for higher-level results
● The project did not have a baseline or an end-line for measuring its outcome indicators. The
logframe of the project was, therefore, only partially completed. There was also some
terminology confusion between outcomes and outputs. For instance, the workplan for PVE
outcome 3 refers to the different components as outcome 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 whereas the project
document refers to them as output 1.1., 1.2, and 1.3
● As mentioned earlier in this report, the project did not articulate the TOC and clarify all
assumptions that should be monitored during implementation. Thus, it is impossible to verify
whether the project indicators coincide with the TOC of the project
● The focus on good reporting and knowledge management could have been improved. The
evaluation found that the structure of the reporting and its contents does not allow a clear
understand of the project progress, challenges, tested solutions, or learning process. Interviews
with project stakeholders confirm this problem, highlighting that they were not always up to
date on the progress of the project or its main obstacles.
The evaluation on the L&A approach states that the different culture of learning of each agency can,
at times, hamper the process of measuring learning from results. According to this evaluation, the
culture of learning is different among the agencies, as some organizations are more open to new
approaches than others. UN officials across agencies differed in their understanding of "what, why
and how" in the L&A approach.147
Sustainability
Main question: To what extent are initiatives supported by the project likely to be sustained over time so as
contribute to peacebuilding?
Sub question:
5.1 How effectively has the project generated national ownership and capacity to continue implementation of the
results achieved?
5.2 How likely is it that youth and communities will sustain the results of the project after its end?
This section addresses the main question and sub-questions related to sustainability. Finding 16 is that
there are already encouraging early signs of sustainability. Finding 17 is that more effort and time is
required to foster community resilience to withstand violent extremist ideologies.
Finding 16: There are encouraging early signs of sustainability related to inclusion of young
women, including vulnerable women, and men’s needs into community development, civic
education and engagement.

The project’s expectation was that the government, at national and local levels, would integrate
youths’, including women’s and girls’, needs and concerns into their development plans and strategies.
The project reported that the needs of the young people and women were integrated into current
socio-economic development plans of the pilot communities. The project succeeded in supporting
the development of child and youth friendly plans and committing funds within YCFLG initiative in
18 towns. However, as shared by the project implementing partner, while there is a legislation in place
for participatory development of socio-econоmic plans148, in practice the local self-government bodies
(municipalities, and local council deputies) have limited capacity to work out quality plans. This is due
to factors such as low capacity, staff turn-over, lack of institutional capacity. Often these plans are
elaborated formally. The existing practice of development of socio-economic programs for cities and
villages (aiyl aimaks) is aimed to a greater extent at solving infrastructural problems within the existing
budgets. At the same time, local governments do not pay due attention to local community
development or the proper identification of community needs. Existing development programs rely
to primarily on funding from the scarce local budget. Resources of potential development partners
usually remain unused. Modest local budgets and general problems of regional economic development
are long-lasting issues requiring systematic solutions.
This project heavily relied on the implementing partner capacity and experience. The RUNOs have
cooperated on several projects with some implementing partners149 with crosscutting agendas. The
project implementing partner DPI has been supporting the local governments to improve the work
with population at the local level for many years, with support of various development partners. Based
on the experience, DPI (with UNICEF support) elaborated a guide based on the experience, including
the experience of the Child and Youth Friendly Municipalities Project carried out jointly with
UNICEF in Kyrgyzstan since 2017. The goal of the project was to adapt and implement the Child
and Youth Friendly Kyrgyzstan initiative in 32 urban and rural municipalities of Kyrgyzstan and as
part of the current project. LSG staff, leaders, and young members of local communities, including
children and adolescents, were able to improve knowledge about the specific needs of adolescents and
young people, especially regarding access to local services. They received skills and tools for planning
and implementing local development policies in the interests of adolescents and youth. Piloting has
resulted in working development plans that meet the needs, requirements and rights of children and
young people. Local authorities often welcome any support to local development, and they displayed
a strong commitment to continued cooperation with the projects. However, without external support,
local budget scarcities could jeopardize the sustainability of youth initiatives or limit opportunities for
youth.
The project faced obstacles to promoting quality dialogue between LSGs, and youth from resistance
of some of the local governments to shift their methods and mindsets to the approach the project was
suggested. They demonstrated some resistance to integrating the needs of the “awakened” youth.
Interviews with evaluation participants identified three causes for this. First, local government used to
engage youth only in one-time events such as annual sport events. Second, the “government doesn’t
have money to carry out activities, such as community meetings, because they require additional
financial expenses.” The third factor was lack of coordination between stakeholders.
148 Based on Degree No 194 of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic dated 31.03.2017 on the Concept of the Regional Policy 2018-2022, the
Ministry of Economy (joint order with the Stage Agency of local self-governance) approved Methodological Recommendations for the local self-
government bodies for development of socio-economic plans (Order No 63-A dated 15.05.2018).
149 A particular CSOs could partner with UN agencies on several projects, e.g. IDEA CA, Youth of Osh were also partners for “Promoting
Kyrgyzstan’s youth cohesion and interaction towards Uzbekistan” implemented by UNICEF, UNDP, UNFPA.
67
However, the guided questionnaire revealed that more that 60 percent of youth trust local authorities,
whereas the rest were neutral or untrusting. Some young adults interviewed expressed encountering
difficulties with local governments while implementing the project initiatives, because the local
government did not offer support or showed mistrust of young people.
Quote:
“I became a leader. I manage my team successfully. We had obstacles from the side of local government. I remember
I searched 3 days for a list of children with disabilities from the local government. It referred those who did not
have any disability, but the children from the list was from vulnerable families, so I had to walk door-to-door to
find our target group.”
At the same time, local governments are willing to cooperate on future projects and support youth
initiatives. For example, many interviewed adults (parents, teachers, religious leaders) agree on the
need to continue working to counter violent extremism through civic education, engagement and
dialogue. Around 90 percent of the people interviewed acknowledged that improving civic
competencies and establishing dialogue between LSGs, youth and community members can help solve
community issues.
The role of educational institutions in promoting civic education was more prominent. Adoption of
non-discrimination and gender sensitive approaches in textbook publication, civic education
curriculum, competencies development and methodological papers in support of civic competences
development for teachers have ongoing effects. However, there is a need to deliver further technical
assistance to the MoES and its agencies to spread these concepts in education practice.
Finding 17: More time and effort is required to foster community resilience to withstand
violent extremist ideologies.
As mentioned above, the project succeeded in building civic competencies of the targeted young
people and empowering them at an individual level. The project also facilitated collaboration between
police, teachers, parents, government officials, community leaders and religious leaders. The project
showed that different actors could have roles to play in countering violent extremism. However, more
time and a systemic approach is required to build community resilience to violent ideologies. The
project tested different approaches and created positive precedents, such interaction with religious
leader, civic education in madrasahs. But there is not enough evidence for these initiatives and
interactions to continue without external support and facilitation. To have a greater impact at
community level a successor project should be implemented to allow more strategic prioritization,
more time, resources and, most importantly, strategic prioritization, time, and resources.
The evaluation found that most stakeholders want to develop follow-up projects. Most of the
stakeholders interviewed highlighted that projects like this are important for their communities and
Kyrgyzstan, and they showed their desire for a follow-up project. Young people and their parents said
they gained enormous number of benefits. One of the teachers interviewed said that school students
formed a waiting list of candidates among 8th-11th grade students who want to be engaged in projects
that are implemented in their school and/or community. Vulnerable women explained their desire for
follow-up projects as they feel they do not receive enough support. Those who participated in small-
grant initiatives, were not able to fully realize their goals because of short-term support and lack of
68
further skills to overcome difficulties they faced. For example, interviews with some vulnerable
women revealed that their small-scale sewing businesses had to stop because lack of a rented
workshop.
Quote:
I am not able to earn as planned, because I could not find a place to rent to launch my workshop. Now I keep
my sewing machines at home and receive little orders (interview with woman from vulnerable groups).
I got necessary equipment, and I am grateful. But I realized I don’t have skills to sell my products. I wish I could
learn about it within the project, too (interview with woman from vulnerable groups).
The project helped many participated beneficiaries, especially vulnerable women to gain self-esteem
and claim their rights. However, many women do not yet have the confidence to fully enjoy their
rights and withstand all forms of violence and discrimination in their communities.
X. Conclusions and Lessons Learned
Conclusions
The project “Communities Resilient to Violent Ideologies”, funded by the UN PBF and implemented
by UNICEF, UNFPA, and UN Women, was a multi-agency effort to build community resilience to
violent and manipulative ideologies through civic education, empowerment and dialogue in the target
municipalities across Kyrgyzstan. The project used an integrated approach to resilience to violence
that proved effective despite implementation under challenging circumstances, including the COVID-
19 pandemic. There is solid evidence that the project had a positive impact by empowering youth and
women and strengthening youth resilience to violence. Some of the results of the project, however,
would need follow-up to be sustained.
The evaluation found that the project was highly relevant as its design was embedded in a solid
understanding of the context and youth empowerment, despite difficulty, especially at the beginning
of the project, with conceptualizing VE. The project development considered the needs of the final
beneficiaries of the project, especially vulnerable groups and women. Among its beneficiaries, the
project also targeted adults, teachers, community members, as it correctly assumed that youth are
influenced by them, so a full-fledged youth empowerment project should include them.
Based on the analysis of some of the root causes of VE, the project devised an integrated approach
including civic education, civic empowerment and community dialogue. It targeted individuals,
institutions and families/communities to strengthen resistance to harm and increase youth resilience.
The project was designed and implemented building on the comparative advantage of each UN
agency. However, the project could have more clearly defined the roles and responsibilities of each
agency and complied more closely with the UN guidance note on joint programs. While the project
was able to clearly map complementary projects at the design stage, there is little evidence that the
project built on those complementary projects during implementation.
69
Despite the difficult circumstances created by the pandemic, there is solid evidence not only that the
project positively empowered youth and other beneficiaries, but that the integrated approach proved
effective in strengthening resilience to violence. The evaluation can validate most of the logical
pathways and assumptions identified in the reconstructed TOC: empowering youth and other main
beneficiaries, strengthening their trust in government and developing a sense of belonging in the
community/family can have a positive impact on their resilience to violence. The lack of a solid MEL
(Monitoring, evaluation and learning), evidenced by the lack of baseline, end-line, and articulated
TOC, prevented fully showing the results and impact of the project activities. This shortcoming is
exacerbated by the absence of a PBF strategic framework, which could define longer-term results and
the complementary contributions of parallel peacebuilding projects.
The project institutionalized part of their results, such as the integration of the gender non-
discriminatory filter into the civic education component and the integration of youth priority into
municipal plans. However, some of the results of the project will need more support for sustainability.
Sustaining project results requires further support from the government and CSOs, including
additional resources, time and effort.
Lessons learned
Program design: The achievement of results and the smooth implementation of projects relies on
the quality of the project design. Spending enough time and effort to develop a solid and coherent
project can have multiple benefits during implementation.
TOC: Developing a solid TOC is key to make the project more coherent and to communicate project
goals effectively with the stakeholders and the public. The TOC logical pathways and assumptions
needs to be clearly articulated, and a visual representation needs to be developed at the beginning of
the project through a workshop with the project team.
Peacebuilding, flexibility and learning: In a country such as Kyrgyzstan, it is of utmost importance
to develop projects that are flexible and adaptable to unexpected circumstances, such as a change of
government. This is related to the project’s MEL system. Learning should be at the core of
peacebuilding projects so that teams can continuously see progress and identify, anticipate and
overcome problems. Learning needs to be a daily activity of project teams.
PBF and innovation: The project was innovative in its approach. Evaluations of PBF funded
projects have shown that this was the case elsewhere as well. PBF has proven able to finance pilot
projects to be scaled up by the government or other donors. However, the option for the PBF is either
to continue financing short term projects as complementary components of long-term projects or to
develop longer term projects.
Peacebuilding and VE: Projects that deal with VE or, more generally, with peacebuilding related
issues should clearly define those concepts at conception stage. This benefits the development of the
TOC and communication on what the project is trying to achieve.
Peacebuilding and youth empowerment: There is a growing literature on the relationship between
peacebuilding and youth empowerment. The project under review was able to show that a direct
70
connection might be established. It is important to better explain this relationship when developing
the project.
Literature on peacebuilding and conflict analysis: Project development should build on the
growing literature on peacebuilding and evaluation. Identifying specific methodologies and indicators
when developing the logframe could result in better analysis.
Impact and duration: Strengthening vertical or horizontal trust, as in the case of this project, takes
time, and it is difficult to show concrete results in a span of two years. The option could be to either
develop longer term projects or develop a strategic framework (five years) that could then fund shorter
projects, with realistic and complementary indicators.
Trust building: Future peacebuilding projects should increasingly consider trust building as an
objective or cross-cutting theme. However, projects need to consider that trust building is a long-term
endeavor and that it is not possible to develop it and measure it in a short timeframe.
Also, it should be important for the project to either focus on vertical or on horizontal trust building
as merging the two may add unnecessary complexity.
Sustainability: It is of utmost importance for peacebuilding projects to develop a sustainability
strategy from the beginning of their design. Those strategies should seek, to the extent possible, to
empower local beneficiaries, including national and local institutions, to take over activities of the
project when it ends.
XI. Recommendations
The recommendations below provide specific suggestions for each intended user and were discussed
and validated in three steps:
• a Focus Group Discussion with eight UN staff was held in November 2021 to better
understand their feasibility.
• The Evaluation Reference Group meeting was held on the 15th of December 2021to present
the final report and discuss the recommendations.
• Upon completion of the first draft of the final report, RUNO staff and the Evaluation
Reference Group commented on the content and structure of the recommendations.
The specific roles in developing the recommendations of the project stakeholders (duty bearers, the
rights holder, project partners) included:
• Individual critical reflection: discussing possible recommendations and feedback during the
interviews with duty bearers, right holders, and project partners
• Group critical reflection: discussion of the recommendations within ERG, RUNO
The recommendations are presented in order of priority for each intended user.
71
PBSO
1. The PBF should continue supporting youth empowerment projects that have proven
to be effective around VE. It should formalize the development of a longer strategic
framework that can represent the foundation of the youth empowerment projects.
The PBF should continue to support Kyrgyzstan in strengthening PVE mechanisms with projects
that focus on preventive measures against PVE. The integrated approach150 has proven effective as a
model, producing concrete results on youth resilience to violence. The project created momentum
around youth empowerment and resilience to violence that should be followed-up on (see also
Recommendation 5). The expectation from the government is that they would receive support to
continue or scale up some project results.151 It is important to define a strategic framework, based on
examples in Guatemala and the Balkans, at the portfolio and/or country level based on the new five-
year eligibility process. New peacebuilding projects funded by PBF will be then based on the new
strategic framework.
Operational recommendations:
• PBF should consider the following options to follow-up on the project evaluation: either fund
a new project developed by RUNOs or help RUNOs ensure the sustainability of specific
project activities with additional funds (see Recommendation 5).
• The PBF should formalize the development of a strategic framework focusing on
peacebuilding for longer-term results. It should finance a series of projects that can even have
a shorter time horizon but that can complement each other and have a direct impact on the
longer-term objectives.
• The strategic framework should have a solid M&E framework for the overall period that can
be unpacked to show main outcomes, other projects contributing to those objectives and UN
agency roles.
Overarching long-term Main outcomes and Projects contributing to UN Agency involved
objectives outputs those objectives
• The PBF should consider conducting impact evaluation of PBF initiatives at the
portfolio/country level to better identify the longer-term results of PBF-funded initiatives.
2. The PBF should build on its existing platforms to strengthen knowledge management and
facilitate exchange of information among countries that receive peacebuilding funds
The PBF has a Community of Practice that encourages the exchange of experiences through different
platforms. The PBF should develop a system for country teams to exchange good practices and learn
150 A combination between civic education, civic empowerment and community dialogue
151 For instance, concerning civic education components there is a series of important activities that should be developed so as to follow up with
project activities, among which, Integration of civic competencies in the existing discipline ‘Legal basis of professional activity’; the subject ‘Civic
education’ within the ‘Legal basis of professional activity’ curriculum should be taught based on the guide produced by the project partners, as agreed
with the national authorities, based on the decision of the RSMC
72
from each other. In addition, the PBF should help country teams to identify complementary projects
to build synergy and maximize impact.
The PBF’s ultimate objective is to ensure that ‘learning’ is happening, and UN agencies can learn from
the design and implementation of the projects on peacebuilding.
Operational recommendations:
• Building on its website, the PBF should develop a database of good practices and lessons
learned from peacebuilding operations, highlighting the contributing and hampering factors
for achieving results. It should also consider implementing specific key learning events around
peacebuilding, building on the findings from the Synthesis Reviews, the Thematic Review(s)
and other relevant reviews.
When thinking about “knowledge exchange” and learning, the PBF should focus on joint
programming. It is important for the PBF to distill lessons learned from joint projects on
peacebuilding to help country teams decide the nature and extent of their collaboration (see
Recommendation 7).
• The PBF should consider helping country teams develop partnerships by mapping
peacebuilding interventions from different actors supporting peacebuilding in the country.
• The PBF should revise the structure of the semi-annual and annual reports to promote
learning. For instance, it should add sections in the report for “challenges and problems” and
“innovative solutions”152. It should also add a section on financials, such as disbursement rates
and budget figures (budget planned vs. disbursed), to the semi-annual and annual reports.
PBF secretariat
3. The PBF secretariat should consider helping country follow PBF guidance and
strengthening the capacity of country teams to develop peacebuilding projects.
Representing ‘a bridge’ between PBF headquarters and the RUNOs, the PBF secretariat has a unique
opportunity to help country teams apply the guidance PBF has developed. The guidance produced by
the PBF on issues like TOC is clear, but teams need support in fully complying.
The PBF secretariat could also facilitate knowledge exchange between agencies, as in the case of the
L&A for the project evaluated.
Operational recommendations:
• The PBF secretariat should motivate and mobilize UN staff to apply the guidance notes when
developing the CN. There should be coherence between the guidance notes and the CN
templates. The PBF should find innovative ways to facilitate the reading of the guidance notes
by, for instance, making short videos on how to develop a structured TOC.
• In collaboration with the UNRC, the PBF secretariat should also help UN agencies interact
and exchange knowledge when developing and implementing joint projects. The secretariat
should make the L&A approach an important part of its agenda so that agencies can prioritize
learning as part of their activities
152 An interesting example is the ‘Learning and Adaptation Plan of Action’ that includes the following sections: a) Progress (What has been done)
b) If there is no progress, explain why.
73
UN Resident Coordinator Office
4. The UNRCO should continue providing guidance on how to address complex
concepts such as VE.
The UNRCO played an important role in the project under review. The UNRCO should help RUNOs
consider context when designing projects by ensuring that conflict analysis has been adequately
conducted. In principle, the UNRCO could help RUNOs develop a understanding among
implementing agencies and government counterparts on the scope of project concepts like PVE, social
cohesion, cross-border cooperation, and women’s empowerment.
Operational recommendations
• The UNRCO should ensure that peacebuilding programs and projects are embedded in solid
conflict analysis that meet validated international criteria.
• In collaboration with the PBF secretariat, the UNRCO should help UN agencies exchange
knowledge on good practices for peacebuilding.
RUNOs
5. The RUNOs should continue focusing on youth empowerment and peacebuilding
around VE through an integrated approach, while including peacebuilding in their
regular programs and investing in skill development on peacebuilding.
As mentioned under the recommendation 1, the momentum around the project should be seized and
RUNOs should continue focusing on issues related to youth empowerment around VE. The project
approach has proven effective in addressing some of the causes of VE.
Above all, RUNOs should integrate peacebuilding into their programs following the example of
UNICEF.153 It will also be important to consider increasing agencies’ level of technical expertise in
peacebuilding as it is necessary for building strong peacebuilding programs.
Operational recommendations
• RUNOs should consider developing peacebuilding projects around VE by continuing to use
an integrated approach applied by the project under review.
● RUNOs should anchor their peacebuilding approach in the broader strategic planning and
programming architecture of country offices by including peacebuilding outcomes in the CPD
and their strategies.
● When designing new peacebuilding projects, RUNOs should define difficult concepts such as
VE into the project document, in collaboration with the UNRC office, based on good
practices and the growing literature on the subject. RUNOs should consider strengthening
their technical expertise in peacebuilding, in collaboration with the PBF by attending online
courses or in-presence training.
153 New UNICEF country strategy includes peacebuilding as a cross-cutting theme
74
6. RUNOs should strengthen MEL systems to make learning one of the priorities when
developing and implementing peacebuilding projects.
Learning should become a central part of peacebuilding projects, and the agencies should incorporate
it in project activities. When dealing with complex issues such as VE and radicalization (whose
definitions is still not agreed upon), it is key to learn from project activities and adapt quickly.
Learning should be integrated into existing processes gradually as be part of the M&E system, not
categorized as a separate activity. The M&E system should be viewed more broadly then just the
development of a simple logframe. It should include the development of an articulated TOC, with a
solid logframe and an articulated monitoring table, the definition of responsibilities, a clarification of
the information flow, and an explanation of how learning would happen throughout the project and
how it will inform programmatic decisions on changes.
Given that the smooth implementation of projects is based on the quality of project design and its
M&E framework, RUNOs should spend extra resources at program conception stage to ensure a
high-quality design.
Operational recommendations:
• The RUNOs should clarify the logic behind the TOC pathways, underlying assumptions and
objectives. The TOC should include a visualization of the logical connections and underlying
assumptions154. The TOC should clearly show all the underlying assumptions that are clearly
illustrated, tested and refined as necessary during implementation.
• Based on the TOC M&E frameworks, RUNOs should:
o Develop SMART indicators and data collection tools that facilitate the attribution to
the activities of the project.
o Develop specific tools or mechanisms to capture the catalytic role of the project. They
should use qualitative methodologies, such as the ‘outcome mapping’, that empower
beneficiaries to collect the data themselves and show changes in the observed
behavior.
o Develop a digital platform that captures progress against the indicators and major
reflections and changes during implementation.
o Develop a M&E system and workplan that allow flexibility on revising the indicators,
as needed.155 Develop a solid RF/logframe and related workplan while allowing
flexibility to revise activities, indicators or budget items during implementation.
• RUNOs should gradually integrate learning into project activities. This could be done by
adding a specific section on the reporting templates on learning related to the problems the
projects faced and the solutions devised to address those problems. This could be also done,
lightly, by asking a series of systematic questions during the formal meetings agencies hold
such as: what did we learn about the problem we are trying to face? What are learning about
the way in which we collaborate?
154 Also, the TOC should be a “living product” that the project team should continuously verify to see whether the causal connections are proven and
whether the assumptions hold true – this would be a way to slightly revise the approach of the project, if need be.
155 For inspiration, see the “search framework” from Harvard University, the Objectives and Key Results from Google or the Rapid Results Approach
75
‘Light events’ specifically on learning would give UN agencies and the main stakeholder some
space for reflection.
7. When conducting joint projects, RUNOs should clarify the roles, responsibilities, and
level of collaboration they seek.
Different options and scenarios should be carefully considered before deciding which governance
structure and collaboration activity to envisage. The UN guidance on joint projects is rather broad and
there are different options RUNOs can envisage when developing joint projects. These include a range
from designing projects where agencies jointly collaborate within each project output/component and
where they have therefore many joint activities, to designing projects where each agency works on one
output/component with only some limited collaboration and exchange of information. The evaluation
showed that a better clarification of roles at the beginning would have benefited collaboration.
Operational recommendations:
● RUNOs should better specify the nature of collaboration they envisage within joint programs
based on the project objectives, budget, country context, agencies involved and based on the
UN joint programming guidance. They should justify the extent to which they will collaborate,
such as how many joint activities they intend to develop, at conception stage.
● RUNOs should consider the development of a ‘responsibility matrix’, at proposal stage and
finalize before starting implementation, to clarify comparative advantages and the specific
tasks of each agency in the project document.
● RUNOS should articulate a joint workplan, including a description of the inputs needed to
carry out the activities and the budget for completing those activities.
● RUNOs should learn from other joint programs about the governance structure they used,
the type of activities they developed, etc. (see Recommendation 1)
8. When developing peacebuilding projects, RUNOs should develop solid partnerships
with complementary projects by identifying them at conception stage, building on
synergies, interacting during implementation and documenting this in progress
reports.
Finding synergies with complementary projects starts at conception stage and should be followed up
with knowledge exchange throughout implementation. This helps avoid duplication and build on good
practices and lessons learned from complementary projects. The project under review identified
complementary project at conception stage but did not document how it built on these synergies
during implementation. This documentation would facilitate attracting additional donor support for
follow-up peacebuilding work or new projects.
Operational recommendations:
● RUNOs should, at the project design and implementation stages, ensure that proper synergies
are sought with partners and donors that have developed complementary projects.
76
● RUNOs should ensure that learning about complementary projects and synergy development
is happening. During implementation, agencies should document how complementary
projects affect synergies or adjustments.
Government
9. Government should build on the results of the project to ensure sustainability.
In connection with recommendation 1 and 5, the government should take ownership of the results of
the project, some of which have already been institutionalized, and ensure that a proper follow-up is
considered. As mentioned above, RUNOs could support the government in implementing some of
those recommendations through, for instance, UNICEF expertise on education, technical assistance
and training.
Operational recommendations:
Around civic education, the government should:
o Consider the integration of civic competencies in the existing discipline ‘Legal basis of
professional activity’ and ensure that the curriculum is taught based on the guide
produced by the project partners, as agreed with the national authorities.
o Maintain the quality and continuous education process in vocational schools, by
increasing the capacity of teachers on digital skills and new technologies for distance
learning, and creating infrastructure conditions for distance learning. The government
should also strengthen students’ digital skills so that they can take advantage of
distance learning opportunities.
o Consider integrating civic education with the "Concept of State Policy of the Kyrgyz
Republic in the Religious Sphere" for the period 2021-2026.
o Consider integrating the civic education guide, workbook, video courses and mobile
application into the curriculum in the remaining 96 madrasas, 10 Islamic institutes and
the Islamic University.

Evaluation Reference Group:
“Communities resilient to violent ideologies” project
Background
The project "Communities resilient to violent ideologies" implemented by UNICEF, UNFPA, UN Women
contributes to UN’s Peacebuilding Priority Plan for 2017-2020 on diverting people from joining to groups propagating
for violence by means of community participation, dialogue and education.
The project aims to provide alternative pathways away from violent and manipulative ideologies in 11 pilot
municipalities across the country by taking a multidimensional approach through education, participatory community
development and dialogue, as well as through the cultural domain and digital space. The Agencies provide civic
competencies to young people and women within secular and religious schooling thus empowering them to participate
in addressing issues that cause vulnerability to violent ideologies. People from different social backgrounds and
professional affiliations are identified and supported in their actions as credible intermediaries between the vulnerable
groups and the state actors. They facilitate greater communication between these groups and raise awareness about
the risk of violent ideologies, thus strengthening capacities for social cohesion. The project helps strengthening
platforms to promote constructive debate around diverse identities as an alternative to divisive ideologies.
The project is divided into the following three components:
• Civic education for secondary and vocation schools and religious schools, also referred as madrasahs provides young
people with context and critical thinking skills to examine messages brought by instigators and proponents of violence.
In addition to legal and institutional foundations of the state and society, civic education is designed to promote
attitudes of tolerance, inclusion, and diversity with a specific focus on gender equality.
• Youth and Child-Friendly Local Ggovernance (YCFLG) is meant to provide young people an opportunity to improve
their civic competencies in real life situations. The project facilitates collaborative action of youth, local governments
and community leadership in addressing issues that matter to them. YCFLG contributes to youth’s participation sense
of belonging to their communities, a critical component of social cohesion.
• Encouraging young women and men to claim their rights, to lead and participate in community development will be
the key strategy for reducing vulnerability to violent ideology. This is meant to strengthen their sense of community
identity and provide a space where they can fulfil their potential and realize capacity. The main assumption behind the
activities in this component is that the women (including female religious leaders) are in a better position to warn
about worrying signs of radicalization amongst members of their community, and can be powerful and effective agents
of support for those who are vulnerable to reach out for help.
Evaluation purpose and objectives
Conducting a summative final evaluation of the project is one of key requirements under the monitoring and
evaluation provision of the project. The main objective of this summative evaluation is to generate findings, lessons
learned and recommendations regarding the relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efficiency, impact and sustainability
of the project results and to assess what has worked and what has not, the circumstances influencing achievement and
the challenges that hindered it.
Evaluation management
The evaluation will be a consultative, inclusive and participatory process. The evaluation will be managed by the
UNICEF Kyrgyzstan Country Office (CO) as a leading agency. Support will be sought from UNICEF Europe and
Central Asia (ECA) Regional Evaluation Specialist. The Evaluation Reference Group (ERG) and Evaluation
Management Team (EMT), a separate group consisting of technical staff, will be involved throughout the evaluation
93
process. Peacebuilding Support Office (PBSO) will also participate by providing comments and approval of the
Inception Report and Final Report.
UNICEF Child Rights Monitoring (CRM) Specialist is the Evaluation Manager and will lead the day-to-day
management of the process and will consult with and involve the Evaluation Management team regarding key issues.
To avoid conflict of interest the Evaluation Manager cannot have direct involvement/responsibilities in the
management of the program.
Function and composition and of the Evaluation Reference Group
An Evaluation Reference Group will be set up as a consultative body to the evaluation. The purpose of the ERG will
be to facilitate the participation of relevant stakeholders in the design and scope of the evaluation, raising awareness
of the different information needs, providing information quality assurance throughout the process and in supporting
the dissemination of the evaluation results.
The process aims to ensure participation of stakeholders at all stages, with a particular emphasis on rights holders and
their representatives. Data collection and analysis for the program includes conducting consultations and interviews
with stakeholders, including with representatives of relevant national and local government institutions, CSOs, UN
Agencies, beneficiaries of the program and development partners. The participation of key stakeholders to inform
this evaluation is key for ensuring relevant inputs to inform the entire evaluation process.
The inputs of ERG are expected to strengthen the quality and credibility of the evaluation. The ERG members will
be expected to:
• Help to identify and facilitate access to materials for desk review and key informants during the evaluation process;
• Participate in inception interviews with evaluators as relevant;
• Attend a presentation of the inception report and share comments on the inception report during the presentation
(date TBC);
• Participate in follow up interviews with evaluators as relevant;
• Attend presentation of preliminary key findings from desk review and field work and provide comments during the
presentation;
• Attend presentation of the final report and verify findings and recommendations during the presentation.

1. Purpose of the study. This study is being conducted by an evaluation team composed of three evaluators, hired by UNICEF office
in Kyrgyzstan, in order to better understand how UNICEF/UNDP/UN Women has promoted Kyrgyzstan's youth civic engagement
and what improvements are needed for future. In addition, we seek to understand how UNICEF/UNDP/UN Women have worked
with each other and with international donors and local organizations in function of building communities resilient to violent
ideologies. This research will contribute to broader knowledge about the present situation in relation to conflicts and the role of UN
agencies and other stakeholders in building community resilience to violent ideologies through the means of education, empowerment
and dialogue.
2. Description of the procedures to be followed and approximate duration of the evaluation.
a) For national and provincial authorities, CSOs and municipal service providers in interviews:
We will spend approximately 45 minutes with you, in which we will ask you a series of questions about: your organization’s work (),
how it has evolved over the course of project, its relationship with other groups engaged in conflict prevention, and your own
personal experience working in the context of the project. If you accept, the interview will be conducted without recording, but the
interviewer will take verbatim notes on computer. These notes will only be shared within the research team, stored safely until the
end of the research, and deleted at the end. You will not be quoted by name or in any identifiable fashion.
b) For CSOs in focus group discussions:
We will spend approximately 1,5 hours with you, in which we will ask you a series of questions about: the project and your experiences
with UN agencies involvement in this, the outcomes of the project for your institution and for your service users, as well as potential
improvements which you deem necessary in the future. If you accept, the focus group discussion will be conducted without recording,
but the research team will take verbatim notes on computer. These notes will only be shared within the research team, stored safely
until the end of the research, and deleted at the end. You will not be quoted by name or in any identifiable fashion. The focus group
discussions are subject to Chatham House Rules: by agreeing to participate, you and the other participants at the same time commit
not to share the inputs of the discussion participants once exiting the room.
3. Description of how confidentiality will be assured and the limits to these assurances, if any. All data collected will be stored
on a password-protected secure server, to which only project team members will have access. You will not be individually identified,
information you provide will be attributed to an anonymous source. Transcribed interviews do not include any traceable, sensitive
information. To preserve anonymity, these documents will not contain any links to you directly.
4. Anticipated benefits resulting from this evaluation.
A. For national and provincial duty bearers, CSOs and municipal service providers representatives in interview or focus group discussions: The potential
benefits to you from participating in the evaluation are to gain insights as to how to collaborate with other organizations more
effectively as well as donor governments and other external partners to address violent extremism issues.

Procedures and due diligence concerning informed consent
The team will respect the obligations of evaluators (the UNEG Ethical Guidelines, 2008): independence, impartiality, credibility, the
avoidance of conflicts of interest, honesty and integrity, and accountability. The evaluators declare no conflict of interest.
Informed consent will be sought from all participants. The evaluation team will explain to the participants the purpose and use
of the evaluation. The evaluation participants will be informed fully about 1) the aims of the evaluation and the
background/composition of the evaluation team, 2) why they are invited to participate in the evaluation, and 3) what the benefits of
the evaluation would be.
The team will make clear to participants that the participation in the process of evaluation is voluntary and should they wish to, they
will be free to opt out of the discussion or interview at any point. It will be important to emphasise ethical considerations of
confidentiality, power relations and informed consent. Consent should be an ongoing process, and (as far as applicable) anonymity
should be adhered to. In addition, no gifts or other rewards will be presented to respondents so as not to influence consent. The
statements of informed consent from those involved in the process of evaluation and providing information for the evaluator will be
obtained.
Interested interviewees will be given a written Informed Consent form to read and keep, and another to sign, if agreed to. Interviewees
who come to CSO or UN premises will be handed a printed copy to sign by staff or mentors, who will also explain the evaluation
process and the consent form in a simple Kyrgyz/Uzbek language to the participants, and answer their questions. Mentors/staff will
print the Informed Consent forms twice per interviewee: one to be signed and collected, one to be kept by the interviewees. They will
also provide support in obtaining parental consent. Mentors/staff know the parents and already have experience of getting written
permissions from them for project activities. As the mentors will not be present during the interviews, the risks of influence or fear of
consequences via their mediation can be excluded.
Interviewees who do not need the mediation nor premises to participate will be asked to sign the consent form digitally (e.g. signing
manually and sending a scan/a picture of the signed document taken from their phone, or signing with their digitalized signature in
PDF – whatever they find most convenient).
Signed consent forms will be collected, either on paper by project staff or project partners, or digitally by the evaluation team, and
provided to UNICEF for safekeeping. UNICEF will follow its rules for protection of data, its storage and destruction. The evaluation
team will not record identifiers – the views and opinions expressed in the interviews will not be attributed to individual participants.
The interviews will involve adults and minors between 14 and 18 years old. In the case of minors, the consent of a legal guardian is
obligatory, as well as the consent of the child
The evaluators will ensure confidentiality of information, privacy and anonymity of study participants. Confidentiality and anonymity
guarantees will be made to those providing information for the evaluation. The participants of the evaluation will be clearly informed
111
of the confidentiality measures: their contributions will be aggregated and anonymized in the report, and their responses will be kept
confidential. The final report will not have reference to any names. While the final evaluation report may include quotes which are
representative of widespread opinions expressed by the interviewees, they will be screened by the evaluation team members to check
they are not attributable. During interviews and focus groups, the evaluation participants will be asked permission so that the evaluators
may take notes from interviews and discussions. The evaluation consultants will explain that detailed notes taking will assure the
accuracy of the data. All interview notes will be kept within the evaluation team only (not forwarded to any other actor, even UN
agencies), stored in a password-protected drive during the evaluation, and completely deleted upon completion of the evaluation.
Since the evaluation will explore people’s attitudes towards ethnic diversity, particular attention will be paid to allowing stakeholders
to express both positive and negative feedback, while averting the (re)ignition of possible frustrations or painful memories. The team
members have extensive experience in empathic interviewing, and are also keenly aware of the inter-ethnic situation locally, which will
enable them to minimize this risk.

The evaluation team members will also stress that participation is
voluntary and the subject can refuse to participate at any time of
the process (p 69)
3.5 In event of any of the above risks, do protocols describe clear Please discuss potential psychological risk and its mitigation. X
strategies to mitigate risks? Examples of triggers could be: recent memories related to gender-
based violence such as early marriage may emerge in discussion
about empowerment, perception of inequity in access to services
and resources when describing relation to duty bearers, parent and
child relations (especially girls) related to decisions of the future of
the child, e.g about early marriages (for girls), education,
participating at extracurricular activities.
Strategies to address triggers:
-when contacting a participant before the interview and at the
beginning of the interview, restate that the participant is free to stop
at any time of the interview without any personal disadvantage.
-anticipate possible experience of any tensions according to several
factors (age, community
characteristics) and be on the alert for early signs of discomfort or
distress.
124
- If triggers arise: practice non-judgmental active listening.
Communicate that feelings and emotions are legitimate. Ask what
such projects can do to help defuse tensions in the future, or
alleviate the consequences of past tensions (forward-looking
attitude)
-indicate to the participant where s/he can discuss these
experiences and get support (phone number/ association, provided
by UNICEF or other actors)
3.6 Does the study request information or opinions where public X
disclosure may result in danger, limitations to
future freedoms, or access to services?
3.7 Do gender, ethnicity, or other demographic characteristics -- or X
grouping of subjects by any of these characteristics, especially in
FGDs -- increase subject
risk?
3.8 If a subject discloses or is suspected to be at risk outside the study, Please describe. X
are procedures in place to address or report risk and refer subject Report amended on p. 69: “If an evaluation participant discloses or

acknowledge the risk, and address this by reporting the risk to the
project team, and appropriately referring the subject for relevant
support, specific to the situation at hand (e.g. providing the phone
number of a specialized association, police, local service provider).”
