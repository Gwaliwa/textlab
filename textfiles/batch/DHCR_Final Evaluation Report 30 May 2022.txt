GLOSSARY
Key Terms of Evaluation
Before-after Involves measuring the dependent variable both before and after the participants have been exposed to the
independent variable.1
Child Protection UNICEF uses the term ‘child protection’ to refer to preventing and responding to violence, exploitation and abuse
against children—including commercial sexual exploitation, trafficking, child labour and harmful traditional
practices, such as female genital mutilation/cutting and child marriage.2
Contribution Contribution analysis explores attribution through assessing the contribution a programme is making to observed
analysis results.3
Early Childhood ECD is defined as the period from conception up to school entry. It is a unique window of opportunity for children’s
Development cognitive, social, emotional and physical development, which occurs as the result of the interaction between the
environment and the child.4
Endline Quantitative (descriptive statistics) and qualitative (inferential statistics) information about the situation or condition
after the intervention/programme / project is completed. It must ideally be done using the same set of tools and
with the same group of beneficiaries.
Global Evaluation The GEROS system consists of systematic and independent quality assessment of evaluation reports that have
Reports Oversight been uploaded to the corporate Evidence Information Systems Integration database (EISI) by UNICEF Country
System (GEROS) Offices, Regional Offices, HQ divisions and Evaluation Office. The purpose of the Global Evaluation Reports
Oversight System (GEROS) is to support and strengthen the evaluation function to meet and exceed United
Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) standards, UN System Wide Action Plan on gender equality (UN-SWAP) and
other UNICEF commitments (including equity and human-rights based approaches).5
Human Rights A human rights-based approach is a conceptual framework for the process of human development that is
based Approach normatively based on international human rights standards and operationally directed to promoting and
protecting human rights.6
Mixed Method A procedure for collecting, analysing, and ‘mixing’ both quantitative and qualitative research and methods in a
single study to understand a research problem.7
OECD DAC The OECD DAC Network on Development Evaluation (EvalNet) has defined six evaluation criteria—relevance,
Criteria coherence, effectiveness, efficiency, impact and sustainability—and two principles for their use. These criteria are
intended to guide evaluations.8
Participatory Participatory evaluation is an approach that involves the stakeholders of a programme or policy in the evaluation
Evaluation process. This involvement can occur at any stage of the evaluation process, from the evaluation design to the data
collection and analysis, and the reporting of the study.9
Stunting Stunting refers to low height of a child compared to age. It is an indicator of chronic undernutrition and is caused
by inadequate intake of nutritious food, frequent illnesses such as diarrhoea and intestinal worms, poor care
practices, and lack of access to health and other essential services, especially in the first 1,000 days of a child’s
life but with potential effects lasting a lifetime.10
Summative Summative evaluations are usually conducted at the end of an intervention and should produce objectively
Evaluations verifiable information on project / programme effectiveness. Such an evaluation involves the use of quantitative
methods and looks at the realisation of committed outcomes or the likelihood of those materialising. Any
unintended consequences of the intervention and lessons learnt are identified and highlighted.11
WASH WASH is the collective term for Water, Sanitation and Hygiene. Due to their interdependent nature, these three
core issues are grouped together to represent a growing sector. While each is a separate field of work, they are
dependent on the presence of the others. For example, without toilets, water sources become contaminated;
without clean water, basic hygiene practices are not possible.12 All three areas in WASH support and strengthen
one another. If one is missing, the others cannot progress.

Endline Evaluation of the Developing Human Capital in Rwanda Programme (DHCR) i
Executive Summary
This is the final evaluation report of the Developing Human Capital in Rwanda programme
(henceforth referred to as DHCR or the Programme), supported by the United Nations Children’s Fund
(UNICEF), Rwanda Country Office (RCO). The DHCR Programme aimed to: increase human capital
development in 14 districts of Rwanda by establishing optimal conditions for children (aged 0-6 years)
to achieve their full potential and build a strong foundation to develop into adolescents with key problem-
solving and socio-emotional competencies. The Programme’s implementation was led by the
Government of Rwanda (GoR) represented by: Ministry of Health (MINISANTE); Ministry of Gender
and Family Promotion (MIGEPROF); Ministry of Local Government (MINALOC); and Ministry of
Agriculture and Animal Resources (MINAGRI). AAN Associates, (a Pakistan-based research and
evaluation consulting firm) implemented the evaluation between September 2021 and May 2022.
Intervention Context: Rwanda is a country with a population of 12.9 million people (2020). Rwanda
has made important economic and structural reforms and recorded strong economic growth over the
past two decades. The impact of COVID-19 (with subsequent lockdown and social distancing
measures) sharply curtailed economic activities in 2020, causing the country’s gross domestic product
(GDP) to drop by 0.2 percent in 2020 compared to a projected expansion of 8 percent before the
COVID-19 outbreak.13 The country has a high stunting rate of 33 percent according to Demographic
Health Survey (DHS 2019-2020), which is higher than the average for the Africa region (30.7 percent).14
The bottlenecks that prevent children from reaching their full developmental potential include
inadequate dietary intake (as only one in six children enjoys all recommended feeding practices);
repeated infection; inadequate psychosocial stimulation (parents engaged in activities that stimulate a
child’s development and early learning); and lack of opportunities for optimal child development.15
Object of Evaluation: UNICEF RCO has supported the GoR to model and scale up integrated
approaches to delivery of programmes addressing the needs and rights of young children in Rwanda.
DHCR is driven by the intent to identify and address the cross-sectoral issues that affect children’s
holistic development in Rwanda. The design features a multi-sectoral and integrated approach, to
address both immediate and underlying causes affecting the attainment of optimal child growth and
development. The focus is on systems strengthening through multiple strategies i.e., capacity-building;
behaviour-change communication; and coordination for integrated services at central, decentralized
and community levels. Programme implementation followed a hybrid approach featuring collaboration
between multiple stakeholders including public agencies, private sector, and civil society organizations
(CSOs). DHCR was implemented between 2017 and 2022 (initially planned until 2020) in 14 districts.
The total budget was US$27 million funded by the Embassy of Kingdom of the Netherlands (EKN).
Purpose and Scope of Evaluation: This is a Summative Evaluation, with an expressed purpose to
better understand how and under what conditions the interventions and activities were implemented
under DHCR; and to assess the extent to which the initiative has met its objectives and achieved the
desired results. The results from this evaluation will inform decisions by the GoR to scale up and
continue implementation of similar approaches, including adjustments needed. The evaluation scope
includes all EKN-funded Programme activities implemented from 2017 to 2021 in 14 targeted districts,
i.e., Nyamagabe, Ngororero, Rutsiro, Gakenke, Burera, Rubavu, Nyaruguru, Karongi, Gicumbi,
Nyamasheke, Gatsibo, Rusizi, Nyagatare and Musanze.
Evaluation Design, Methodology and Limitations: The overarching design include Mixed Methods16
and Participatory17 approaches. Keeping in view the intervention design and evaluation expectations,
the evaluation team applied a Hybrid Evaluation Design, featuring Contribution Analysis18 and
Comparative Analysis19 (with ‘Before-After’20 sub-design). The evaluation had to drop the quasi-
experimental design (or data collection from control districts) for contamination risks due to similar
interventions (by other actors) in control districts. Evaluation methodology included a household (HH)
survey (sample size of 1,352 households with a mother or female caregiver as respondent)

16 Mixed Methods research design is a procedure for collecting, analysing, and ‘mixing’ both quantitative and qualitative research and methods in a single
study to understand a research problem.
17 Participatory evaluation is an approach that involves the stakeholders of a programme or policy in the evaluation process. This involvement can occur
at any stage of the evaluation process, from the evaluation design to the data collection and analysis and the reporting of the study.
18 Contribution analysis explores attribution by assessing the contribution a programme makes to observed results.
(https://www.betterevaluation.org/en/plan/approach/participatory_evaluation).
19 Comparative analysis is the process of comparing items to one another and distinguishing their similarities and differences.
20 Before-after design involves measuring the dependent variable before and after the participants have been exposed to the independent variables (taken
from FAO Marketing Research and Information Systems – Chapter 6).
Endline Evaluation of the Developing Human Capital in Rwanda Programme (DHCR) i
implemented in seven districts (Nyaruguru, Karongi, Rutsiro, Ngororero, Burera, Gicumbi and Gatsibo).
The endline survey followed the same methodology and design as the programme baseline (carried out
in 2019) for comparison purposes. Qualitative data was gathered through 30 focus group discussions
(FGDs) (including 139 male and 154 female participants) with mothers, fathers, community health
workers, farmers and community influencers. The evaluation team conducted 39 key informant
interviews (KIIs) with stakeholders including UNICEF RCO, relevant public ministries, implementing
partners (IPs) and donors. Desk review of 77 internal and external documents was undertaken to inform
and corroborate the primary data. Evaluation design methods and implementation placed a considered
focus on the integration of human rights-based programming, gender equality and equity by developing
separate evaluation questions, tools, analysis and findings section for three cross-cutting programming
priorities (treated as non-DAC criteria). Limitations of the evaluation include: data constraints that
prevented comprehensive efficiency and effectiveness analysis (missing information on targets and
programme progress from April – December 2021); majority of HHs that participated in the baseline
study were ineligible to participate in the endline study which were replaced with other households
within the same communities; and safety risks posed by COVID-19 leading to hybrid data collection
modality (remote and in-person).
Evaluation Findings & Conclusions: Key findings against DAC and non-DAC criteria are given below:
Relevance: The findings indicate alignment between DHCR outcomes and strategies with those of
national and development partners policies and plans (for the nutrition and early childhood development
(ECD) sectors), which validates the Programme’s relevance. Ample evidence is available to suggest
an inclusive process featuring extensive consultations, joint reviews, validation meetings and bilateral
meetings with key stakeholders was followed to involve them in design. There is evidence of changes
in the context and beneficiary needs due to several factors (including government restructuring,
changes in policy mandates and COVID-19), but limited evidence is available to show if or how the
Programme made design level adjustments in terms of changes in the results framework and budget.
Relevance is evident as the Programme used both primary and secondary data (including the 2019
baseline, capacity gap analysis, ethnographic study) to deepen understanding of needs, barriers,
drivers, and local dynamics, and used this data to inform the programme design. The selection of
programme districts is driven by a multi-factor vulnerability assessment, which adds further to DHCR’s
relevance in terms of targeting the most impoverished and under-developed districts and communities.
Programme design (strategies/interventions) are appropriate for addressing both the demand and
supply-side barriers to malnourishment and development delays such as: capacity-building (of both
duty-bearers and rights-holders); dialogue and advocacy (for uptake of promoted behaviour and
practices); public-private partnership (for linkages with businesses and ECD centres); and evidence
generation (for effective decision-making).
Coherence: The findings indicate that during programme design, UNICEF RCO managed to leverage
internal coherence by engaging multiple UNICEF’s sections. This enabled designing an intervention
that aimed to address the causative elements behind stunting in children under 5 (U5) and holistic child
development. The evaluation did not find significant evidence around how internal integration
(resources and strengths across sections) was leveraged through implementation, and merits better
documentation.
The Programme took a systematic approach to map and leverage external complementarities across
stakeholders. This was achieved through multiple processes e.g., i) conducting studies to map
stakeholders and interventions to have holistic view of actors and interventions; ii) collaborative
consultations during the proposal stage to ensure there is no duplication of efforts; iii) partnering with
relevant government and private entities to design and implement DHCR interventions; iv) use of
existing platforms (the National Child Development Agency (NCDA), Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN)
network, national ECD sub-cluster, child development technical working group) to coordinate,
collaborate, plan and reflect with other development partners and relevant government agencies to
implement DHCR activities, whilst avoiding duplication and overlap. This contributed to engaging with
and utilising sector/cross sectoral forums.
Effectiveness: The effectiveness measurement remains incomplete, hence inconclusive for the fact
that out of seven outcomes, only three could be rated for relative effectiveness (for having sufficient
information to rate outcomes on the scale). For four outcomes i.e., 1 (nutrition), 3 (water, sanitation and
hygiene (WASH)), 6 (integrated multisectoral interventions), and 7 (private sector linkages), either data
or targets are unavailable to compare performance data. Out of the remaining three outcomes, two
outcomes on social protection (outcome 4) and education (outcome 5) are assessed as ‘Fully Achieved’
Endline Evaluation of the Developing Human Capital in Rwanda Programme (DHCR) ii
and one outcome (i.e., ECD – outcome 2) is rated as ‘Mostly Achieved’.21 From the achievement data
on programme components i.e., nutrition, health, ECD, WASH, and social protection, where the
evaluation team has compared the baseline (2019) with endline data (2022) for 46 indicators (across
seven districts), the evaluation concludes that the Programme was ‘Partially Effective’. Out of 46
indicators, the evaluation found incremental change in 28 indicators (61 percent) covering mostly the
WASH and health components. There are 18 indicators (39 percent of total) where the evaluation noted
declining trends. The plausible explanation is COVID-19 and its impact on incomes, poverty and
restricted mobility, however, merits further exploration. The key enablers for the Programme are:
alignment with GoR priorities resulting in ownership and commitment of public sector partners; use of
community-based models (community-driven) resulting in community engagement and ownership;
adaptive measures taken during COVID-19. The disabling factors that hindered achievements include
institutional changes (NECDP becoming NCDA); frequent public sector staff turnover (in districts); and
COVID-19 disruptions and restrictions.
The Programme is largely a success in strengthening public sector nutrition and ECD systems, and
packaging as integrated services. As part of system strengthening efforts, DHCR appears to be
relatively more successful (or effective) with respect to two elements (out of five) of Enabling
Environment22 i.e., policy and strategy (supported GoR to develop multiple policies and strategies) and
monitoring and evaluation (supported GoR to conduct national surveys and improve nutritional
governance). The Programme remained partially successful for others i.e., capacity-building
(undermined by high staff turnover reported at the district level); financing and budgeting (for limited
focus and visible results around this component) and institutional arrangements and coordination
(stakeholders reported gaps in district level coordination).
The community capacity development is assessed with respect to community mobilization and linkages
development; skills and knowledge development; materials assistance; and monitoring and social
accountability. The Programme successes are evident in organizing communities (for collective
actions); wider community participation and engagement; leveraging influence of local influencers, i.e.,
religious leaders, theatres, faith-based organizations; and provision of skills and supplies. All these
factors contributed to cultivating ownership and mobilizing community for collective benefit.
Efficiency: The evaluation team is unable to draw conclusions on the Programme’s efficiency due to
unavailability of performance data from March to December 2021. The Programme reached to 8.5
million beneficiaries against a target of 0.5 million (the number hints to double counting of beneficiaries
reached out by different interventions). In addition, the number was reached while using only 79 percent
of allocated funds. As a result, it seems that the Programme set lower targets in comparison to the
resources available. Given the Programme’s focus on nutrition and ECD, the allocation of over 55
percent of resources to these two components justifies the allocation of resources. The average per
beneficiary cost comes at $2.05 for the Programme which is lesser than the planned cost/beneficiary
($2.65). The cost comparison between EKN 123 ($2.15) and EKN II ($2.05) underlines EKN II was as
cost efficient as EKN I (in terms of cost/beneficiary).
Impact: The Programme has two impact indicators (reduction in stunting and improvement in child
holistic development). The national stunting numbers indicate reduction from 38 percent to 33 percent
(from 2015-2020) which equals the Programme’s intended target of achieving 5 percent reduction in
stunting nationally. This measurement is for national level whereas the Programme was implemented
in 14 of the 30 districts and it may have contributed to the observed change. For Programme districts
however, the numbers show a reduction of 1.6 percent (in 7 out of 14 Programme districts – for 6-23
months children) between 2019-2022. The lower results for Programme districts (in comparison to
national numbers) beg further enquiry. For holistic development, the national numbers have increased
from 63 percent (DHS 2014-2015, among children 36-59 months) to 76 percent (DHS 2019-2020,
among 24-59 months). However, comparison between these two values is not possible due to variation
in age groups between the two surveys. For programme districts, the comparison remains incomplete
(for all indicators that make up the holistic development) between the baseline (2019) and endline
(2022), however for most of these indicators there is an upward trend in uptake of early stimulation
activities. The unintended impact is evident in terms of improvement in fathers’ involvement in child
development activities including shift in behaviour to save money rather than using money for personal
expenses.
21 The evaluation team applied a rating scale where ‘Mostly Achieved’ means 61-90% of intended targets achieved whereas ‘Fully Achieved’ means 91-100%
of intended targets achieved.

23 The DHCR Programme (known as EKN II) is a second phase of an earlier project funded by the EKN Kigali, known as the ‘EKN Phase I. Phase 1 was
implemented from 2014-2017 in 10 districts and focused on nutrition-specific interventions.
Endline Evaluation of the Developing Human Capital in Rwanda Programme (DHCR) iii
Sustainability: The Programme operated without a documented Sustainability/Exit Plan; and as a
result, the evaluation team is unable to comment on success around its implementation. From the data,
it appears that programme strategies of evidence generation (with availability of requisite data for future
interventions) and public-private partnerships (PPP) (commitment by private companies to continue
supporting ECD centres) show higher prospects of sustainability. Whereas strategies such as capacity-
building, dialogue and advocacy, and cross-sectoral linkages are relatively less likely to be sustainable
due to continued need for implementation. There is evident interest and willingness in the GoR agencies
to continue and replicate the Programme which have translated into securing additional public sector
financial contribution for components including nutrition, ECD and social protection. Initiatives by UN
agencies and World Bank also highlight the development partners commitment to continue supporting
GoR in reducing stunting and improving child holistic development in Rwanda.
Non-DAC
HRBA: Programme design and implementation is found largely consistent with HRBA principles. The
consistency with the principle of participation is evident at varied levels such as engagement of right-
holders, duty-bearers and influencers. The Programme is consistent with local laws and international
rights conventions and has empowered rights-holders by enabling access to knowledge leading to
perceived sense of empowerment in community members for better food, health and child nurturing
choices. The Programme is found to be largely non-discriminatory with the exception of some families
who were excluded from programme services for not meeting the desired Ubudehe criteria/rating. The
Programme missed out on developing/supporting a feedback and grievance management system for
accountability.
Gender Equality: The Programme is found to be partially compliant to gender equality principles. The
Programme design offers limited gender disaggregation, as no indicators call for collection of gender
disaggregated data (stunting and child development of girls and boys). Moreover, Programme design
was not informed by formal gender assessment but utilised secondary evidence to inform its design.
Programme implementation is assessed as gender responsive, as both male and female community
members were sensitised on promoted behaviour; gender-segregated toilets were built in schools to
address the needs of women and girls; female participation in committees and capacity-building
initiatives; ECD centres set up by tea companies to promote work-life balance (women could work
without having to worry about children). Results from the evaluation endline survey underscore that the
prevalence of stunting in children aged 6-23 months though decreased, still continues to be higher for
boys than girls in seven targeted districts (21.6 percent (boys) and 19.4 percent (girls) in 2022).
Equity: The Programme is found to be mostly compliant with equity principles. The Programme’s
geographical targeting was based on equity parameters including prevalence of stunting, poverty rates,
household food insecurity and access to improved drinking water and improved sanitation and
leveraged existing data to understand equity related needs and barriers and design interventions
accordingly. Mostly, the interventions remained non-discriminatory; however, beneficiary prioritisation
was done on the basis of Ubudehe (categorisation), but community discussions indicate the targeting
was sometimes incorrect and in some cases deserving HHs did not receive benefits. More interventions
are needed for people with disabilities and teenage mothers and their children also were not prioritized
for the interventions.
Conclusions, Lessons Learnt and Recommendations
Conclusions on the Way Forward
The Programme has been largely successful in creating momentum as is evident from contributions to
intended impact. There is evident public sector willingness to continue implementation which has
translated into increased public sector financial contribution to DHCR components. Still, the situation
merits continued engagement of UNICEF RCO with GoR, possibly in a different role. For UNICEF the
focus must shift to policy advocacy and development of a medium to long term road map,
documentation of good practices, successes and business cases. The GoR must continue to allocate
public financial allocations to DHCR interventions. The private sector holds the key and GoR must find
ways to stimulate corporate social responsibility (CSR) and incentivise businesses (through tax breaks
and other incentives) to become partners in delivery social goods. The GoR must continue working with
external stakeholders to leverage their presence and resources and strengthen community engagement
mechanisms including local coordination to sustain interest and ownership of other actors including
communities. These ideas have been crystallised into actions in the recommendations.
Lessons Learnt
The Programme contributed to useful lessons and good practices as outlined below.
Endline Evaluation of the Developing Human Capital in Rwanda Programme (DHCR) iv
1. The wider consultative process evolved and applied for programme design and rollout (with
active engagement of public and non-public stakeholders) was identified as a good practice that
enabled cultivating broader ownership and merits continuation.
2. The use of a systematic approach to map stakeholders (through multiple exercises) and
leverage information for improved external coherence has proven useful and effective and merits
continuation.
3. The Programme has been effective in private sector/businesses engagement for creating social
impact/public good and business continuity. The engagement with tea companies and
cooperatives proved to be a win-win relationship, which should continue and be expanded to
other sectors.
Recommendations
Find below evaluation recommendations framed whilst keeping in view that the Programme has come
to a close. Key recommendations have been included here, for more details, refer to Chapter 5:
GoR:
1. Seek technical assistance to undertake a broader review of national nutrition and ECD policies
and to translate policy frameworks in a Child Development Road Map (for the next 5-10 years),
which should leverage the structures and systems.
2. Undertake an extensive stock-taking exercise whilst using the enabling environment framework
to map the systemic strengths and gaps and use the assessment to inform both the roadmap
formulation and put measures in place for continuity of interventions.
3. Seek technical assistance to document the interventions, forums, and successes to make a case
for additional public financial allocations whilst demonstrating results.
4. The Programme has proven the benefits of community engagement approaches for demand
creation and cultivating local ownership and traction. The future must leverage pledges by local
community leaders/warriors.
5. Work with businesses and cooperatives where mostly mothers are engaged in implementing
workable public-private partnership models, offering a win-win equation for everyone involved.
6. The GoR may undertake assessment of systems/services with the lens of equity, human rights,
and GE, with the view to integrate them into future nutrition and ECD services.
UNICEF:
1. Remain engaged with GoR and extend technical assistance with above mentioned actions (for
GoR) such as policy reviews and revisions, sector stocktaking exercise/s, formulation of stunting
reduction and child holistic development roadmaps, documentation of business cases and
successes of DHCR, and facilitating donor and GoR engagement for continuity.
2. Assess the current level of documentation around processes, systems, standards, sector
coordination, monitoring and evaluation (to guide GoR-led implementation) and identify need for
additional documentation to enable GoR to be able to deliver quality services.
3. Continue to use the documentation—business cases, successes and others, for policy advocacy
with GoR to prioritise nutrition and ECD interventions and increase public allocations for relevant
public sector entities.
4. For future similar interventions, at the design stage, set realistic impact targets and use district-
based targets rather than overall targets, whilst keeping in view the contextual variations in terms
of baseline, risk exposure, and overall level of development. In addition, commission exploratory
studies to understand the district-specific context which may explain the increase in stunting in
some of the target districts.
5. The budgeting process for similar future interventions must link costs to results/outcomes.
Moreover, planning should include development of a realistic budget as DHCR planned versus
utilised costs were lower for all outcomes
6. Document the best practices around creating win-win partnerships between private and public
sector. Use the documentation for wider advocacy around greater engagement of the private
sector in public services delivery.
7. Advocate for and support greater integration of equity, human rights and GE into future nutrition
and ECD services.

Evaluation
Endline Evaluation of the Developing Human Capital in Rwanda (DHCR) Programme 1
Chapter 1: Introduction and Object of the Evaluation
This is the final report of the Summative Evaluation of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF),
Rwanda Country Office (RCO) supported flagship intervention named: Developing Human Capital in
Rwanda (henceforth referred to as DHCR or the Programme). The Programme aimed to increase
human capital development in Rwanda by establishing optimal conditions for children (aged 0-6 years)
to achieve their full potential and build a strong foundation to develop into adolescents with key problem-
solving and socio-emotional competencies. The DHCR was implemented from 2017 to 2021 in 14
districts24 and with funding from one primary donor—the Embassy of the Kingdom of Netherlands
(EKN). The Programme’s implementation was led by the Government of Rwanda (GoR) represented
by: Ministry of Health (MINISANTE); Ministry of Gender and Family Promotion (MIGEPROF); Ministry
of Local Government (MINALOC); and Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources (MINAGRI).
AAN Associates (a Pakistan-based evaluation firm) was commissioned to design and implement the
evaluation from September 2021 to May 2022. The evaluation followed the objectives and scope as
listed in the evaluation Terms of Reference (ToR, attached as Appendix 1). However, the evaluation
methodology was slightly modified in view of the partial lockdown imposed by the GoR due to the
COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, a hybrid data collection model (remote and in-person) was
implemented for key informant interviews (KII) and focus group discussions (FGD) to comply with local
administrative regulations. All changes related to evaluation methodology and timeline were discussed
and agreed with UNICEF Rwanda in advance.
The report follows UNICEF’s Global Evaluation Reports Oversight System (GEROS)25 guidelines for
an evaluation report. The structure of the report is outlined below:
• Chapter 1: Presents the intervention context and the intervention itself, i.e., programme or object
of the evaluation.
• Chapter 2: Offers an overview of the evaluation’s purpose, objectives, scope, roles (of
stakeholders), uses and significance.
• Chapter 3: Explains evaluation design, methodology, quality assurance, ethical considerations,
evaluation management and implementation arrangements.
• Chapter 4: Outlines the evaluation’s findings, analysis and preliminary conclusions.
• Chapter 5: Presents evaluation conclusions, outlines lessons learnt and gives recommendations.
• Appendices: Includes all relevant supporting material for this evaluation report.
1.1 Intervention Context
This section provides a brief overview of the country and the context of the intervention (early childhood
development (ECD) and stunting) at global, regional and country levels. Refer to Appendix 2 for a more
detailed analysis.
Global Context: ECD refers to the process of a young child acquiring essential motor, cognitive, social,
emotional and language skills.26 Children who do not receive adequate health, nutrition, early
stimulation, learning opportunities, and care and protection tend to have lowered cognitive, language
and psychosocial outcomes which translate to lowered academic achievement. Around 40 percent
(350 million) of children below primary school entry age need childcare, but do not have access to it.27
Stunting (low height-for-age) is an indicator of chronic undernutrition. Globally, undernutrition remains
a key factor in 35% of child deaths and irreversibly impairs the physical and mental development of
children leading to a 10% reduction in lifetime earnings and up to 8% reduction in gross domestic
product (GDP) in high burden countries. The underlying reasons for stunting and low child development
are similar across regions and countries including poverty, conflict and displacement, inadequate
infant and young child feeding practices and disabilities, among others.28
Regional Context: In the Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA) region, ECD and nutrition are an integral
part of countries’ sectoral policies and strategic frameworks. Despite this progress, there are evident
gaps in implementing these policies and frameworks, including lack of i) detailed financing strategies;
ii) multi-sectoral coordination mechanisms; and iii) accountability structures for services delivered.29

education. Stunting (a proxy for the incidence of developmental delays) has declined from 46 percent
in 2000 to 32 percent in 2020.30 There are still considerable challenges such as lack of funding,
proper budget allocation, and lack of technical expertise and robust monitoring systems from
the GoR.
Country Context: Rwanda is a country of 12.9 million people (2020), with a population that is 49.1
percent male and 50.8 percent female.31 The country’s surface area covers 26,340 sq. km32 divided
into five provinces (Northern, Southern, Eastern, Western and the Municipality of Kigali), 30 districts,
416 sectors, 2,148 cells, and 14,837 villages.33 The official languages are Kinyarwanda (spoken by
most Rwandans), English, French and Swahili.34 A strong focus on homegrown policies and initiatives
contributed to significant improvement in access to services and human development indicators.
Growth averaged 7.2 percent in the decade before 2019.35 According to the national poverty line,
poverty declined from 77 percent in 2001 to 38 percent in 2016. Moreover, life expectancy at birth
improved from 33 years (1990s) to 69 (2019).36 The impact of COVID-19 (with subsequent lockdown
and social distancing measures critical to controlling the pandemic) sharply curtailed economic activities
in 2020, resulting in the country’s gross domestic product contracting by 0.2 percent, i.e., 10.3 billion37
in 2020 compared to a projected expansion of 8 percent before the COVID-19 outbreak.38
Despite improvement in development and economic growth, Rwanda continues to face some significant
challenges, particularly pertaining to the first critical years of children’s lives. In 2015, 38 percent of
children (under five) were stunted, which has fallen to 33 percent by 2019-2020. The high prevalence
of stunting and children not reaching their full developmental potential is due to the combined effects of
inadequate dietary intake (as only one in six children enjoys all recommended feeding
practices), insufficient nutrition intake of pregnant and lactating women, repeated infection,
inadequate psychosocial stimulation, and a lack of opportunities for optimal child development
(Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey (RDHS) 2019-2020).39
Policy Framework around ECD: As a signatory to the global and regional frameworks such as the
United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UN CRC),40 Education for All (EFA),41
Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and standards on the child’s rights, Rwanda is committed to
improving ECD services for children aged 0-6. In this regard, the country has put in place several
policies and strategies to tackle challenges related to ECD, for instance, the National ECD Policy42 sets
the conditions to develop community led integrated ECD programmes and strengthen and coordinate
essential inter-sectoral and sectoral services for children and parents. The National Child Development
Agency (NCDA) oversees all nutrition promotion-related activities, standard-setting, curricula and
implementation approaches to provide national guidance to programme implementers.
Policy Framework around Nutrition (Stunting): Several policies and frameworks govern Rwanda’s
nutrition sector. The National Food and Nutrition Policy (NFNP, 2014)43 articulates actions needed to
drive and sustain economic growth and poverty reduction; this agenda necessitates an innovative multi-
sector approach with sector-specific strategies, explicitly addressing the prevalence of stunting among
children under two years of age.

UNICEF RCO has supported the GoR to model and scale up integrated approaches44 to delivery of
programmes addressing the needs and rights of young children in Rwanda. The support includes the
DHCR, which is the focus of this evaluation.
1.2 Programme Introduction (Object of Evaluation)
This section describes the intervention that is being evaluated (also referred to as object of the
evaluation). The description includes an overview, goals and expected results, geographic scope and
implementation status, stakeholders and their roles, resources, participants (beneficiaries), and the
Programme’s significance and Theory of Change (ToC).
1.2.1 Programme Overview
The DHCR Programme (or EKN
Figure 1: Programme's Components
II) is a follow-up to UNICEF
Rwanda’s Nutrition programme
(referred to as EKN I)
implemented in 10 districts from
October 2013 to December
2016,45 with an aim to reduce
stunting in children under two
years of age. Alternatively, DHCR
broadened its thematic focus with
interventions targeting the ECD,
nutrition, water, sanitation and
hygiene (WASH), education and
social protection sectors. The
Programme’s design was driven
by identifying the cross-sectoral
issues that affect children’s
holistic development in Rwanda. It featured a multi-sectoral and integrated approach to address
immediate and underlying causes affecting optimal child growth and development. The implementation
was led by multiple stakeholders including public agencies, the private sector and civil society
organizations (CSO).46
Programme’s Goal
The Programme’s overall goal was “to improve human capital development in Rwanda by establishing
optimal conditions for children to achieve their full potential and build a solid foundation to develop into
adolescents with key problem-solving and socio-emotional competencies”.47 The Programme’s two
impact level indicators are mentioned below:
• Reduced stunting amongst children under five years (U5).
• Improved holistic development amongst young children.
Programme Strategies
The Programme used the following strategies across these components to achieve intended results:48
• Capacity development
• Dialogue and advocacy
• Evidence generation
• Public-private partnerships (PPP)
• Innovation and cross-sectoral linkages
Programme’s Timeline and Implementation Status
The DHCR was implemented between 2017 and 2022 (initially planned until 2020).49 The Programme
was extended by almost a year and six months due slow start of implementation in the beginning and
delays caused by COVID-19. The Programme was implemented in 14 districts (as mapped in Figure
44 Integrated ECD services include, but are not limited to, the following activities: (a) early learning and stimulation, (b) medical check-ups, (c) child growth
monitoring (d) birth registration control, protecting children from any abuse and neglect (e) provision of meals, (f) parent education program, (g) sensitization
on water, hygiene and sanitation (h) sustainability strategy, (I) early disability and special needs detection and referral.

Rights-Holders
Parents/caregivers of children aged 0-6 years. Decision-makers of target beneficiaries (children aged 0-6 years).
Programme Participants (Beneficiaries)
The DHCR’s principal beneficiaries included children aged 0-6 years, their parents and families, and
communities of 14 targeted districts. Other beneficiaries included a series of public sector entities and
CSOs that were involved in programme implementation and benefitted from capacity-building initiatives.
The Programme had set an intended target to reach 500,000 beneficiaries (children aged 0-6 and
families) but does not specify targets for capacity-building initiatives. Approximately 8.5 million
beneficiaries were reached through various interventions.51 However, there is a possibility of multiple
counting as one beneficiary might have received more than one intervention and was therefore counted
more than once. Refer to Appendix 5 which provides disaggregated data with respect to different
categories of programme beneficiaries.
Programme Resources and Donor
The Programme’s total budget was US$27 million primarily funded by the EKN.52 Table 2 provides the
comparative analysis of planned and utilised budget over the course of four years (until March 2021).

1.2.2 Significance of the Programme
Find below key aspects of the Programme that contribute to its significance.
• The Programme holds significance for GoR as its priorities align with the GoR’s nutrition and
ECD policies such as National Food and Nutrition Policy (2014), Nutrition Action Plan (2013-
2018), National Food and Nutrition Strategic Plan (2013-2018) and National ECD Policy (2016).
The Programme also supports the GoR to achieve the SDGs (specifically 2, 3, 4 and 16) in
reducing stunting and improving the childhood development status of the most vulnerable
communities at the national level (14 target districts out of total 30 districts). The successful
approaches and interventions could also potentially guide scale-up to other districts of Rwanda.
• The Programme holds significance for UNICEF for the above-mentioned reasons. In addition,
the Programme also offered an opportunity to develop and implement innovative models for
integrated service packages and engage stakeholders to coordinate efforts to reduce stunting
and provide ECD services to target communities.
• The Programme holds significance for the Kingdom of the Netherlands as it aligned with its
development priorities in Rwanda, including enhanced food and nutrition security and early
childhood development.
• The Programme significantly contributed to improving ECD and the nutrition status of
target communities (including reducing stunting numbers). Furthermore, improved community
awareness on critical maternal and child nutrition may improve health and nutrition in infants and
pregnant and lactating women.
1.2.3 Programme ToC
The overall goal of the multi-sectoral Programme was to establish optimal conditions for children to
achieve their full potential. It aimed to help them build critical problem-solving and socio-emotional
competencies, thereby increasing human capital development in Rwanda. The EKN-funded programme
interventions focused on young children, pre-natal to six years of age, including their parents and
families, thereby ensuring a continuum of care that enhances and sustains optimal child growth and
development. Refer to Appendix 6 for the Programme’s ToC which outlines the desired state of change
(or goal) i.e., improved human capital development in Rwanda. The ToC further stipulates impact,
outcome and output level results with identification of strategies that may lead to the desired change.
There are some elements omitted from the visual including assumptions and risks for the desired
change to take place.

Chapter 2: Evaluation Purpose, Objectives, Scope and Criteria
This chapter describes the evaluation purpose, objectives, criteria, scope (chronological, thematic and
geographic), key evaluation questions, stakeholders’ interests, and possible use of the evaluation
results.
2.1 Evaluation Purpose and Objectives
This is an endline evaluation commissioned towards the end of the intervention. The purpose of the
evaluation is to generate evidence of the Programme’s achievements vis-à-vis intended results. This
evaluation is a Summative Evaluation with a demonstrated accountability focus. With that there is a
considered focus on reflection and learning to enable both the GoR and UNICEF RCO to make an
evidence-based decision around continuity, improvements to and future scale-up of the intervention.
The evaluation objectives as outlined in the ToR were reviewed and rephrased, and these changes
were approved by the evaluation oversight forum i.e., Evaluation Reference Group (ERG) upon
approval of the inception report. The rephrased objectives are presented below:
1. To objectively assess programme achievements by drawing a comparison between baseline
and endline data (for indicators that feed into the Programme’s logframe) and any gaps and
challenges (in achieving intended results);
2. To assess and offer a considered opinion around the Programme’s achievements as per
OECD-DAC criteria, i.e., relevance, coherence, efficiency, effectiveness, impact, sustainability;
3. To assess the integration of gender equality and equity principles/approaches and results
achieved across DHCR components and interventions;
4. To assess the contributions of UNICEF and other partners for the successful implementation
of DHCR, and;
5. To identify the lessons learned (by the stakeholders) and list recommendations for continuity,

2.3 Evaluation Scope, Criteria and Key Questions
This subsection outlines the evaluation scope, criteria and key questions separately.
2.3.1 Evaluation Scope
The evaluation scope with respect to thematic, chronological and geographic aspects is mentioned
below. The scope did not change as defined in the evaluation ToR.
• Chronological scope: All programme activities implemented from 2017 to 2021.
• Thematic focus: All EKN-funded programme activities focusing on gender, equity and child
rights dimensions.
Endline Evaluation of the Developing Human Capital in Rwanda (DHCR) Programme 8
• Geographic focus: All 14 districts where DHCR was implemented (including Nyamagabe,
Ngororero, Rutsiro, Gakenke, Burera, Rubavu, Nyaruguru, Karongi, Gicumbi, Nyamasheke,
Gatsibo, Rusizi, Nyagatare and Musanze). It is important to note that the nutrition-sensitive
activities implemented in the other 16 districts do not fall within the evaluation scope of this study.
2.3.2 Evaluation Criteria and Key Evaluation Questions
The evaluation followed the standard
Figure 3: Evaluation Criteria
OECD-DAC53 criteria comprising
relevance, coherence, effectiveness,
efficiency, impact and sustainability.
The ToR also included coordination
(non-DAC criterion) to assess the
coordination structures developed by
DHCR. For consistency, the evaluation
team has merged this element with the
effectiveness criterion; this change was
approved by UNICEF during the
inception phase. There is also
considered focus on UNICEF’s cross-
cutting programming priorities including
gender equality, equity and human
rights-based programming (particularly concerning child rights) which have been treated as non-DAC
criteria.
The evaluation questions (as listed in the ToR) were critically reviewed, discussed and rephrased
(listed in Table 4) to fit into the Evaluation Matrix (see Appendix 7). These changes were approved in
advance by the ERG upon approval of the inception report. Find below the final list of key evaluation
questions for DAC and non-DAC criteria.
Table 4: Key Evaluation Questions

Chapter 3: Evaluation Methodology, Quality Assurance and Ethics
This chapter describes the evaluation design, methodology and data sources, sampling strategy, data
analysis approach, compliance to United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) norms and standards,
limitations and mitigation measures, and evaluation implementation and management.
3.1 Evaluation Design
The evaluation was guided by two overarching approaches Figure 4: Evaluation Design
including mixed-method54 and participatory.55 The mixed-
method approach (featuring desk review, household (HH)
survey, KIIs with key stakeholders and FGDs with
communities) helped collect information from varied sources
to overcome any method-related deficiencies and gather rich
and complementary information for cross validation and
triangulation. Similarly, the participatory approach facilitated
engaging all relevant stakeholders (e.g., the ERG) to inform
the evaluation as well as provide oversight. The evaluation
was informed by the opinions, experiences and suggestions of
key stakeholders, including service providers (at national,
provincial, district and community levels); rights-holders
(farmers, mothers, fathers and community influencers); technical and financial partners (UNICEF RCO
and EKN) and key IPs.
Keeping in view the Programme’s design and evaluation expectations, the evaluation team applied a
Hybrid Evaluation Design, featuring two sub-designs i.e., contribution analysis56 and comparative
analysis.57 Contribution analysis was applied for measurement of outcome achievements and to
assess whether the Programme interventions contributed to the observed changes. As a form of
comparative analysis, the evaluation team has used Before-After Design.58 This implies that the
evaluation team has drawn a baseline and endline comparison for intervention districts (where a
baseline was conducted). The endline values have been compared against the baseline to measure
the ‘net impact’ for indicators that feed into the Programme’s logframe. It is important to note that Quasi-
Experimental Design was initially proposed for this endline study but was replaced with Before-After
design during the inception phase. Refer to Appendix 8 for the rationale behind the departure from the
proposed design.
Figure 5: Evaluation Methods
3.2 Evaluation Methods
The evaluation employed a Mixed-Methods
approach (refer to Figure 5), whereby both
quantitative and qualitative methods were
applied to generate usable evidence to
inform evaluation analysis, conclusions and
recommendations. Methodology was slightly
adapted in view of the partial lockdown
imposed in Rwanda due to COVID-19.
Find below an overview of the evaluation
methodology.
3.2.1 Desk Review
The evaluation team reviewed 82 documents (such as the programme proposal, progress and financial
reports, baseline, midline and ECD and nutrition-related law and policies). The desk review remained
an ongoing process throughout the evaluation as it enabled a better understanding of the context, the
interventions, results, challenges and learning. A systematic approach was applied during desk
54 Mixed Methods research design is a procedure for collecting, analysing, and ‘mixing’ both quantitative and qualitative research and methods in a single
study to understand a research problem.
55 Participatory evaluation is an approach that involves the stakeholders of a programme or policy in the evaluation process. This involvement can occur
at any stage of the evaluation process, from the evaluation design to the data collection and analysis and the reporting of the study.
56 Contribution analysis explores attribution through assessing the contribution a programme is making to observed results.
(https://www.betterevaluation.org/en/plan/approach/participatory_evaluation).
57 Comparative analysis is the process of comparing items to one another and distinguishing their similarities and differences.

research. This entailed initial screening and classification (whereby documents were organized and
catalogued according to the type of documents), broader themes were identified (keeping in view the
evaluation matrix) and relevant information was extracted using word search and general reading. The
information thus gathered was used to appropriately respond to evaluation questions either on its own
or with the primary data collected through field research. Refer to Appendix 9 that provides a complete
list of documents reviewed during evaluation.
3.2.2 Quantitative Data Collection
For quantitative data collection, a HH survey was Figure 6: Sampling Distribution per District
administered in 1352 households in seven districts
(refer to Figure 6 for sampling distribution per
district) with a mother or female caregiver of children
aged 6-23 months. The endline followed the same
methodology and approach as applied during the
baseline study. For the baseline, a comprehensive
assessment tool was designed to measure several
internationally recognized indicators covering
household characteristics, child development,
nutrition, health, caregiving practices and access to
services. The evaluation team refined the baseline
tool during the inception phase to focus on those
indicators that directly feed into the Programme’s
logframe (refer to Appendix 10 for HH survey
endline tool).
Following the sampling plan laid out in the baseline, the endline used the Cochran’s sample size
formula59 with the assumption that about 9.4 percent of all the households had children between 6–23
months, as well as two-sided alpha significance level of 0.05, plus a margin of error of ±4 percent. Prior
to the HH survey, a household listing exercise was conducted where all those households (1637)60 that
participated in the baseline study were visited. From the planned 1637 HHs, only 411 eligible
households (who still had a child aged 6-23 months) were identified. After consultation with UNICEF
RCO, the evaluation team replaced these households with other households in the same villages to
reach a sample size of 1352.
More details on sampling frame, rationale, the anthropometric measurements, and strategies used for
selection of HHs, and respondents are given in the Appendix 11.
3.2.3 Qualitative Data Collection
KIIs with stakeholders and FGDs with communities were used to collect qualitative data. Keeping in
view the local restrictions (in the shape of partial lockdown) due to COVID-19, some of the KIIs were
remotely conducted. Before providing details on each individual method, the following descriptions
highlight the sampling approach that was applied to select districts and respondents for qualitative data
collection methods.
Sampling for Qualitative Data Collection: In terms of geographic sampling, the evaluation team
randomly selected three treatment districts namely Burera, Nyaruguru and Rutsiro (one from each
province) for district level KIIs and FGDs. The evaluation team employed a purposive sampling
approach61 to identify the respondents of KIIs and FGDs. The selection of KII respondents was driven
by the purpose of involving all those stakeholders who have been involved directly or indirectly in
programme design and implementation. This ensured gathering of a diverse range of opinions to inform
the evaluation findings. For FGDs, those groups were selected which directly or indirectly benefitted or
have been involved in the Programme’s activities at the community level. The descriptions below outline
the key aspects of each data collection method.
59 Cochran formula allows you to calculate an ideal sample size given a desired level of precision, desired confidence level, and the estimated proportion of
the attribute present in the population.
60 UNICEF provided the evaluation team with the list of households that participated in the baseline study.
61 Purposive sampling, also known as judgmental, selective or subjective sampling, is a form of non-probability sampling in which researchers rely on their
own judgment when choosing members of the population to participate in their study. Better Evaluation, ‘Purposive Sampling’,

Endline Evaluation of the Developing Human Capital in Rwanda (DHCR) Programme 12
Key Informant Interviews (KIIs): The Figure 7: Distribution of KIIs
evaluation team conducted all planned 39
KIIs with key stakeholders including UNICEF,
relevant public ministries, IPs and the donor
(refer to Figure 7 for the distribution). The KIIs
were used to draw in-depth understanding of
the views of participants on DHCR design,
implementation, achievements, challenges,
lesson learnt and scalability. The evaluation
team employed semi-structured guidelines
(refer to Appendix 12), which were approved
by UNICEF Rwanda to interview key
informants at various levels (refer to Appendix
13 for complete list of people met during KIIs).
Focus Group Discussions (FGD): The Figure 8: Distribution of FGD Participants
evaluation team conducted 30 FGDs with
respondents from various categories
including mothers, fathers, farmers,
community influencers, CHWs and ECD
teachers. A total of 293 participants (139
male and 154 female) participated in FGDs
and shared their opinions and perceptions as
rights-holders in three districts. Structured guides were used (see Appendix 14 for FGD guides) to steer
the discussions. Figure 8 shows the number of participants who participated from each group category
(refer to Appendix 15 for more details on participants of the FGDs).
Validation Workshop: The evaluation team held a virtual validation workshop on May 24, 2022, with
national and subnational stakeholders after the submission of the draft evaluation report to finalise the
findings and recommendations with the participation of key stakeholders (UNICEF, MoH, MIGEPROF,
MINAGRI, and others).
Field Photographs: The evaluation team took photographs (with permission) to support the field
findings (data triangulation) and presentation. Appendix 16 includes samples of the field photographs.
3.3 Quality Assurance of the Data Collection
The evaluation team applied the following approaches and processes for quality assurance purposes
of the data collection process.
Training and Pre-testing: The core evaluation team provided comprehensive remote training for KIIs
in December 2021 while the master training for FGDs and HH surveys was conducted from January
10-13, 2022. Following the master training, the national partner organized the enumerator trainings from
January 17-21, 2022 (refer to Appendix 17 for the training agenda). Post-training, the HH survey
questionnaire was pre-tested in 20 HHs in a nearby community within a conveniently approachable
location. The collected data was processed and analysed with minor revisions made in the HH survey
questionnaire based on the enumerators’ feedback.
General Quality Assurance: The evaluation team established and maintained strict quality assurance
field protocols. Key measures implemented included deployment of field supervisors (accompanying
interviews, on-spot checking), validation checks on the HH survey tool, dedicated quality assurance
staff (random spot-checks, 10 percent back-checks), gender balanced teams, ensuring voice
recordings of KIIs/FGDs, and maintaining close coordination and communication among all field staff
(Appendix 18 offers more details on actions implemented for quality assurance). Furthermore, three
field monitors were hired to monitor HH surveys and FGDs in each district. These monitors were
provided with checklists (refer to Appendix 19 for the spot check tool) to monitor the field team and
ensure adherence to the guidelines for conducting HH surveys and FGDs.
Safety and Protective Protocols implemented under COVID-19: In addition to general quality control
measures, the evaluation team ensured implementation of various safety and protective protocols to
ensure that all research participants/respondents and the evaluation team were not exposed to any
possible risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Key measures included a) maintaining safe distance;
b) avoiding physical contact; c) covering face with masks at all times; d) carrying and using sanitizer

during field work, and others (refer to Appendix 20 for more details on the measures undertaken by the
evaluation team).
Ethical Approval: The field work was initiated after obtaining the requisite ethical approval from the
Rwanda National Ethics Committee (RNEC) on 29 November 2021. For details relating to the process
of ethical approval and letter, refer to Appendix 21. All interviews from the respondents were initiated
after obtaining consent from respondents (refer to Appendix 12 and 13 for the consent forms).
3.4 Data Processing and Analysis
A parallel mixed method data analysis approach was employed whereby data from each strand
(qualitative and quantitative) was collected, processed and analysed to draw findings, conclusions and
recommendations.
Quantitative Data Analysis: The household listing and survey data was collected using computer-
assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) devices whereby data was uploaded on the local partner’s server.
The quantitative data analysis utilised cross tabulation and frequency tables using SPSS (see Appendix
22 for HH survey tabulations). Findings from the analysis of HH survey results were corroborated and
triangulated with qualitative data and secondary information to formulate valid arguments against the
evaluation questions and sub-questions. The evaluation team also utilised and analysed data from
secondary sources (progress reports, budget/expense sheets) to validate and triangulate evaluation
findings.
Qualitative Data Analysis: The qualitative data analysis utilised a content and thematic analysis
approach62 using MaxQDA.63 The process involved: 1) transcribing the qualitative data collected
through KIIs and FGDs; 2) compiling and consolidating field notes; 3) coding qualitative data; 4) collating
and summarising data into categories and themes, as deemed necessary to answer evaluation
questions and sub-questions.
3.5 Integration of HRBA, Gender Equality and Equity in the Evaluation
This evaluation benefitted from and adhered to all applicable principles as prescribed by the United
Nations System-wide Action Plan (UN-SWAP 2.0, 2018) on Gender Equality and the Empowerment of
Women (GEEW).64 Refer to Table 5 below for the measures taken by the evaluation team to ensure
compliance with UNICEF’s cross-cutting priorities during each stage of the evaluation:
Table 5: Integration of HRBA, GE and Equity in the Evaluation
Evaluation Phase Measures Taken for Compliance
Design • The evaluation matrix included a separate section to include specific questions, sub-questions and
indicators on gender equality, HRBA and equity.
• The selection of evaluation methods ensured inclusion or participation of duty-bearers and rights-holders
(male/female, rural/urban, literate/illiterate, etc.)
• Specific guides were applied for each stakeholder (duty-bearers, rights-holders, donors) under each
evaluation method (KII or FGD).
• Appropriate capacity-building of all evaluation team members was ensured.
Implementation • Gender balanced teams were deployed for data collection. For HH surveys, only female staff was
deployed to demonstrate respect to cultural norms.
• To ensure perspectives of all relevant stakeholders are included in evaluation findings, the evaluation
team reached 1688 participants (91 percent female) through HHs, KIIs and FGDs.
• For HH survey, 1352 mothers/caregivers were interviewed to assess their knowledge, awareness and
practices against several components.
• In FGDs, significant participation of both genders was attained. Out of 293 participants, 139 were male
(47 percent) and 154 were female (53 percent).
• For FGDs, separate discussions were conducted with mothers and fathers.
Analysis and • Analysis of all data was disaggregated by parameters of gender equality, HRBA and equity.
Reporting • Distinct coding for gender equality, HRBA and equity was implemented to extract themes.
• The synthesis of evaluation findings, conclusion and recommendations were informed with the above key
considerations.

3.6 Compliance to UNEG/UNICEF Adopted Norms and Standards
A brief overview of the measures planned and implemented to ensure compliance to UNEG65 and
UNICEF’s adapted norms and ethical standards is outlined below (for more details, refer to Appendix
23 and 24).
• Independence and impartiality: The evaluation team members had no conflict of interest and
no role in the implementation of programme activities, and the staff was able to evaluate the
DHCR without the influence of any outside party.
• Credibility: The evaluation team applied a participatory data collection methodology (involving a
range of relevant stakeholders for feedback) and triangulation of reported findings by using an
analysis of evidence from both primary and secondary data sources.
• Utility: UNICEF is committed to publish and disseminate duly quality-assured evaluation reports
in the public domain without undue influence by any party.
• Professionalism: The evaluation team is comprised of professionals with extensive knowledge,
training and experience working with multiple clients on local and international projects.
• Avoidance of Harm: The evaluation team took requisite measures in light of COVID-19 (details
in section 3.3). Some of the in-person interviews were replaced with remote interviews to avoid
COVID-19 related contraction risks.
• Privacy of Participants: The participants were informed about protocols for protection of their
private data and that the data was password protected. The feedback and opinions of the
respondents included in the final report are anonymous to maintain the confidentiality of the
respondents.

Conclusions
This chapter presents the evaluation findings, analysis and preliminary conclusions. The description
includes key findings for each question (and sub-questions) under each criterion. The findings are
drawn from both primary and secondary data sources. Preliminary conclusions for each question are
placed at the end of each sub-section.
4.1 Relevance
EQ1 – To what extent was DHCR design (objectives and strategies) informed by
national/local nutrition and ECD needs (children 0-6, including the most disadvantaged),
and to what extent did design include the relevant stakeholders, and evolve to
accommodate the changing context?
The relevance criterion has one key question and two sub-questions.
EQ1.1 – How relevant is DHCR design—objectives, components and strategies—to GoR and
partners’ nutrition and ECD policies/plans, and does it remain consistent with them?
The findings are grouped into three sub-sections, whereby the first section outlines alignment (in terms
of outcomes) between DHCR and GoR policies and plans (including development partners). The
second section presents findings around the level of engagement of national stakeholders in the design
of DHCR. The third and the last describes the contextual evolution and corresponding adaptations made
in the Programme’s design and delivery. The findings are primarily drawn from the desk review and
analysis leverages comparative techniques.
DHCR Outcomes Alignment with GoR Policies and Plans (including Development Partners)
To keep findings focused around ECD and nutrition, the following matrix (Table 7) presents findings
and analysis around overlaps between DHCR outcomes (objectives) and those of GoR sectoral policies
i.e., National ECD Policy 2016 and National Nutrition and Food Policy 2014. For overlaps between
DHCR strategies and those of GoR’s broader development policies and plans, refer to Appendix 27.

1. Literature review and consultations with key stakeholders suggest an extensive review and broader
consultative process spread over several months that contributed to the design of DHCR. These
included: proposal development workshop (March 2016), joint reviews, validation meeting (May
2016) and bilateral meetings (UNICEF and EKN) involving internal and external reviews.
2. Below are details on the steps taken to include key stakeholders in the design phase. Discussions
with key stakeholders indicate that the process was extensive and participatory.
• Proposal development workshop (March 2016): In which 48 representatives participated
from GoR, development partners, civil society, private sector and academia.69 The workshop
aimed to: (i) build a common understanding of the proposal objectives and proposed
intervention areas; (ii) plan key interventions for each sector; and (iii) identify opportunities for
programme integration and joint interventions between sectors, as well as potential linkages
and synergies for collaboration with the private sector. The workshop resulted in participants
agreeing on their roles and responsibilities, including a proposal completion procedure and
schedule.
• Joint Reviews: After incorporating different stakeholders’ input into a draft proposal, UNICEF
organized follow-up meetings with line ministries and technical partners for joint review.
• Validation Meeting (May 2016): The agreed key interventions were presented to technical
personnel from all relevant line ministries for validation.
• Bilateral UNICEF-EKN Meetings: Following the validation meeting, UNICEF held a bilateral
meeting with EKN technical personnel to examine and finalise the proposal paper, which was
externally reviewed by EKN specialists.
Evolving Needs and Programmatic Adaptations

of programme implementation, the details of which are as follows:70

• The drop in multiple micronutrient powder (MNP) coverage from 86 percent (2019) to 42
percent (2020) was caused by changes in GoR’s medicine and nutrition supply chain
management systems, including new institutional homes governing these functions namely the
newly established Rwanda Medical Centre (RMC) and the Food and Drug Agency (FDA).
These changes caused delays in clearance of nutrition commodities and, consequently,
periodic stock outs.73
• Desk review indicates that programme implementation was adjusted in light of new sectoral
policies and plans. These policies included the Social Protection Strategy (2018-2024),
National Social and Behaviour Change Communication Strategy for Integrated Early Childhood
Development, Nutrition and WASH (2018-2024).

• The desk review points to the scale-up of the National School Feeding Programme in view of
the arrival of some 65,000 Burundian refugees74 in Rwanda in 2020. This affected
approximately 35,286 refugee children and host community children attending the same
schools as refugee children.75
• COVID-19 posed several challenges to DHCR implementation, such as: closure of ECD
centres, delayed supplies (to the ECD centres), cancellation of farmer promoters training,
impeded community mobilisation and campaigns (such as for Vitamin A campaigns), and
discontinuation of field monitoring. Desk review and discussions with stakeholders indicate that
the Programme adopted online and electronic modes of communication with community
members to mitigate mobility challenges.
EQ1.2 – Was programme design adequately informed and appropriate to address needs of
children aged 0-6 (including the most disadvantaged)?
The findings are structured into two parts. The first part outlines the number/types of assessments used
or undertaken to identify the nutrition and ECD (the two most important sectors/themes) needs for
children 0-6. The second part matches programme interventions that address the drivers for 0-6
malnutrition and limited enrolment in ECD centres.
Assessments to Identify Local Nutrition and ECD Needs (0-6 Children)
4. Desk review indicates that prior to designing DHCR, a series of consultative sessions were
conducted with beneficiary communities, local leaders and service providers to identify needs and
priorities. In addition, UNICEF and GoR undertook a situation analysis to ensure the interventions
were aligned with national priorities, plans and policies.
5. The Programme took a hybrid approach to identify local nutrition and ECD needs, whereby it used
the existing national data (from RDHS 2014-2015) and did multiple studies to collect usable data to
design DHCR interventions. Data from primary and secondary sources enabled mapping of the
extent and drivers of the problem.
• Desk review further indicates that a capacity gap analysis of key stakeholders was conducted
in 2018; the aim of this exercise was to formulate an integrated capacity development plan for
relevant stakeholders.
• The Programme mainly used RDHS data to identify the most impoverished districts. The
Programme selected 14 districts (out of 30 total districts), by using multiple deprivation criteria
including poverty and prevalence of stunting (refer to Appendix 3 for the rationale behind district
selection).
• In 2018, a mapping study of the private sector was concluded. Consequently, linkages were
developed with 20 companies and corporations across strategic industries.
• Desk review and discussions with UNICEF indicate that UNICEF and NCDA undertook the first
ethnographic study to explore nutrition and WASH practices to understand the bottlenecks
around these problems.
Excerpts from KIIs on assessments undertaken to identify local nutrition and ECD needs (for children aged 0-6 years)
“A mapping study on a public-private partnership was conducted to inform integration with other relevant sectors from a strategic point
on tiers one, two and three. The mapping study also helped in the development of a public-private strategy that functions as a guiding
tool to direct the engagement with other private sectors even when the funding ends. For the private sector engagement, tea companies,
telecom, rice and mining companies are engaged. Moreover, various informal assessments were undertaken; and the tea sector was
identified with the most programmatic need. Tea is grown in twelve districts of Rwanda; however, a comprehensive food vulnerability
study showed higher malnutrition rates in the tea belt. To identify the factors contributing to malnutrition various stakeholders including
managers of tea companies were engaged by National Agriculture Development Board (NAEB) and it was revealed that there were
large numbers of children in the tea plantation sector. Therefore, the Programme extended its interventions in tea plantations to better
address the needs.” – Government
“In 2019-2020, UNICEF together with NECDP conducted the first ethnographic study on nutrition in the communities to explore nutrition
and WASH practices. The study explored the barriers preventing healthier nutrition and WASH practices amongst communities in the
country. The study identified that the communities had awareness around healthier nutrition practices, for instance people understand
what they need to do to give their child a healthy diet; however, they were not practising health nutrition practices even when they were
aware of them. Therefore, the UNICEF team invested more in social behaviour change communication, sensitization campaigns and
generation of income sources, etc.” – UNICEF
“We undertook a baseline survey for this programme which helped us to identify needs but simultaneously when we started the
implementation of the programme, there were consultations with line ministries and communities.” – UNICEF

Preliminary Conclusions: Relevance
REL 1: The findings indicate overlaps between DHCR outcomes and strategies with those of national and development partners’
policies and plans (in particular for nutrition and ECD sectors), which illuminate the Programme’s relevance. Ample evidence is available
to suggest an inclusive process to involve key stakeholders in the design—including extensive consultations, joint reviews, validation
meetings and bilateral meetings. Although there is evidence of significant changes in the context and beneficiary needs due to several
factors (including government restructuring, changes in policy mandates and COVID-19), there is limited evidence of the Programme
making design-level adjustments in terms of changes in results framework and budget.
REL 2: The relevance is evident as the Programme used both primary and secondary data (involving baseline 2019, capacity gap
analysis, ethnographic study) to understand the local dynamics and needs to inform the Programme’s design. The selection of
programme districts is driven by multi-factor vulnerability assessment. Programme design (strategies/interventions) is appropriate for
addressing both the demand and supply-side barriers to malnourishment and development delays such as: capacity-building (of both
duty-bearers and rights-holders); dialogue and advocacy (for uptake of promoted behaviour); public-private partnership (for linkages
with businesses and ECD centres); and evidence generation (for effective decision-making).
4.2 Coherence
EQ2 – To what extent did the Programme utilise internal (in terms of synergies,
interlinkages) and external (in terms of complementarities, harmonization) coherence?
The coherence criterion has one key question and one sub-question.
EQ2.1 – Was the Programme consistent (or otherwise) with internal and external nutrition and
ECD priorities?
Endline Evaluation of the Developing Human Capital in Rwanda (DHCR) Programme 22
The findings are grouped into two sub-sections, whereby the first sub-section presents findings around
internal coherence i.e., interventions that were jointly implemented/coordinated by different UNICEF
units (WASH, Health, Social Protection, Communication for Development (C4D), ECD, Nutrition). The
second sub-section outlines external coherence i.e., mechanisms/process (pre/during the Programme)
adopted to identify the synergies with other programmes and/or partners to leverage complementarities
and to avoid duplication.
Internal Coherence
Find below key findings on how the Programme worked across different sections within UNICEF and
leveraged the strengths and resources available within UNICEF RCO.
6. Refer to section 4.1 (under relevance) for findings on coherence/alignment of DHCR’s outcomes
and strategies with those of GoR’s sectoral polices and plans.
7. Desk review indicates that UNICEF’s Deputy Representative and relevant section chiefs (Nutrition,
ECD, WASH, Education and Social Protection) remained involved during the proposal development
stage.76 These consultations aimed to jointly strategize and identify priority interventions for areas
required across different sectors and levels in order to achieve stunting reduction and improvement
of child development outcomes.
8. Discussions with UNICEF indicate that the task forces for each programme component convened
on a monthly basis, allowing the section chiefs and other technical officers to discuss progress and
ongoing challenges. However, the evaluation team did not find any evidence on the occurrence and
outcome of these meetings.
9. At the design stage, an integrated UNICEF initiative was ongoing (funded by the IKEA Foundation),
which focused on ECD, nutrition, health, WASH, child protection and social protection in 10 districts.
As per the consultations with UNICEF, lessons learned and best practices from this initiative fed
into DHCR programming. The evaluation team did not find any evidence on how this initiative
helped during the planning phase.
10. Joint monitoring visits (every two months) by relevant sections were made to DHCR target districts
to report on the progress made and bottlenecks impeding the progress. Respondents from UNICEF
shared that these visits have strengthened collaborative targeting and helped in efficient use of
resources.
External Coherence
Find below key findings on how the Programme worked with external actors to leverage synergies and
avoid geographic and intervention overlaps. Findings related to the coordination systems and their
efficacy are included under the effectiveness section (4.4).
11. The findings indicate commissioning of multiple studies (between 2014 and 2015) to map
stakeholders and interventions. These studies enabled key DHCR actors to plan and implement
interventions (including targeting of beneficiaries and locations) to avoid duplication with other
actors. The studies carried out include: Nutrition Stakeholder & Action Mapping (2015), ECD
Mapping Study (2014) and Mapping of WASH Coverage (2015).
12. At the beginning of DHCR, selection criteria (based on human capital indicators) were used to
define the universe for DHCR interventions, which was further discussed with key public sector and
development actors during the proposal stage consultations. This enabled overcoming potential
duplication and overlaps with similar initiatives. Discussions with UNICEF suggest that the selection
of districts took a considered view not to overlap with United States Agency for International
Development (USAID)-led integrated Nutrition-WASH intervention districts (implemented in eight
districts). The target districts do not overlap with USAID-supported interventions.
13. Forums used for coordination are mentioned below. These forums have increased ownership and
improved coordination around various initiatives including nutrition, ECD, WASH, child protection
and social protection:
• For integrated multi-sectoral programme
interventions, an overall coordination “UNICEF developed a joint action plan with the

• In 2017, the National Secretariat for Nutrition
was set up and transformed into the NECDP

(and later NCDA) in order to coordinate nutrition and ECD initiatives. UNICEF co-chaired
coordination, whereas, the members of the Secretariat included line ministries, EKN,
development partners and civil society organizations.
• The national ECD Sub-cluster, chaired by NCDA and co-chaired by UNICEF and NCDA,
enhanced coordination at national and decentralized levels; and increased participation and
integration of key thematic areas of health, nutrition, education, WASH and protection.
14. The Programme built effective linkages with the public sector to implement DHCR activities whilst
supporting the key stakeholders on systems strengthening. Some key initiatives are mentioned
below:77
• Collaboration with the Rwandan Women Parliamentary Forum (FFRP) to influence central and
decentralized governments to increase their commitment and accountability for nutrition.
• UNICEF partnered with the Ministry of Health, district authorities and a local partner, Society
for Family Health (SFH), to enable a holistic district-led approach to improving household
sanitation.
• Conducted a capacity gap analysis which identified gaps in knowledge, awareness and skills
related to results-based management (RBM). In response, UNICEF in coordination with
Rwanda Management Institute (RMI), trained key stakeholders on RBM and public finance
principles with the potential to improve project governance in Rwanda, particularly in managing
nutrition-relevant programmes.
• UNICEF partnered with Rwanda Health Communication Centre (RHCC) and MoH to develop
common sanitation and hygiene messages for use by all partners nationally. By 2021, UNICEF
reached 1,417,000 people in 11 districts with key sanitation and hygiene messages.
Furthermore, DHCR also partnered with religious networks, celebrities and theatres to reach
community members with stunting reduction messages.
• UNICEF partnered with the Workforce Development Authority to facilitate production of an ECD
kit (play and learning materials) to support children's stimulation in ECD spaces.
• UNICEF partnered with government agencies for scale-up of ECD work including National
Agricultural Export Development Board, Rwanda Mining Petroleum and Gas Board, Rwanda
Agriculture and Animal Resources Board.
15. Partnerships with the private sector have resulted in expansion of ECD centres in the country. By
2021, DHCR engaged with 32 businesses on ECD with partnerships across different fields, for
example with telecoms—providing data free access to information on nutrition and ECD;
engagement of new sectors such as rice and mining in providing child friendly workspaces, peer to
peer support to motivate investors to invest in ECD.
Preliminary Conclusions: Coherence
COH 1: Programme design managed to leverage internal coherence in terms of engagement of multiple sections within UNICEF and
evolve a programme that addresses the multiple dimensions that cause stunting and undermine holistic child development. The
evaluation team found limited evidence around how programme design translated into more collaborative implementation across
UNICEF sections, which merits better documentation in order to understand the purpose and functionality.
COH 2: The Programme took a systematic approach to leverage external complementarities across stakeholders. Key enablers include:
i) conducting studies to map stakeholders and interventions to develop a holistic view of actors and interventions; ii) collaborative
consultations during the proposal stage to ensure there were no duplication of efforts; iii) partnering with relevant government and
private entities to design and implement DHCR interventions; iv) use of existing platforms (NECDP, SUN network, national ECD sub-
cluster, child development technical working group, religious network, celebrities) to coordinate, collaborate, plan and reflect with other
development partners and relevant government agencies to implement DHCR activities, whilst avoiding duplication and overlap.
4.3 Efficiency
EQ3 – To what extent did DHCR allocate and deploy resources (time, funds, capacity-
building - through nutrition and ECD materials, management arrangements) to achieve
intended results?
This section has one main question and two sub questions.
EQ3.1 – Did DHCR deploy resources (time, funds, capacity-building - through nutrition and ECD
materials, management arrangements) to achieve intended results?
It should be noted that the efficiency assessment remains incomplete due to unavailability of complete
performance data (progress and expenditures shared until March 2021). Furthermore, as discussed
under section 1.2 (sub-section on programme beneficiaries), the evaluation team has used 8.5 million
77 Progress Reports.
Endline Evaluation of the Developing Human Capital in Rwanda (DHCR) Programme 24
figure as the total number of beneficiaries reached out by the Programme, with a caveat that the number
hints at double counting.
The findings and analysis are structured across four resource inputs and other elements i.e., time,
funds, capacity-building (through nutrition and ECD materials), and management arrangements.
Findings are primarily drawn from the secondary data, however where appropriate, stakeholders’ views
(primary data) are included to complement these findings.
DHCR Efficiency vis-à-vis Allocated Time
Find below key findings around adequacy of time to achieve intended results (including achieved
results). Moreover, the findings list key factors (internal and external) that caused delays in
implementation, hence undermined achievements, and the measures undertaken to mitigate the time
delays.
16. The readers may note that the original programme life cycle was from 2017-2020 (extension was
sought till June 2022), during which DHCR intended to reach 500,000 direct beneficiaries (including
children and families) with nutrition (for example through Vitamin A supplementation, micro nutrition,
deworming, ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUFT) and iron folic supplementation) and ECD (care
facilities, play groups, toy libraries) services. Targets for other beneficiaries (for instance, through
sensitisation activities, capacity-building initiatives, WASH support) were not determined at the
design stage. Against the direct beneficiary target, the Programme managed to reach 8.5 million78
beneficiaries (data available up to March 2021), however, this number hints at doubt counting of
beneficiaries.
17. Programme implementation faced multiple delays. For

related activities such as ECD centres.
18. As outlined above, the Programme sought a no-cost
extension for June 2022. This was warranted for underutilisation of allocated funds i.e., the
Programme only used three-fourths of the allocated funds by March 2021 (more details to follow).
DHCR Efficiency vis-à-vis Allocated Funds
19. The allocated funds for DHCR come to $27.4 million for the complete life cycle (including extension).
The Programme managed to reach 8.5 million beneficiaries (it should be noted that this number
may not be accurate due to double counting) far exceeding the beneficiary outreach targets, while
spending only 79 percent ($21,712,256) of allocated funds. To the evaluation team, the massive
over-achievement rate (for outreach targets) without using the allocated budget raises questions
about whether budgeting was realistic.
20. None of the key implementers made reference to fund shortages and/or delays in funds provision.
The Programme sought a no-cost extension to use the remaining funds, which was granted.

During interaction with the evaluation team, some
key informants flagged inadequate availability/distribution of ECD material (books, toys, etc.)
specifically during the outbreak of COVID-19.
Management Arrangements
23. The Programme managed to evolve a ‘hybrid’ management model whereby UNICEF provided
technical assistance, GoR took lead in the implementation, and additional support was provided by
78 Number changed by UNICEF on May 25, 2022.
Endline Evaluation of the Developing Human Capital in Rwanda (DHCR) Programme 25
IPs and the private sector (especially for ECD services). The fact that the Programme managed to
massively over-achieve the outreach targets, suggests that the hybrid management arrangements
worked efficiently. Although limited secondary data is available regarding management
arrangements being efficient, the evaluation team gathered from the respondents that it worked
well and enabled efficient delivery. Some even pointed to the fact that CSO partners facilitated
outreach to hard-to-reach communities.
24. The UNICEF RCO team members shared that the scale and complexity of the Programme tested
the capacity of available staff within UNICEF CO. Although they managed to deliver the results,
they may have had provided more oversight if they had more human resources within UNICEF.
25. The Programme engaged with a range of stakeholders for varied functions, where each was to
work with and coordinate with others at multiple levels. The evaluation team did not receive much
documented evidence on how these actors worked with each other and what type of challenges
they faced. It could be that this information is available, however it has not been shared with the
evaluation team.
EQ3.2 – Are unit costs comparable to other sectors? Could the same results be achieved with
fewer resources by applying alternative strategies?
The findings are grouped into two sections, where the first presents balanced resource allocations vs
components and the second section includes cost/beneficiary calculations. Data availability affected
the analysis below. For instance, the evaluation team only received expenditures data for 2017-2021
(March), whereas the budget is available for the whole programme cycle i.e., 2017-2022 (June). The
data does not provide justification/rationale for budgetary revisions.
Balanced Funds Allocations across Components/Outcomes
26. Figure 10 presents the
Figure 10: Percentage Distribution of Allocated vs Utilized
cost distributions
(including expenditures)
across seven
components. Across the
components, nutrition
(outcome 1) remains at
the top with 42 percent of
total funds allocated from
2017-2022, of which 50
percent were used by the
end of 2020 (expenditure
data is available for 2017-
March 2021). This is
followed by ECD for which
the allocated funds were
13 percent. For other components the allocated funds range from 2 percent to 11 percent. Refer to
Appendix 30 for the calculations.
27. As DHCR was primarily a nutrition intervention, around which other thematic interventions were
cobbled, the allocation of 2/5 of the funds looks reasonable. There is no basis for the evaluation
team to judge whether the funds allocation across components was rationale and balanced.
28. The evaluation team used financial data
Figure 11: Year wise Budget Planned and Utilised
(budget vs actual for 2017-2021 March)
to plot the allocations and expenditures
over time (see Figure 11). The exhibit
suggests that the Programme burnout
rate (budget vs actual) was much lower
in 2017 and 2018, compared to 2019
and 2020. This to a degree reflects
more efficient funds utilisation (and
possibly better performance) in the latter half of the Programme. Refer to Appendix 30 for the
calculations.
Cost per Beneficiary
Find below beneficiary cost calculations for multiple outcomes and also cumulative costs. It should be
noted that the evaluation team had expenditures data up to March 2021 and there is possible multiple
counting of beneficiaries.
Endline Evaluation of the Developing Human Capital in Rwanda (DHCR) Programme 26
29. Figure 12 exhibits planned
Figure 13: Cost per Beneficiary by Outcome
vs actual per beneficiary
costs across outcomes.
For all outcomes the
planned costs are
lower than actual costs.
For instance, for nutrition
actual cost is
$7.10/beneficiary as
against planned
$9.15/beneficiary.
Similarly, for ECD it is
$55.83/beneficiary
against the planned
$73.07. Refer to
Appendix 30 for the
calculations.
30. At the aggregate level (for the whole Figure 12: Cost/Beneficiary for Phase 1 and II
Programme), the (average) actual
cost per beneficiary comes to $2.05
(against the planned $2.65). This
shows that Programme delivered
results more efficiently, at least
against the planned cost per
beneficiary calculations. Refer to Appendix 30 for the calculations.
31. DHCR includes interventions across different thematic areas, therefore, a comparison between
DHCR and a similar programme was not possoble.
32. The cost/beneficiary comparison between EKN I and EKN II, suggests that EKN Phase II was
relatively more efficient. For EKN I, the (average) cost per beneficiary stood at $2.15,79 which
remained consistent for EKN II at $2.05.
Preliminary Conclusions: Efficiency
EFY 1: The evaluation team is unable to draw conclusions on the Programme’s efficiency due to unavailability of performance data
from March to December 2021. The Programme reached to 8.5. million beneficiaries against a target of 0.5 million (the number hints
to double counting of beneficiaries reached out by different interventions). In addition, the number was reached while using only 79
percent of allocated funds. As a result, it seems that the Programme set lower targets in comparison to the resources available.
EFY 2: The evaluation team is unable to conclude if the Programme demonstrated balanced distribution of funds across outcomes.
Nevertheless, this being a flagship intervention to improve nutrition, the allocation of 42 percent funds appears reasonable. The
combined allocations for nutrition and ECD come to around 55 percent (more than half of the funds). Temporally, the allocations were
relatively higher in the first half of the Programme.
EFY 3: The average per beneficiary cost appears reasonable at $2.05 for the Programme. For all outcomes the average/beneficiary
cost is lower than planned (based on data available) which further reinforces the assumption that the Programme may have set low
targets. The cost comparison between EKN 1 and EKN II underlines EKN II was as cost efficient as EKN I (in terms of cost/beneficiary).
4.4 Effectiveness
EQ4 – To what extent did DHCR achieve the intended results (outcomes and outputs),
including public sector capacity development (including communities), and factors that
influenced achievement (or non-achievement of results)?
The criterion has three key questions with four sub-questions. The measurement of effectiveness faced
constraints that are listed below.
• The effectiveness measurement is made using planned vs achieved results at the outcome level.
The outcome achievement data is only available from 2017 to March 2021, whereas no data is
available for last nine months of the Programme’s life (from April to December 2021). The
Programme sought a one year and a half year no extension and will close on 30 June 2022.
• The outcomes 1 (Nutrition), 3 (WASH), 6 (Integrated Multisectoral Interventions) and 7 (Private
Sector Linkages) have not been rated on the effectiveness scale. Due to incomplete outcome

Endline Evaluation of the Developing Human Capital in Rwanda (DHCR) Programme 27
• The HH survey (undertaken as part of the evaluation) has been used to make comparisons between
baseline and endline surveys. As noted in the limitation section above, a majority of the households
from the baseline survey were ineligible to participate in the endline survey. These households were
replaced with other households within the same villages carrying similar geographic and socio-
economic characteristics. The findings remain valid.
EQ4.1 – To what extent did DHCR achieve the intended results (outcomes)?
The findings for this criterion are structured into three sections. The first section offers an overview of
programme effectiveness vis-à-vis its achievements (in terms of planned vs achieved outcomes); the
second section focuses on comparison of baseline (2019) and endline (2022) numbers across key
components (Nutrition, ECD, WASH and Social Protection) to offer a perspective on the Programme’s
effectiveness; and the third section discusses the target-setting process and stakeholder participation.
Planned vs Achieved Outcomes
The evaluation has primarily used the Programme’s secondary data where each outcome is assessed
for level of achievements vis-a-vis planned outcome targets/indicators. To make the assessment more
objective, the evaluation team has rated each outcome on a scale of relative effectiveness, by applying
the following rating criterion:
Fully Achieved Mostly Achieved Slightly Achieved Least Achieved Not Achieved
91 – 100% 66 - 90% 36 - 65% 11 - 35% 0 - 10%
Find below the visual presentation of outcome level achievements:
Figure 14: Programme’s Outcome-level Achievements
33. The Programme has 7 outcomes and 18 outputs. Outcome level achievements are used to provide
commentary on the Programme’s effectiveness (a summary is provided here; for a detailed matrix
of outcome and output achievements, refer to Appendix 28). The Programme’s overall progress
against seven outcome indicators is presented below. Against seven outcome indicators, complete
data is only available for three outcomes.
Programme Effectiveness: Baseline and Endline Comparison for Key Components
(Nutrition, Health, ECD, WASH and Social Protection)
This section brings together findings around the Programme’s effectiveness by offering a comparison
between the baseline (undertaken in 2019) and endline survey (HH survey mirroring the baseline was
undertaken as part of the evaluation in 2022). The comparison focuses on selected aspects across
Endline Evaluation of the Developing Human Capital in Rwanda (DHCR) Programme 28
different programme components i.e., Nutrition, Health, ECD, WASH and Social Protection. A
comparative table for all indicators covered in the baseline and endline is attached as Appendix 29.
The readers may note that the endline survey (2022) was carried out in the same communities where
the baseline (2019) was administered. Moreover, it used the identical sampling approach and
household selection criteria (data is from seven districts only). The only point of departure is that the
endline survey tool is a redacted version of the baseline HH survey tool (covers only 46 indicators
against 119 in the baseline). Please note that the redacted version was implemented after agreement
with UNICEF RCO. The findings and analysis for each component are given below:
Nutrition
For the nutrition component, the endline covered 11 indicators out of 19 indicators covered in the
baseline. The following visual (Figure 15) offers a baseline and endline comparison for selected
indicators (for a consolidated table of all components and indicators, please refer to Appendix 29).
Figure 15:Baseline vs Endline: Nutrition
34. The comparison suggests a declining trend in stunting for 6-23 months (reduced from an average
31.3 percent to 29.7 percent), underweight (reduced from 13 percent to 11 percent); and moderate
acute malnutrition (from 5 percent to 3 percent).The data does not indicate a significant shift in
terms of gender—as more boys are stunted in 2022 than girls (21.6 percent vs 19.4 percent), as
was noted in the 2019 (35.3 percent vs 27.2 percent).
35. Data indicates an increase in number of children moderately wasted i.e., 3 percent to 5 percent.
This merits further exploration. One plausible factor could be COVID-19-driven impact on
livelihoods and food inflation, adversely effecting households’ ability to purchase adequate food.
Health Seeking Behaviours
For the health component, the endline covered 8 indicators out of 17 indicators included in the baseline.
The following visual (Figure 16) offers a baseline and endline comparison for selected indicators (for a
consolidated table of all components and indicators, please refer Appendix 29).
Figure 16: Baseline vs Endline: Health Seeking Behaviour
36. The comparison indicates that there are more people who are now using mosquito nets than at the
time of the baseline (increased by 8 percent). The data shows an incremental trend in occurrence
of diarrhoea (by 5 percent for 6-11 months and 12 percent for 12-23 months), which again merits
further exploration. Despite increase in episodes of diarrhoea, it is encouraging to note that the
percentage of caregivers who sought treatment for diarrhoea and fever has also increased (65
percent to 74 percent).
Endline Evaluation of the Developing Human Capital in Rwanda (DHCR) Programme 29
ECD
For the ECD component, the endline covered only 7 indicators from the baseline (of the total 18). The
following visual (Figure 17) offers a baseline and endline comparison for selected indicators (for a
consolidated table for all components and indicators, please refer Appendix 29).
Figure 17: Baseline vs Endline: ECD
37. The data indicates an incremental trend in caregiver support and involvement in learning activities
and improved access to ECD and community services e.g., primary caregivers engaging in ECD
activities; HHs listening to relevant radio station e.g., Itetero, caregiving practices and access to
ECD and community services. The data indicates a declining trend of children playing with toys
(from 24 percent to 12 percent) and household items (from 39 percent to 18 percent). This could
be because of supply shortages of toys due to COVID-19.
WASH
For the WASH component, the endline covered eight out of nine indicators included in the baseline.
The following visual offers a baseline and endline comparison for selected indicators (for a consolidated
table of all components and indicators, please refer Appendix 29).
Figure 18: Baseline vs Endline: WASH
38. The data indicates an improved access to WASH services and availability of Community Hygiene
Clubs. The data indicates increase in percentage of households with insufficient water in the past
two weeks, and households who pay for drinking water.
Social Protection
For the social protection component, the endline covered only 5 indicators from the baseline (of the
total 26). The following visual (Figure 19) offers a baseline and endline comparison for selected
indicators (for a consolidated table for all components and indicators, please refer Appendix 29).
Endline Evaluation of the Developing Human Capital in Rwanda (DHCR) Programme 30
Figure 19: Baseline vs Endline: Social Protection
39. Data indicates a decrease in participation in Vision 2020 Umurenge Programme (VUP) and Saving
Groups in the last 12 months. The data indicates a substantial increase in the percentage of VUP
households enrolled in classic public works from 37.5 percent to 91.6 percent.
EQ4.2 – What factors either enabled or hindered DHCR achievements? How did achievements
affect yearly planning?
The findings are structured into two parts i.e., i) enabling and disabling factors and their effects on
programme achievements; and ii) process of target setting and stakeholder participation.
Internal and External Factors
A host of enabling and disabling factors, both internal and external, affected programme achievements.
Find below the matrix that outlines those factors that either facilitated or hindered the implementation
and achievement of results. The findings are drawn from primary and secondary data.

of district government staff.
Endline Evaluation of the Developing Human Capital in Rwanda (DHCR) Programme 31
Annual Target Setting and Stakeholders’ Participation
40. The literature review indicates that DHCR targets were set in 2016 (at the start of programming)
and continued until the end of the programme cycle i.e., 2020. These targets were not revised in
view of the Programme’s no-cost extension until June 2022.
41. The annual target for stunting was reduced from
4.5 percent to 1.5 percent per year based on “For target setting, UNICEF worked with the government
and with partners to produce realistic and doable
findings from the mid-term review. The
estimates and district management provides data for
Comprehensive Food and Vulnerability
target setting.” UNICEF
Assessment (CFSVA) 2018 showed a decrease in
stunting from 38 percent in 2015 to 35 percent in
2018, i.e., 1 percent per year. The evidence of slowed progress made the Programme’s annual
reduction of 4.5 percent look quite ambitious. As a result, the target was reduced to 1.5 percent
point per year (to reduce stunting from 38 percent to 32 percent by end of 2021).
42. The targets for impact level indicators (reduction in stunting and young child’s holistic development)
were set at the national level (for 30 districts) while the Programme interventions were targeted in
14 districts. The Programme did not use the baseline numbers for stunting from each district
(conducted in 2019) to develop/add district-specific targets.
43. The KII respondents shared of their satisfaction of the process applied for target setting. Key
informants suggested that targets were set at the design stage after consultative meetings with
them and the district authorities. Moreover, annual work plans were produced through consultations
with the relevant stakeholders, which also included timelines and budgets.
EQ4.3 – How successful was DHCR in building public sector (in nutrition and ECD) and community
capacities for efficacious nutrition and ECD services for children 0-6?
The Programme had a considered focus on building public sector and community capacities for
improved and sustained nutrition and ECD services for children aged 0-6 years. The findings for this
sub-question are divided into two parts where the first outlines the public sector capacity development
achievements and later highlights community level capacity development. It should be noted that
findings below overlap and complement those listed for sustainability (where the focus in sustainability
is on continuity of services), hence should be read in conjunction with the section on sustainability.
Public Sector Capacity Development
The Programme contributed to building public sector capacity. The evaluation team has used the
enabling environment model/framework80 (five components: policy and strategy; institutional
arrangements and coordination; financing and budgeting; monitoring and evaluation; and capacity-
building) for assessment of public sector capacity development for delivery of effective implementation
of multi-sectoral interventions. Find below the matrix that outlines the key achievements vis-à-vis public
sector capacity development.
Table 10: Key Achievements vis-à-vis Public Sector Capacity Development
Enabling Key Achievements
Environment
Framework
Policy and Strategy • UNICEF supported the establishment of multiple policies and strategies including: National Nutrition
Policy; National ECD Strategic Plan; Made in Rwanda ECD Kit; National Kitchen Garden Toolkit; National
Food-Based Dietary Guidelines, National Adolescent Nutrition Guidelines, National Parenting Curriculum,
National Curriculum for the Community Health Workers; and the National Maternal, Infant and Young
Child Nutrition (MIYCN) package.81 These policies and strategies will continue to enable and guide GoR
to plan and deliver multi-sectoral interventions. Most of these services set local standards for service
delivery, defined institutional mandates and coordination arrangements, and set strategic priorities for the
GoR to continue to deliver quality services.
Institutional • Multi-sectoral ECD coordination mechanisms were established at national and district levels. To support
Arrangements and policy implementation, the national ECD technical working group, co-chaired by UNICEF and
Coordination MIGEPROF, was established.82 The working group enabled districts to effectively plan, coordinate and
monitor the implementation of programme activities.83
• The national ECD Sub-cluster, co-chaired by UNICEF and NCDA, enhanced coordination at national and
decentralized levels; and increased participation and integration of key thematic areas of health, nutrition,
education, WASH and protection.
• NECDP (restructured into NCDA) provided leadership and strategic direction and coordinated all key
government ministries, departments and development partners working on DHCR. NCDA is a newly

formed organisation with new staff members and organisational structure. The progress and support
provided by UNICEF to NECDP may be impeded by the new structure.84
• While the Programme utilized and supported multiple coordination platforms, primary and secondary data
reflect that the district level coordination remained weak due to high staff turnover.
Financing and • DHCR was primarily funded by EKN. Due to the Programme’s advocacy and support, ECD is part of
Budgeting annual budgets in 14 target districts.85
• UNICEF partnered with the Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Authority (RURA) to strengthen private operator
financial and commercial management by providing tools and training to RURA and private operators.
RURA is using the new reporting system, including an online reporting tool which strengthens oversight
and requires improved financial management to fulfil reporting requirements. This system is being used
nationally in all 27 rural districts.
• The Programme trained 170 government officials on nutritional governance (RBM) in 17 districts with the
highest levels of stunting. Participants were district-based officials in the fields of project monitoring and
evaluation (PM&E), Health, Nutrition, Agronomy, NECDP, WASH and Social Affairs. Although the training
was successful, primary and secondary data suggest a rapid turn-over of district officials hampered the
impact of the training.
Monitoring and • The Programme conducted joint monitoring visits (GoR and UNICEF); programme assessments
Evaluation (M&E) (baseline, mid-term review, nutrition monitoring missions, endline survey) and national surveys (DHS
2019-2020; CFSVA 2018; ethnographic study) to generate evidence for informed decision making.
• UNICEF strengthened the capacity of 3,030 district, sector and cell staff to promote and monitor
household sanitation.
• A monitoring and evaluation system has been established in all 14 targeted districts including
development of a child rights-based monitoring database, which includes baseline data for ECD-nutrition
multisectoral interventions. For real-time monitoring, the database is updated on a quarterly basis.
Capacity-Building • 40 master trainers were trained on the MYICN package. Master trainers then trained 633 trainers from all
health centres.
• 647 ECD caregivers (425 female and 222 male) were trained.
• Sector education officers (440), pre-service teachers (556), and ECE tutors (225), were trained on early
learning.
• 170 government officials were trained on nutrition governance.
• KII respondents expressed their satisfaction with the Programme’s capacity-building initiatives. However,
a major constraint to efficacy of this component remained the high turnover reported at the district level.
This may impede the gains achieved by the DHCR during its implementation.
Community Capacity Development:
Although the Programme laid adequate focus on community mobilisation and capacity development,
there was not a documented strategy and plan. To respond to the question and consolidate findings,
the evaluation team applied a multi-dimensional framework to assess effectiveness of community
capacity development. The key components of the framework include: 1) Community
mobilisation/organization and linkage-building; 2) Knowledge and skills development; 3) Material
assistance; 4) Monitoring and social accountability. Find below the matrix that outlines the key
achievements across these three components.
Table 11: Key Achievements vis a vis Community Capacity Development
Capacity- Building Key Achievements
Components
Community • The Programme contributed to community mobilization by supporting groups for parents, caregivers,
mobilisation and community members and ECD centre caregivers. The Programme laid focus on creating linkages such
building linkages as training on smart spending curriculum in the community-based savings groups to promote members'
prioritization of resources to improve nutrition.
• Through the partnership with religious networks, 19,171 people were reached with stunting reduction
messages. 136,708 people reached through gatherings in places of worship.
• Social mobilisation efforts through theatre for development reached 157,650 people. Sixty performances
were completed by local theatres and ten theatre performances were conducted by Urunana DC celebrity
actors to create demand for ECD around tea plantations in six districts.
• A total of 189,221 families with children (0-6 years) were reached with behaviour change communication
messages on responsive caregiving. This was implemented through direct outreach to families via faith-
based organizations and a radio programme called “Itetero” and a local community theatre called

“Urunana”. As a result, more families are aware of the importance of early investment in life of children
and the negative effects of stunting on child growth and development.
• Discussions with community members show that most of the members benefitted from the social
mobilization efforts with improved knowledge, awareness and practices around nutrition, WASH and early
education.
Knowledge and Skill • The Programme conducted various skill development initiatives namely, kitchen gardening, nutritious food
Development cooking, childcare and learning.
• The Programme invested in the training of caregivers (500) and tea pickers (70 percent female and 30
percent male) on childcare and development. The Programme capacitated 956 latrine builders by
providing training on construction that has ultimately supported communities in improving sanitation.
• DHCR supported a training-of-trainers on the national Kitchen Garden Programme and subsequent
cascade training down to village level in the 14 target districts reaching 6,726 farmer promoters and 416
youth volunteers.
• The Programme supported several districts in establishing community-based saving and lending (SILC)
groups which allow community members to access micro-loans to support income generating activities.
• 21,111 parents enrolled in the ECD programme which trained parents on skills and knowledge for
providing nurturing and responsive care to their children.
Materials Assistance • Data on quantity of different supplies provided to the community members is not available to the evaluation
team, therefore it would not be possible to provide any commentary on it. However, the Programme
provided material assistance to the community under various interventions such as ready-to-use
therapeutic food (RUTF) for treatment of SAM without complications, MNPs supplements to be distributed
amongst children 6-23 months for anemia prevention.
• Children attending programme supported ECD centres were provided with food, books and toys.
• Programme assisted farmers were provided with fruits, seeds, chickens (eggs were used for children) and
fertilizers. Discussions with farmers indicate that crop yield has increased in the past five years and the
reason for the increase in the yield was the provision of new seeds and the use of modern fertilizers.
Monitoring and • Discussions with community members indicate that routine monitoring was conducted by health workers
Social Accountability (for identification, registration and treatment of malnourished children and pregnant and lactating women
(PLW), however there is no evidence of direct involvement of community in these monitoring activities. In
addition, awareness on availability of a feedback mechanism is limited in community members.
EQ5 – To what extent has DHCR been planned and implemented in a coordinated manner,
challenges faced, and to what extent is DHCR replicable?
The criterion has one key question and one sub-question.
EQ5.1 – Has DHCR been planned and implemented in a cohesive and effective manner? What
coordination mechanisms were in place, constraints faced, and which aspects are replicable?
The description below must be read in conjunction with findings in section 4.2 (coherence). The findings
in coherence were focused on outlining the systems and processes applied for external coordination,
however here the focus is on how effective those mechanisms have been in enabling coordinated
planning and delivery, and the challenges it faced. The findings are grouped at both national and sub-
national levels that enabled cohesive planning and implementation.
DHCR Coordination Arrangements
Find below the matrix that outlines national and sub-national coordination forums either formed or
strengthened (those existed earlier) to enable cohesive planning and implementation of DHCR
activities. The section further outlines the constraints faced and how those affected synchronized
planning and implementation.
Table 12: DHCR Coordination Forums and Contributions
Coordination Key Findings
Forums / Levels
National Level • The Nutrition Technical Working Group (NTWG) was set up in 2013 (before DHCR) and continued to act as a
multisectoral coordination platform for nutrition. Under DHCR, UNICEF coordinated and supported the NTWG
that included other components like WASH, child protection and early childhood development.
• NECDP was mandated to coordinate and implement ECD, WASH and nutrition activities. These were
previously the responsibility of Rwanda Biomedical Centre. NECDP was later transformed into NCDA.
• Coordination with CSOs engaged in nutrition activities was enhanced by supporting the SUN Civil Society
Alliance in Rwanda.
• To support policy implementation, the national ECD technical working group, co-chaired by UNICEF and
MIGEPROF, was established. GoR also established a National ECD Programme Coordination Structure under
MIGEPROF to oversee stunting reduction and ECD programme implementation.
Endline Evaluation of the Developing Human Capital in Rwanda (DHCR) Programme 34
Table 12: DHCR Coordination Forums and Contributions
Coordination Key Findings
Forums / Levels
• The national ECD sub-cluster, co-chaired by UNICEF and NCDA, enhanced coordination at national and
decentralized levels; and increased participation and integration of key thematic areas of health, nutrition,
education, WASH and protection.
• Constraints: Discussions with key stakeholders indicate that frequent restructuring of institutions (particularly
of NECDP to NCDA) have had impact on institutional mandate and reporting lines, and resulted in delays and
impeded the efficacy of DHCR interventions.
Sub-National • To support DHCR implementation, district-based committees for elimination of malnutrition were established
Level in 14 districts. The Programme contributed to strengthening the capacities of these committees by enhancing
their skills around planning, monitoring and implementation of results-based programs for improved results.
Eventually, District Plans for Elimination of Malnutrition (DPEM) were formed in all 14 districts.
• At the district level, multi-sectoral coordination mechanisms or platforms were established (under MIGEPROF)
for planning, coordination, monitoring and implementation of stunting reduction and ECD programmes and are
functional in all 14 targeted districts. In 2019, ECD became part of annual budgets of the targeted 14 districts.
• Joint Action Development Forums (JADF) were established under DHCR implementation. These forums serve
as a place for joint planning or to have technical discussions among partners and CSOs to avoid duplication
of efforts and efficient use of funds and resources.
• UNICEF supported the operationalization of monitoring and evaluation systems in all 14 targeted districts with
baseline and endline assessment of key indicators in nutrition, WASH, ECD and social protection sectors.
• Constraints: The stakeholders identified frequent staff changes/turnover (as staff in key departments may
stay for few months in a role) as a limiting factor. This required repeated investments in introducing programme
interventions to new staff and loss of training investment when staff moved out of the district.
Preliminary Conclusions: Effectiveness
EFF 1: The effectiveness measurement remains inconclusive due to the fact that out of seven outcomes, only three could be rated for
relative effectiveness. For four outcomes i.e., 1, 3, 6 and 7, either data is not available for some indicators or for some i.e. 7, there are
no targets to compare performance data with. Out of the remaining three outcomes, two outcomes (i.e., 4 and 5) are assessed as
‘Fully Achieved’ and outcome 2 is rated as ‘Mostly Achieved’.
EFF 2: The evaluation team has compared the baseline (2019) with the endline (2022) to assess the relative effectiveness of
programme components i.e., nutrition, health, ECD, WASH and social protection. From the 46 indicators assessed as part of the
endline (for seven districts), the evaluation concludes that the Programme is ‘Partially Effective’. In 46 indicators, the evaluation found
incremental change in 28 indicators (61 percent) covering mostly WASH and health components. There are 18 indicators (39 percent
of the total) where the evaluation noted declining trends. The plausible explanation is COVID-19 and its impact on incomes, poverty
and restricted mobility. The indicators where the comparison shows decrease, merit further exploration.
EFF 3: The key enablers for the Programme are: alignment with GoR priorities resulting in ownership and commitment of public sector
partners; use of community-based models (community-driven) resulting in community engagement and ownership; adaptive measures
taken during COVID-19. The disabling factors that hindered achievements include institutional changes (NECDP becoming NCDA);
frequent public sector staff turnover (in districts); and COVID-19 disruptions and restrictions.
EFF 4: The Programme is largely a success in strengthening public sector and packaging as integrated services. As part of system
strengthening efforts, the Programme appears to be relatively more successful (or effective) with respect to two elements (out of five)
of Enabling Environment i.e., policy and strategy (supported GoR to develop multiple policies and strategies) and monitoring and
evaluation (supported GoR to conduct national surveys and improve nutritional governance). The Programme remained partially
successful in terms of: capacity-building (undermined by high staff turnover reported at the district level); financing and budgeting (for
limited focus); and institutional arrangements and coordination (stakeholders reported gaps in district level coordination).
EFF 5: The Programme remained effective in community mobilization and capacity development. The community capacity
development is assessed with respect to community mobilization and linkages development; skills and knowledge development;
materials assistance; and monitoring and social accountability. The Programme successes are evident in organizing communities (for
collective actions); wider community participation and engagement; leveraging influence of local influencers, i.e., religious leaders,
theatres, faith-based organizations; and provision of skills and supplies. All these factors contributed to cultivating ownership and
mobilizing community for collective benefit.
EFF 6: The Programme has been effective in terms of taking a methodical approach to mapping external stakeholders and using this
information to organize new forums for stakeholder coordination. Moreover, it also worked to strengthen the existing forums. Where
these forums enabled cohesive planning and implementation, these faced challenges around frequent changes in government-led
coordination structures and their mandates at the national level. This caused confusion amongst stakeholders and impaired joint
planning of activities. At the district level, high turnover of district officials affected sub-national coordination.
4.5 Impact
EQ6 – To what extent did the Programme contribute to achieving the desired impact?
The impact criterion has one key evaluation question and one sub-question.
EQ6.1 – Did DHCR contribute to the achievement of intended impacts (in stunting reduction and
developmental readiness of 0-6 children) in target districts and in the country?
Endline Evaluation of the Developing Human Capital in Rwanda (DHCR) Programme 35
The findings are divided into two parts, whereby the first part presents findings on contributions to the
intended impact and the second highlights the unintended impact.
Programme’s Contributions to Intended Impact
The Programme intended to contribute to following impact targets for children (under 6):
I. Impact 1: Prevalence of stunting among children U5 reduced
II. Impact 2: Young children's holistic development improved
Find below the Programme contributions to the achievement of two impact indicators.
Impact 1: Reduction in stunting among children U5
44. The Programme’s revised target86 to reduce national stunting was from 38 percent to 32 percent
(decrease by 6 percent) by the end of 2021. The national data suggests that stunting rates have
come down from 38 percent (RDHS 2014-2015) to 33 percent (RDHS 2019-2020).87 The
Programme may have contributed to the reduced national stunting rate due to nutrition-specific and
nutrition-sensitive interventions in 14 target districts. District level stunting data is not available in
the RDHS, and the evaluation team has used primary data for baseline and endline comparison.
45. For programme districts, the evaluation team undertook comparative analysis of the Programme’s
baseline (undertaken in 2019) and endline survey (undertaken as part of the evaluation in 2022).
Comparisons were done for seven target districts to assess the Programme’s contributions to
reduce stunting among children aged 6-23 months. Data shows that the prevalence of stunting has
decreased by 1.6 percent from the baseline value of 31.3 percent (95 percent CI: 29.0 percent –
33.6 percent) to an endline value of 29.7 percent (95 percent CI: 27.18 percent – 32.38 percent).88
This demonstrates lower achievement for programme districts (in comparison to national-level
stunting reduction), which begs further exploration. The baseline and endline numbers for each
target district are mentioned below:

Overall 1552 485 31.30% 1352 402 29.70%
46. To corroborate these findings a paired t-test was undertaken to assess whether significant
difference exists between baseline and endline data. The range for stunting within programme
districts at baseline with 95 percent confidence interval was: [30.73 percent, 35.76 percent];
whereas at endline the same confidence interval89 it was: [26.96 percent, 32.66 percent]. Hence an
average difference/reduction of 3.4 percent has been determined.
47. Similarly, to further validate the existence of significant difference between baseline and endline
stunting data, we have used the hypothesis that stunting rate is reduced up to 4 percent
(𝐻 :𝑆𝑡𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒 ≤ 4%) valid with P-Value 0.001 for one sided left tail hypothesis. The

difference in stunting rate within seven programme districts between endline and baseline, using
95 percent Confidence Interval, was: [-4.7 percent, 2.8 percent). Hence, the stunting rate has been
reduced up to 4.7 percent (valid with P-value less than 0.05).
48. Geographically, the highest prevalence of overall stunting was reported in Rutsiro with 40.2 percent
of sampled children stunted, followed by Burera, at 39.9 percent. Three out of seven districts
reported an increase in prevalence of stunting including Gatsibo, Gicumbi and Nyarguru from their

Endline Evaluation of the Developing Human Capital in Rwanda (DHCR) Programme 36
baseline values. In comparison, four other districts saw a decrease in the prevalence of stunting
including Burera, Karongi, Ngororero and Rutsiro. The evaluation team did not find any evidence
to explain the upward trend in prevalence of stunting in half of the districts which may require further
exploration.
49. In both baseline and endline surveys, a similar trend is reported where boys (35.3 percent in 2019
and 21.6 percent in 2022) were more likely to be stunted than girls (27.2 percent in 2019 and 19.4
percent in 2022). This is partially explained by cultural practices where girls are more likely to stay
home and the uptake of food/number of meals is higher as compared to boys.
50. Discussions with stakeholders and community members corroborated the findings that the
Programme contributed to reducing the rate of stunting at national level. In addition to reduction in
stunting, the stakeholders also highlighted that there has been a positive impact on knowledge,
attitudes and behaviour of parents and caregivers. This was done by providing frequent mobilization
sessions to equip them with knowledge and capacities.
Impact 2: Improvement in Young Children’s Holistic Development
51. For the holistic development impact indicator (for children aged 36-59 months), the numbers
indicate an incremental trend. Against the baseline number of 63 percent (RDHS 2014-2015 among
children aged 36-59 months), the RDHS 2019-2020 shows that number at 76 percent (among
children aged 24-59 months). Due to difference of age intervals between RDHS 2014-2015 and
RDHS 2019-2020, these two values are not comparable.
52. For programme districts, the data comparison is available for selected (not all) holistic development
factors/indicators (between the programme baseline (2019) and evaluation endline (2022). The
trend analysis indicates that for most early stimulation activities (by caregivers) there is
improvement in numbers, with exception of taking the child outside, which can be explained by the
restrictions imposed due to COVID-19 (percentage dropped from 76.1 percent to 28.4 percent).
Figure 20 below shows the comparison between endline and baseline on different types of early
stimulation activities.

53. Figure 21 below shows role of mothers and fathers in child development activities. Fathers were
reported to be involved in telling stories and playing with children.

Programme’s Contributions to Unintended Impact
54. Stakeholders referred to positive changes in parenting and in particular the involvement of
father/men in responsible parenting. The community respondents referred to a shift in men’s
behaviour, whereby they are more inclined to invest in saving groups and use the money for their
family’s well-being, instead of spending it on alcohol consumption (which was a dominant behaviour
prior to programming).
Preliminary Conclusions: Impact
IMP 1: The Programme may have contributed to impact achievement of stunting reduction (U5). The national stunting numbers
indicate reduction from 38 percent to 33 percent (from 2015-2020), which equals the Programme target of achieving 5 percent
reduction in stunting rates nationally (please note that target was revised downwards after midterm review of DHCR). In addition, this
measurement is for the national level whereas the Programme was implemented in 14 of the 30 districts. For Programme districts
however, the numbers show a reduction of 1.6 percent (in 7 out of 14 programme districts – for 6-23 months) between 2019-2022.
The lower results for programme districts (in comparison to national numbers) beg further enquiry.
IMP 2: For the second impact indicator, the child holistic development was at 63 percent (RDHS 2014-2015 – among 36-59 months)
to 76 percent (RDHS 2019-2020, 24-59 months). Due to variation in age group in both RDHS, comparison between the two values is
not possible. For programme districts, comparison remains incomplete (for all indicators that make up holistic development) for
baseline (2019) and endline evaluation survey (2022), however for most of these factors there is an upward trend in uptake of early
stimulation activities.
IMP 3: The unintended impact is evident in terms of improvement in the involvement of fathers in child development activities including
shift in behaviour to save money rather than using money for personal expenses.

The findings are structured into two parts whereby the first part lists DHCR strategies/interventions and
results that are likely to be sustainable or otherwise, including the contributory factors. The second part
dwells upon the likelihood of securing more funds from current/new donors (for continuation of nutrition
and ECD activities) keeping in view programme achievements.
Sustainability of Programme Interventions and Results
This section puts together the findings (and to a degree analysis) of activities and results that may be
sustainable or otherwise. The findings are drawn from both primary and secondary data and are
presented in a matrix form. It should be noted that the Programme operated without a documented
exit/sustainability plan. In the absence of a plan, the evaluation team has used the Programme’s
strategies and results that are likely or unlikely to be sustainable and their contributory factors.

Future Funding Scenario
55. The DHCR supported various interventions under components including nutrition, ECD, WASH,
social protection and education. Desk review indicates multiple initiatives by UNICEF, WFP, FAO,
WHO and World Bank that warrant continuity of key Programme interventions.
56. For instance, for nutrition, multiple development partners including Clinton Health Access Initiative,
Inc., Foreign Commonwealth Development Office, Japan International Cooperation Agency,
UNICEF, USAID, WFP and World Health Organisation will continue to work in Rwanda around

nutrition-specific and sensitive interventions and approaches from 2021 to 2023.91 In addition,
GoR’s commitment and ownership is evident as the budget allocations to different nutrition-related
interventions have increased from FRW 8.4 billion in 2017/18 to FRW 47.8 billion in 2021/22.92
57. In addition, UNICEF, WHO, FAO and WFP are implementing Joint Nutrition Project Phase III (July
2021- June 2025) in Rutsiro and Ngororero districts (both DHCR districts) which aims to support
the GoR’s efforts to reduce stunting in Rwanda.93
58. Desk review indicates that the World Bank is implementing various initiatives for developing human
capital mainly around health, education, social protection, agriculture and multi-sectoral human
capital support for: i) prevention and reduction of child stunting; ii) supporting policy and institutional
reforms related to the delivery and coverage of human capital related services (education, social
protection, health and early childhood development); iii) strengthening the social protection
programs and delivery systems and to improve access of poor and vulnerable households to human
capital and economic inclusion services.94 Refer to Appendix 32 for more details.
59. ECD, as indicated in previous sections, has transformed into GoR’s main development priorities,
and it remained part of the annual budgets of all target districts.
60. Social protection budget depicts an increasing trend over the past five years, from FRW 79.4 billion
in 2016/17 to FRW 198 billion in 2020/21. About two percent of GDP is allocated to non-
contributory social protection interventions, which is consistent with that spent on similar social
protection programs in other developing countries. As a share of the total national budget, the social
protection budget increased from 4.1 percent to 6.1 percent during the same period. The increasing
trend in the social protection budget allocations both in real terms and as a share of GDP indicates
the government’s commitment to strengthen and expand social protection programs to ensure
inclusive and pro-poor development.95
EQ7.2 – Has DHCR cultivated ownership and strengthened capacities within relevant public
stakeholders and how does the GoR intend to sustain programme activities (in terms of budget
allocation, policy, planning, implementation, management and monitoring)?
61. The evaluation team has applied the enabling environment framework comprised of five elements
essential for building public sector capacities. The subsequent section should be read in conjunction
with findings included under effectiveness (section 4.4).
• Policy and Strategy: The Programme assisted GoR in developing relevant policy frameworks
(National Nutrition Policy, National ECD Strategic Plan, Made in Rwanda ECD Kit, National
Food-Based Dietary Guidelines). These policies showcase GoR’s commitment to provide
evidence-based guidance to direct future implementation of nutrition and ECD interventions.
• Institutional Arrangements and Coordination: Institutional embedding of DHCR
interventions lay with NCDA—a newly formed body with a new structure and human resources.
This is a potential danger for the embedding of DHCR and its interventions where NCDA is still
developing the new structure. Similarly, the Programme has utilised and contributed to
strengthening several coordination platforms (national ECD technical working group, national
ECD sub-cluster, SUN network, among others). As discussed under section 4.4, the efficacy of
the district-level coordination system is limited and requires continued support in the future.
• Financing and Budgeting: The Programme was funded by the EKN and by the end of
implementation, the GoR, donors and multilateral organisations (such as World Bank) have
taken up funding of multiple interventions. There is a continued need for advocacy for
replication and upscaling of DHCR activities in other districts.
• M&E: The Programme conducted joint monitoring visits (GoR and UNICEF); Programme
assessments (baseline, mid-term review, nutrition monitoring missions, endline survey) and
national surveys (DHS 2019-2020; CFSVA 2018; ethnographic study) to generate evidence for
informed decision-making. These studies, to a degree, remained under-utilised during
implementation, and it is unclear how GoR plans to benefit from programme-supported M&E
activities in the future.
• Capacity-Building: DHCR paid much attention to capacity development of national and
subnational government staff in order to promote nutrition governance at all levels. DPEMs play
an essential role in combatting both acute and chronic malnutrition at the district levels, in line

with national policy. The capacity building requires continued support which various
interventions (as indicated in future funding sub section) intend to support in target districts.
Preliminary Conclusions: Sustainability
SUS 1: The Programme operated without a documented sustainability/exit plan; hence the evaluation team is unable to comment on
success around its implementation. From the data, it appears that programme strategies of evidence generation (with availability of
requisite data for future interventions) and PPPs (commitment by private companies to continue supporting ECD centres) show higher
prospects of sustainability. Whereas strategies such as capacity-building, dialogue and advocacy, and cross-sectoral linkages are
relatively less likely to be sustainable due continued need for implementation with no commitment from GoR or any other development
partner to implement them. The Programme has seen limited success with mobilising other donors to contribute to the Programme’s
continuity and the Programme is currently not being implemented as EKN II funding is finished.
SUS 2: There is evident interest and willingness by the GoR agencies to continue and replicate the Programme which has translated
into securing additional public sector financial commitment for DHCR components (such as nutrition, ECD and social protection).
Initiatives by UN agencies and World Bank show that the development partners are committed to continue supporting GoR in reducing
stunting and improving holistic in Rwanda.
4.7 HRBA, Gender Equality and Equity
EQ8 – To what extent did DHCR incorporate human rights-based/child rights approaches
(HRBA/CR), gender equality, and equity principles and approaches, and results created
thereof?
To demonstrate a concerted focus on evaluating integration (in terms of the Programme’s design and
implementation) of cross cutting priorities (for UNICEF), a separate criterion has been added with
includes assessment of HRBA, gender equality and equity. There is one key question with three sub-
questions, one each for the three cross-cutting priorities.
EQ8.1 – Did DHCR (design and implementation) incorporate the HRBA/CR principles?
This section brings together findings and analysis around the Programme’s compliance with the HRBA96
principles i.e., Participation, Accountability, Non-Discrimination and Equality, Empowerment and
Legality (often referred to as PANEL). The findings are corroborated by both secondary and primary
data.
Integration of HRBA in DHCR Design and Implementation
Following is the evaluation team’s assessment on DHCR’s compliance with key HRBA principles.
Table 15: DHCR Compliance with HRBA principles
HRBA Principles Findings and Evaluation Team’s Assessment
Participation97 The Programme’s design and implementation remained inclusive. First a broad-based consultative process
(featuring bi-lateral meetings, stakeholder consultation workshops and government validation meetings) was
taken to inform programme design. Key public sector partners (including district administrations) were engaged
to identify overlaps and avoid duplication. Communities were consulted and involved in the identification of
problems and solutions (in the form of FGDs), which influenced programme design. A range of community
groups—religious volunteers, community volunteers, ECD animateurs, community mobilizers, religious
leaders—participated in sensitisation activities as agents for change.
Accountability98 The document review does not point to programme-led community feedback and/or a grievance management
system. Nevertheless, the communities referred to an existing practice of informing the CHWs and community
leaders of any feedback they may have, which continued to be practised through DHCR.
Non- The interventions remained largely non-discriminatory (did not discriminate based on identity factors) with the
discrimination and exception of prioritisation of households/beneficiaries on the basis of Ubudehe.100 While this positive
Equality99 discrimination towards more vulnerable households is useful, discussions with community members indicate
instances of exclusion of some deserving households that did meet criteria for inclusion. In addition, community
members shared that concentrated focus was not paid to disabled and teenage/single mothers.
Empowerment101 The Programme enabled improved knowledge and awareness among community members around causes of
stunting and delayed child development and has empowered them to make better choices. The community-led

is a function of one’s income, personal possessions and general quality of life.
101 Empowerment: Everyone is entitled to claim and exercise their rights. Individuals and communities need to understand their rights and participate in the
development of policies which affect their lives.

structures have created ownership and empowered communities to plan and address issues around malnutrition
and child development.
Legality102 The Programme draws legal basis from the children rights enshrined in CRC 1989103 (that GoR is signatory) and
other legal instruments safeguarding child development and access to services. Moreover, the legality is evident
from the Programme’s compliance with GoR sectoral policies and plans including National ECD Policy (2016)
and National Nutrition and Food Policy Objectives (2014).
EQ8.2 – Does programme design and implementation reflect integration of gender equality?
This description presents key findings around the integration of gender equality at design and
implementation levels. A light touch analysis of the integration of UN System-wide Action Plan (UN-
SWAP) on Gender Equality and Empowerment of Women (GEEW),104 has been incorporated.
Integration of Gender Equality in DHCR Design and Implementation
This sub-section informs highlights how gender-based assessment informed the Programme’s design
and implementation. In addition, the section includes viewpoints on how the Programme has
beneficiated both genders and to what extent the causes of inequality between boys and girls have
been addressed.
Design Stage
62. A Programme-supported gender assessment was not undertaken to inform its design. However,
the Programme leveraged the findings of the Gender Equity Assessment of the VUP Programme
(2012); Nutrition, Markets and Gender Survey (2016); and RDHS (2014-2015). In addition, it carried
consultative sessions with stakeholders (public and communities) to understand gender (age and
sex related) needs and barriers and thus the interventions were designed in consideration.
63. The barriers identified across gender equality included: (i) more stunting in children from HHs that
have open defecation systems; (ii) opportunities for women are often limited to hard physical work
that can be harmful to breastfeeding mothers with young children; (iii) time burden on women also
translates into increased rates of stunting; (iv) women who spend more time in agriculture are less
likely to breastfeed their children.
64. Review of the Programme’s financial statements does not reflect separate expenditures for gender-
specific results. In addition, the Programme results framework do not provide gender-disaggregated
targets (or achievements) for relevant indicators.
Implementation Stage
65. The programme implementation included gender-sensitive interventions. For instance, both male
and female community members were sensitized on the importance of improving nutrition,
breastfeeding, better hygiene practices, etc. Furthermore, the programme supported the
construction of gender-segregated toilets and promotion and inclusion of female participation in
capacity-building initiatives addressed the specific needs of women and girls. The setting up of ECD
centres by tea companies resulted in mothers working for more hours (without having to worry about
children), which in turn boosted their income.
66. As the Programme did not collect gender-disaggregated data, the evaluation team is unable to
assess the progress/results achieved. Comparison of the results of the baseline (2019) and endline
(2022) underscore that the prevalence of stunting in children aged 6-23 months decreased,
although it is higher for boys (35.3 percent in 2019 and 21.6 percent in 2022) than girls (27.2 percent
in 2019 and 19.4 percent in 2022) in the targeted districts. This is partially explained by cultural
practices where girls are more likely to stay home and the uptake of food/number of meals is higher
as compared to boys.
67. An improvement in participation of fathers in child development activities was reported. An endline
evaluation (2020) in 10 UNICEF-supported districts showed that 63.3 percent of children have
fathers engaged in activities that promote their learning and school readiness compared to 57
percent at baseline (2017).
68. The evaluation team has reviewed the Programme’s results framework to assess if the design
incorporated gender equality principles as per the UN-SWAP 2.0.105 There are 17 indicators broadly
divided under results-based management: oversight; accountability; human and financial
resources; capacity; and knowledge, communication and coherence. Of the six indicators that the
evaluation team was able to assess, the Programme was found to be compliant on three indicators

and non-compliant on other three. Refer to Appendix 33 which includes gender equality indicators
and the evaluation team’s assessment of the Programme’s compliance and non-compliance with
those indicators.
EQ8.3 – To what extent did DHCR appropriately assess, identify and address the needs of
vulnerable groups (including vulnerable girls and boys aged 0-6 years); are there any groups that
are not covered by the Programme?
This description presents key findings around the integration of equity at design, implementation and
results.
Integration of Equity in DHCR Design, Implementation and Results
This sub-section informs whether DHCR undertook an equity assessment to inform targets,
interventions and resource allocations and includes a discussion on how the Programme has benefited
vulnerable groups and to what extent the causes of inequity have been addressed.

Preliminary Conclusions: HRBA, GE and Equity
HRBA 1: Programme design and implementation is found largely consistent with HRBA principles. Consistency with the principle of
participation is evident at varied levels, such as engagement of rights-holders, duty-bearers and influencers. The Programme is found
to be largely non-discriminatory with exception of exclusion of deserving families who were excluded from programme services for not
meeting the Ubudehe criteria/rating. The Programme-supported feedback and grievance management system is unavailable. However,
the communities can refer complaints to CHWs and local leaders. The Programme is consistent with local laws and international rights
conventions.
GE 1: The Programme is found to be partially compliant to gender equality. The Programme design offers limited gender disaggregation,
as no indicator calls for collection of gender disaggregated data (impact, outcome or output indicators). Moreover, the Programme
design did not conduct a gender assessment but utilised secondary evidence to inform its design. The Programme implementation is
assessed as gender responsive as both male and female community members were sensitised on promoted behaviour; gender-
segregated toilets were built in schools to address the needs of women and girls; female participation increased in committees and
capacity-building initiatives; setting up of ECD centres by tea companies promoted work-life balance (women could work without having
to worry about children). Results from the evaluation endline survey underscore that while the prevalence of stunting in children aged
6-23 months decreased, it still continues to be higher for boys than girls in the targeted districts [21.6 percent (boys) and 19.4 percent
(girls)].
EQY 1: The Programme is found to be mostly compliant with equity principles. The Programme’s geographical targeting was based on
equity parameters including prevalence of stunting, poverty rates, household food insecurity and access to improved drinking water and
improved sanitation. Mostly, the interventions remained non-discriminatory; however, beneficiary prioritisation was done on the basis of
Ubudehe (categorisation) which requires revisiting as in some cases deserving HHs did not receive benefits as they were incorrectly
categorised. More interventions are needed for people with disabilities, and teenage mothers and their children also were not prioritized
for the interventions.

Chapter 5: Conclusions, Lessons Learnt and Recommendations
This chapter comprises three sections i.e., conclusions, lessons learnt and recommendations. The first
section lists evaluation conclusions drawn primarily from the findings and preliminary conclusions. The
second section outlines the key lessons learnt (including good practices) framed as such to demonstrate
replicability across sectors and similar contexts. The last section lists evaluation recommendations.
5.1 Conclusions
Find below evaluation conclusions that synthesize preliminary conclusions for each evaluation criterion.
Relevance: The Programme is concluded to be relevant for addressing priority needs – stunting and
holistic child development and addressing both supply and demand side bottlenecks. There are evident
overlaps (in terms of programme outcomes and strategies) with GoR public sector policies and plans,
hence is concluded to be consistent or coherent with GoR’s sectoral priorities. Use of the multi-variable
child deprivation framework enabled effective and equitable targeting of districts.
Coherence: The Programme design managed to leverage internal coherence (within UNICEF);
however only limited evidence is available on how successful the Programme has been in leveraging
comparative strengths of multiple UNICEF sections during implementation. The Programme is
concluded to have taken a systematic approach (featuring mapping exercises and
forming/strengthening collaborative forums) to bring together actors across different sectors, which
enabled leveraging resources of different actors and avoiding duplication. The Programme
demonstrated successful implementation of public-private partnership (via engagement of tea
companies for ECD), and it merits continuity and scale-up.
Effectiveness: The effectiveness measurement remains inconclusive due to data limitations. Out of
seven outcomes, only three could be rated for relative effectiveness. From these, two outcomes (i.e., 4
and 5) are assessed as ‘Fully Achieved’ and outcome 2 is rated as ‘Mostly Achieved’.106 The evaluation
assessed the Programme’s effectiveness by offering a comparison between the baseline (2019) and
endline (2022) on selected aspects across different components (Nutrition, Health, ECD, WASH and
Social Protection). The evaluation team concludes that the Programme is ‘Partially Effective’ on 46
indicators assessed as part of the evaluation. A positive change in 28 indicators was reported (mostly
covering WASH and Health components), whereas the remaining 18 indicators show a declining trend.
Possible explanation of mildly encouraging results is COVID-19 and its associated economic impact on
communities, however this merits further enquiry.
The Programme’s achievements are the result of a few enabling factors, which include: i) alignment
with GoR priorities resulting in ownership and commitment of public sector partners; ii) use of
community-based models (community driven) resulting in community engagement and ownership; and
iii) adaptive measures taken during COVID-19. Some disabling factors were identified as institutional
changes (NECDP mandate transferred to NCDA); frequent public sector staff turnover (in districts); and
COVID-19 disruptions and restrictions. The Programme has been largely effective in strengthening the
public sector especially with respect to policy and strategy (supported GoR to develop relevant polices
and strategies) and monitoring and evaluation (supported to improve nutritional governance). It
remained relatively less effective in terms of capacity-building (hampered by high turnover of district
officials); financing and budgeting (for limited focus) and institutional arrangements and coordination
(institutional restructuring and changes in mandates). The Programme remained effective in community
mobilization and capacity development that contributed to cultivating ownership with respect to
organizing communities (for collective actions); wider community participation and engagement;
leveraging influence of local influencers, i.e., religious leaders, theatres, faith-based organizations; and
provision of skills and supplies.
The Programme has been effective in terms of organizing and strengthening forums for stakeholder
coordination. Where these forums enabled cohesive planning and implementation, they faced
challenges around frequent changes in government-led coordination structures and their mandates at
the national level. This caused confusion amongst stakeholders and impaired joint planning of activities.
Efficiency: The evaluation team was unable to conclude on the Programme’s efficiency due data
limitation (progress not available from March– December 2021). From the numbers shared by UNICEF
(with a risk of multiple counting of beneficiaries), the Programme reached out to 8.5 million beneficiaries
(against a target of 0.5 million) while using only 79 percent of funds begs the question of appropriate
targeting. Given the Programme’s focus on nutrition and ECD, the allocation of over 55 percent of

of intended targets achieved.
Endline Evaluation of the Developing Human Capital in Rwanda (DHCR) Programme 45
resources to these two components justifies the allocation of resources. The cost/beneficiary of $2.05
looks reasonable as it is lesser than the planned cost ($2.65).
Impact: The Programme intended to contribute to stunting reduction and child holistic development.
For stunting, programme targeted reduction in stunting (in U5) by 6 percent at the national level (target
reduced after MTE), which it may have contributed to the national numbers that came down from 38
percent (RDHS 2014-2015) to 33 percent (RDHS 2019-2020). It should be noted that the Programme
was implemented in 14 out of 30 total districts. The Programme’s baseline (2019) and endline (2022)
comparison (for 6-23 months) in seven programme districts indicates an overall decrease of 1.6 percent
i.e., average reduction from 31.3 percent to 29.7 percent. This national vs programme district data
indicates lower impact in programme districts, which merits further enquiry. Child holistic development
has improved from 63 percent (RDHS 2014-2015 – among 36-59 months) to 76 percent (RDHS 2019-
2020, 24-59 months), however, due to variation in age group in RDHS, comparison between the two
values is not possible. The data for impact measurement for programme districts is incomplete, however
the evaluation team noted a positive change for most of the contributing factors to holistic development
(covered in the evaluation endline survey). The unintended impact is evident in terms of greater
involvement by fathers in child development and shift in behaviours to save money for improved family
nutrition over spending for personal consumption (ex. alcohol).
Sustainability: The Programme has operated without an exit plan. The design and implementation laid
adequate focus on creation of an enabling environment. The data indicates that strategies and
interventions under evidence generation and PPP have relatively higher likelihood to be sustainable
over others i.e., capacity development, dialogue and advocacy, and cross-sectoral linkages. There is
evident interest and willingness in the GoR to continue and replicate DHCR interventions which has
translated into securing additional public sector financial contribution for components including nutrition,
ECD and social protection. Initiatives by UN agencies and World Bank also highlight the development
partners commitment to continue supporting GoR in reducing stunting and improving holistic in Rwanda.
Non-DAC Criteria
HRBA: The Programme is consistent with the HRBA principles including: participation by facilitating
multi-stakeholders and multi-layered partnerships; empowerment (by enabling access to knowledge
leading to perceived sense of empowerment in community members for better food, health and child
nurturing choices); and legality (compliant with child rights provisions enshrined in international and
regional treaties). The Programme demonstrated weaker consistency with the principle of accountability
for limited opportunities for rights-holders to hold service providers accountable and non-discrimination
and equality (exclusion of some families who we not given access to programme services due to not
meeting Ubudehe criteria/rating).
Gender Equality: The evaluation team concludes that the Programme is partially compliant with gender
equality principles. At the design level, the logframe does not include any indicator that allows for gender
disaggregation and the design was not informed by a structured gender assessment. The Programme’s
implementation shows inclusion of interventions that were meant to address gender barriers. For
instance, sensitisation of both male and female community members on promoted behaviour; gender-
segregated toilets were built in schools to address the needs of women and girls; female participation
in committees and capacity-building initiatives; setting up of ECD centres by tea companies promoted
work-life balance. Results from the evaluation endline survey show that the prevalence of stunting in
children aged 6-23 months continues to be higher for boys than girls in the targeted districts.
Equity: The Programme is concluded to be mostly compliant with equity principles. A structured equity
assessment was not conducted although the Programme relied on national surveys (including RDHS
and CFSVA) to identify vulnerable districts. The logframe does not include any indicator that would
allow for equity disaggregation (rich/poor; urban/rural). The selection of target districts was driven by
equity (prevalence of stunting, poverty rates, household food insecurity, access to improved drinking
water and improved sanitation) as the targeted districts showed higher vulnerability to malnutrition and
development delays. The Programme reports reflect minimal disaggregation based on equity indicators
(rural/urban; rich/poor).
Conclusions on the way forward: The Programme has been largely successful in creating momentum
as is evident from contributions to intended impact. There is evident public sector willingness to continue
implementation which has translated into increased public sector financial contribution to DHCR
components. Still, the situation merits continued engagement of UNICEF RCO with GoR, possibly in a
different role. For UNICEF the focus must shift to policy advocacy and development of a medium to
long term road map, documentation of good practices, successes and business cases. The GoR must
continue to allocate public financial allocations to DHCR interventions. The private sector holds the key
Endline Evaluation of the Developing Human Capital in Rwanda (DHCR) Programme 46
and GoR must find ways to stimulate corporate social responsibility and incentivise businesses (through
tax breaks and other incentives) to become partners in delivery social goods. The GoR must continue
working with external stakeholders to leverage their presence and resources and strengthen community
engagement mechanisms including local coordination to sustain interest and ownership of other actors
including communities. These ideas have been crystallised into actions in the recommendations.
5.2 Lesson Learnt
Find below the key lessons learnt around design and implementation. The lessons learnt are drawn
from both primary and secondary data, with the evaluation team’s own judgement of good practices
that have come up as potentially replicable ideas. Keeping in view GEROS guidance, these are framed
as such to demonstrate their replicability across similar contexts and sectors.
1. The extensive engagement with stakeholders in programme design and rollout phases, wider
consultations and bilateral meetings have proven useful in securing inputs and fostering broader
ownership for the intervention. This has come up as a good practice and should be encouraged
for future. This remains relevant for not only for Rwanda but other developing contexts and
sectors, where multi-stakeholders’ efforts are critical for system strengthening.
2. The Programme has proven successful in using a systematic approach to map stakeholders
(through multiple exercises) and leverage information for improved external coherence. Where
the process to form/strengthen external coordination forums is apparent, the documentation of
how such forums coordinate (at multiple levels) and contribute to improved coordination across
actors and sectors, appears missing. It would be important if such exercises are documented for
the whole life cycle (process, actions and results) to benefit from documentation in future.
3. The Programme has been effective in private sector/businesses engagement for both social
impact and business continuity. The engagement with tea companies and cooperatives proved a
win-win relationship for all involved. Where it benefitted children (who stayed at ECD centres and
have had holistic access to early learning, good nutrition, hygiene and protection services), it
benefitted women and families with additional income (for being able to work for longer hours),
and businesses with happy employees willing and available to contribute more. This remains a
good practice and should be replicated in other contexts and sectors where private sector could
be encouraged to contribute to social impact.
5.3 Recommendations
Find below the evaluation recommendations drawn from the findings and conclusions. The
recommendations lay focus on shifting responsibility on to GoR to keep up the momentum of DHCR
achievements. The framing of recommendations has been done keeping in view the key actors that
have played part in the Programme design and implementation and continue to hold significance for
the future e.g., GoR and UNICEF RCO. The structure includes broader recommendations followed by
specific actions (expanding on the ‘what’ and ‘how’). To ease implementation, each action is tagged to
one or more relevant actors (as primary and secondary stakeholders) considered relevant and
responsible to take action. Moreover, each action is prioritized as either immediate, short term or
medium term.107 Where applicable, the recommended actions are referenced to specific preliminary
conclusions.
The process of developing recommendations included a series of questions (in each evaluation
instrument or tool) that asked stakeholders (UNICEF, public sector partners, donors and communities)
to understand their experiences and aspirations for the future. The recommendations were presented
to stakeholders (including ERG members) in a validation / dissemination session and the evaluation
team then incorporated stakeholder perspectives. Recommendations have also benefitted from the
expertise and experiences of the evaluation team.

Level High-Profile Professional Institution
Duration Four (4) months
Start Date From: July 2021 To: October 2021
Reporting to UNICEF Rwanda, PME
Background and Justification
Human capital development is one of the fundamental pillars contributing to any country’s socio-
economic development. As such, investment in children’s early years is critical for their growth and
development and productivity in adulthood. It is on this premise that Rwanda has prioritized
programmes for the wellbeing of children at early age. Rwanda has recently released results of key
indicators of the Demographic Health Survey (DHS 2019-2020) which shows the nutritional status of
children under age 5 according to the three anthropometric indices. The report shows that 33% of
children under the age of 5 in Rwanda are stunted. A higher proportion of children in rural areas (36%)
than urban areas (20%) are stunted. The same report reveals geographical disparities where children
in North province (41%) and West province (40%) are more likely to be stunted than the children who
live in other areas. Evidence shows that stunting is strongly correlated to mother’s education level as
well as poverty. Children of mothers with no education are more likely to be stunted than those whose
mothers have been to school. Stunting is inversely related to wealth quintile; 49% of children in the
lowest wealth quintile are stunted, as compared with 11% of children in the highest quintile.
As of 2020, only 1% of children in Rwanda are wasted and less than 1% are severely wasted. Overall,
6% of children under age 5 are overweight. The results show that 8% of all children under age 5 are
underweight and 1% are severely underweight. The proportion of children who are underweight is
greater in rural areas (9%) than urban areas (4%). Underweight is strongly associated with mothers’
education; 11% of children whose mothers have no education compared to less than 1% of children
whose mothers have more than a secondary education. Underweight is inversely related to wealth; 12%
of children in the lowest wealth quintile are underweight, as compared with 2% of children in the highest
quintile.
The same DHS 2019-2020 provides the situation of child feeding practices which contributes to the
nutritional status of children. The results show that 81% of children under age 6 months are exclusively
breastfed, this is a slight decrease from the 87% figure reported in 2014-15. Timely introduction of
complementary feeding measured among children aged 6-8 months, on the other hand, now stands at
79%, a significant improvement from 2015 when this was only 56%. Still, only 22% of children 6-23
months are receiving a minimum acceptable diet.
Despite solid progress since 2017, poverty is still widespread in Rwanda. According to the latest
Integrated Household Living Conditions Survey (EICV5), 38.2% of the population live below the national
poverty line, and 16% below the extreme poverty line. Geographically, the poverty rate fell substantially
in Kigali City, and somewhat in Northern Province, but rose in the Southern and Western provinces.
While 18% of the population lives in urban areas, only 7% of the poor reside in towns and cities, with
the remaining 93% live in rural areas. Kigali city has 13% of the total population but only 5% of the poor.
Poverty rates between 2014 and 2017 dropped insignificantly by 0.9 percentage points in total poverty
and 0.4 percentage points in extreme poverty.
Children under 18 represent 44.5 per cent of the total population in Rwanda (NISR projections, 2020).
The Multiple Overlapping Deprivations Analysis (MODA) published by UNICEF in 2018 showed that
39% of children aged 0-17 years are multi-dimensionally poor based on analyses of EICV4 and DHS5
data. Access to improved sanitation in rural and urban areas is the highest deprivation amongst children
24-59 months (64 per cent), while in the 0-23 months age group 66 per cent of children are deprived in
the nutrition dimension. Deprivations in nutrition, health and sanitation overlap significantly for children
aged 0-23 months (27 per cent) whereas children aged 24-59 months face significant overlapping
deprivations in the health, water and sanitation dimensions (20 per cent).
Endline Evaluation of the Developing Human Capital in Rwanda (DHCR) Programme 50
Short-term consequences of stunting for children include increased morbidity and mortality; decreased
cognitive, motor and language development; increased healthcare expenditures; and opportunity costs
related to the care of sick children. Long-term consequences include an increase in non-communicable
diseases, low school performance and decreased work capacity. The Baseline study for this programme
conducted in 2019 suggested that despite increasing access to certain services, the poorest households
remain disproportionately vulnerable to food insecurity, are more likely to compromise on the normal
food intake and are less likely to seek medical treatment for children when they have fever or diarrhoea
and have disproportionately high malnutrition indicators compared to the richer households included in
the study. The same study suggests that Diarrhoea is among the leading causes of death and the
leading cause of malnutrition among children under-five globally. Malnourished children and those with
impaired immunity are at highest risk of life-threatening diarrhoea. The most common interventions
deployed in prevention of diarrhoea include safe drinking water, use of improved sanitation and hand
washing with soap. Diarrhoea should be treated with oral rehydration salts (ORS) or a recommended
homemade fluid – a solution of clean water, sugar and salt.
DHS 2019/2020 recently released looked at trends of last 5 years immediately preceding the survey,
the infant mortality rate was 33 deaths per 1,000 live births. The child mortality rate was 13 deaths per
1,000 children surviving to age 12 months, while the overall under-5 mortality rate was 45 deaths
per 1,000 live births. Seventy-three percent of all deaths among children under age 5 in Rwanda take
place before a child’s first birthday, with 42% occurring during the first month of life. However, child
mortality accounts for 29% of all under-5 deaths.
An ECD baseline study conducted by UNICEF in 2014 among young children in poor rural areas
highlighted significant developmental gaps in terms of problem-solving, communication and personal-
social skills, as well as gross-motor and fine-motor development. While the country is awaiting the DHS
2019-20 results on Early Childhood Development (ECD) and other indicators to be released, the
previous survey showed that close to one third of children 36 to 59 months are developmentally not on
track in literacy-numeracy, physical, social-emotional and learning domains.
In order to address the above challenges, UNICEF has supported the Government of Rwanda to model
and scale up integrated approaches to delivery of programmes addressing the needs and rights of
young children in Rwanda. This includes the Developing Human Capital in Rwanda - Harnessing the
Power of Integrated Programming for Nutrition and ECD Programme, for which UNICEF received funds
from the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The five-year programme aims to improve
selected nutrition and development outcomes of children 0-6 years of age with a focus on 14 districts
in Rwanda109 through implementation of integrated nutrition-specific, nutrition-sensitive, ECD,
Education, WASH and Social Protection interventions (see Annex 1 – results framework for more details
on interventions). The programme contributes to the objectives of the National Child Development
Agency (NCDA) of scaling up provision of integrated child development services and reducing stunting.
The programme has a strong equity focus by promoting inclusion of the poorest households and
addressing gender equity gaps where applicable.
A DHCR Programme baseline study was conducted in the start of the programme and this will now be
complemented by an endline evaluation. The endline evaluation will assess the progress made in terms
of impacting human capital development, changes achieved from the baseline, and documenting best
practices and lessons learnt to inform future programming. The endline evaluation report will be used
to inform national programming and implementation of respective thematic policies for children.
OVERVIEW OF THE INITIATIVE TO BE EVALUATED
The overall goal of the proposed multi-sectoral programme has been to establish optimal conditions for
children to achieve their full potential and build a strong foundation to develop into adolescents with key
problem-solving and socio-emotional competencies, in order to increase human capital development in
Rwanda. The DHCR programme interventions have focused on young children, from pregnancy to six
years of age, including their parents and families, thereby ensuring a continuum of care that enhances
and sustains optimal child growth and development. To achieve the expected impact of developing
human capacity, the programme invested the budget of $25 million.
The Developing Human Capital in Rwanda programme (DHCR) was designed to respond to complex
and cross-sectoral issues affecting children’s holistic development. Thus, a multi-sectoral approach was
needed to address both immediate and underlying causes affecting the attainment of optimal child
growth and development. Evidence has shown that integrated multi-sectoral services have synergistic
effects and contribute to the greatest reductions in stunting and improvements in child development. As

such, the focus of the programme has been on the provision of an integrated package of services. The
programme deploys a number of strategies to enhance delivery of integrated services and to induce
required behaviour change, including systems strengthening through capacity building, behavior-
change communication and coordination for integrated services at central, decentralized and
community levels.
Overall goal of the programme: Increased human capital development in Rwanda with two
programmatic impact: 1) Prevalence of stunting among children under 5 years reduced and 2) Young
children’s holistic development improved. The programme has two impact indicators: 1) Prevalence of
stunting among children under 5 in targeted districts and 2) % of children developmentally on track in
targeted sectors/districts. The detailed theory of change (ToC) of the programme is available under
annexes (Annex 3).
The programme has been geared towards influencing national child-friendly policies and DHCR
Programme priorities fully aligned with the Government of Rwanda’s development policies and
programmes, such as VISION 2020 and the National Strategy for Transformation (NST), and specific
policies such as early childhood development policy, nutrition policy, social policy, and sectoral
development programmes.
Gender and equity considerations have been integral part of the programme informed by gender
assessments including Markets and Gender Survey (2016). Programme interventions took into account
identified issues around gender, youth, equity and disability have been built into the programme across
all programme interventions areas including social protection, health, nutrition, ECD, WASH, CP and
Education.
The main partners for the programme are both government institutions and civil society organizations,
United National agencies (WFP, WHO, FAO) which include the following:
1. Partners for Early Childhood Development (ECD) haven been the National Child Development
Agency (NCDA), AVSI, Imbuto Foundation, Anglican Church of Rwanda, ADEPE, Rwanda
Interfaith Council on Health (RICH)
2. Partners for nutrition include MIGEPROF, NCDA, RBC, MINAGRI, World Relief, Civil Society
Alliance for Nutrition (SUN), Fourteen districts, Rwanda Women Parliamentary Forum, Rwanda
Management Institute (RMI)
3. Education partnered with the International Education Exchange (IEE)
4. Partners for Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) are four districts, World Vision, Society of
Family Health (SFH)
5. Partners for Social Policy and Research (SPR) include Local Administrative entities Development
Agency (LODA), World Relief
Intended impact and outcomes of the Programme:
At impact level, the programme intends to contribute to:
● Reduction in the prevalence of stunting among children younger than five years of age in
targeted Districts.
● Improvements in young children's holistic development.
At outcome level, the programme broadly intends to:
● Strengthen delivery of integrated services across programme components at community level;
● Strengthen existing government systems in place to delivery sector-specific specific and
integrated services;
● Strengthen coordination and targeting of services to cover the most vulnerable populations;
and
● Improve the knowledge base to address programming gaps, facilitate scaling up and inform
policy development. (Social Policy)
Programme components:
The programme includes the following broad components:
1. Nutrition-specific interventions implemented nationally (i.e. across all 30 districts of the country)
mainly through the health sector and nutrition-sensitive interventions implemented in the 14
target districts through integrating nutrition into other social sectors, including agriculture and
social protection;
2. Provision of comprehensive ECD services and education at District and community levels;
Endline Evaluation of the Developing Human Capital in Rwanda (DHCR) Programme 52
3. Provision of WASH services and education to targeted communities, schools and ECD centres;
4. Support to the provision of child-sensitive social protection (expanded public works) and
sensitization targeting extremely poor households in selected communities (Sectors);
5. Provision of equitable pre-primary education in selected communities; and
6. Strengthening planning, management, coordination and monitoring, as well as cross-cutting
behaviour change component in support of the integrated programme.
Each programme component encompasses a complex set of measures and activities (Annex I) aimed
at supporting service delivery at community level while strengthening government systems and services
to promote universal access and replication.
Programme target groups and coverage:
The programme targets young children aged 0-6 years (‘the first critical years of life’) and their parents,
families and communities in order to achieve stunting reduction and improved child development
outcomes. In addition, the programme targets existing service providers in order to strengthen their
capacities for component-specific and integrated service delivery.
It is expected that this comprehensive approach will directly benefit at least 500,000 children and
families in Rwanda. Indirectly, the majority of Rwanda’s population will benefit from the positive change
in policy measures, service delivery and social norms, as well as by further potential replication of the
interventions by the government (during and beyond the funding period).
The programme has been implemented over a period of 5 years, from 2016 to 2021, with a focus on 14
Districts (out of 30). The districts were selected based on a number of criteria, including stunting
prevalence, poverty levels, the identified needs for programme delivery, and the potential to build on
the results already achieved through ongoing UNICEF programmes.
Whereas the programme aimed at promoting access to services at district level the focus on integrated
interventions was done in selected Sectors in each District. The Sectors were selected in liaison with
the respective district government offices and were prioritized based on a possibility to overlap existing
government programmes and UNICEF programme interventions. It is expected that the focus of this
evaluation will cover the same sectors in the programme intervention areas in order to assess the
potential impact of the integrated package of interventions on child nutrition and development.
Purpose
● The purpose of the proposed consultancy is to conduct an in-depth independent evaluation on the
five-year multi-sector DHCR Programme in 14 districts of Rwanda with a focus on sectors, where
UNICEF supported the GoR to provide an integrated package of nutrition and ECD services to
children and their families in order to reduce child stunting and promote child development.
● The consultant will aim to ensure that evaluations are implemented according to the quality
standards of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development
Assistance Committee (DAC), and that feedback from data on children, parents/caregivers, and
stakeholders are given primary consideration. The consultant will ensure that the results are
disseminated in an effective manner to improve future programme performance and contribute to
the on-going national programmes on fighting stunting and promoting child development.
● The purpose of the evaluation is to better understand how and under what conditions the
interventions and the activities implemented under the DHCR Programme are functioning and to
assess the extent to which the initiative has met its objectives and achieved expected results. The
results from this evaluation will inform decisions by the GoR to scale up and continue
implementation of similar approaches including adjustments needed. This information will also be
useful for UNICEF as well as development partners in determining continued relevance of the
programme and provide information on replicability in other districts.
Objectives
The main purpose of this summative evaluation is to assess the achievements and results of the DHCR
for nutrition and ECD programme in Rwanda.
More specifically the evaluation objectives are to:

SCOPE OF THE EVALUATION
Programmatic Scope
This evaluation will cover the DHCR Programme implementation period from 2016 to 2021. As the
interventions have been conducted in 14 targeted districts in Rwanda, the geographical coverage of
this evaluation will focus on same districts and sectors which were covered during the baseline to be
able to assess the impact of the programme.
The integrated nutrition and ECD package focused on children 0-6 years of age, boys and girls in areas
most affected by high stunting levels, while the nutrition and ECD package addressed the key needs of
vulnerable children, boys and girls in under-served areas. As such, the evaluation will put specific focus
on gender, equity and child rights dimensions of DHCR Programme.
While nutrition and ECD and related cross sectoral areas aimed at addressing stunting and child
development, this evaluation will assess these components in more detail. This will include a review of
the appropriateness of the UNICEF DHCR programme design in these sectors, including the delivery
modalities for target population groups and innovative approaches promoting integrated service delivery
piloted at community level. It will include a review of implementation by analysing coverage, results,
effectiveness, quality, and efficiency. It will also include a review of the quality and use of evidence,
assessing how well the response has used previous evidence such as reviews and EKN Phase I
Endline Evaluation of the Developing Human Capital in Rwanda (DHCR) Programme 54
evaluation to inform or adapt current programming, and what systems are in place to monitor the
situation and UNICEF’s performance. The analysis will take into consideration the generation / use of
information as well as gender and equity issues. The evaluation will investigate stakeholder
collaboration for nutrition governance and promotion of ECD as well as coordination of all actors to
achieve required synergy for proper programme implementation.
Geographic scope
The geographic scope will be limited to 14 districts which has been targeted for DHCR programme. It
is recognized that considerations of sampling which might orient areas to visit for evaluation purposes,
as well as COVID-19 restrictions which might pause some challenges. Despite these challenges, the
scope of the evaluation will still cover all the 14 districts. It is important to note that there might be spill
over effect of the programme which came as a result of the programme interventions at national
level.
EVALUATION QUESTIONS
It is expected that the evaluation be articulated under the five main OECD/DAC evaluation criteria
(Relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, coherence, impact and sustainability) as well as coordination
considering that DHCR Programme covered nutrition and ECD services and integrated development
interventions in targeted districts. The different criteria must be made explicit in the technical proposal
and the inception report.

Methodology
The proposed methodology for this evaluation is quasi-experimental design and will be complemented
by comparing baseline situation before and after interventions and evaluators will consider mixed
methods by including quantitative and qualitative during the process of evaluating the impact of this
programme. The evaluation should also embed human rights-based approach, gender equality and
equity lenses in its data collection and analysis, and reflect these findings in the draft and final report.
Data collection (observing COVID-19 protocols)
The data collection will engage a broad range of stakeholders at country level to ensure comprehensive
data as well as buy-in from all stakeholders in terms of the findings and recommendations of the
evaluation. Relevant government line ministries and institutions will be involved from the very beginning
in the development of TOR, Inception Report, and Final Report. The National Child Development
Agency (NCDA) will be work closely with UNICEF on this evaluation. Other stakeholders will participate
in the Evaluation Reference Group (ERG) and proper clearances will be sought from government
institutions such as the National Ethics Committee (RNEC) and the National Institute of Statistics of
Rwanda (NISR). The evaluation will intentionally involve different government ministries including the
Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Rwanda Biomedical Center (RBC), Ministry of Agriculture (MINAGRI),
Ministry of Local Government (MINALOC), Ministry of Family and Gender Promotion (MIGEPROF).
Key sources of information will include:
● Document review: Documents will be reviewed at the inception stage to frame the evaluation.
Documents to be reviewed will include documentation related to the programme, national
policies and strategies, assessments and studies related to the programme.
● Analysis of secondary data: Secondary data will mainly include available administrative data
and other monitoring data to determine if the initiative has reached its objectives quantitively.
The evaluation team should assess the quality and availability of data during the inception
phase.
● Collection of primary data: Data on key impact, outcome and output indicators will be
collected in order to allow for comparison with the baseline evaluation to assess progress and,
ultimately, impact.
● Focus group interviews with:
o Caregivers/parents
o Community workers/volunteers
o Districts staff (DPEM)
Endline Evaluation of the Developing Human Capital in Rwanda (DHCR) Programme 57
o Government staff (Ministries and NCDA)
● Key informant interviews with:
o Government staff (at central level and district level)
o UNICEF staff
o NGO staff/ Development Partners working in nutrition and ECD
● Site visits to selected sites
o Observation and onsite verification
Evaluation instruments
To conduct a comparative study, the DHCR evaluation will use the same data collection assessment
tool which were used during the baseline study subject to a few adjustments depending on changes in
the programme context. This tool is based on internationally recognized measures covering household
characteristics, child development, nutrition, health, caregiving practices, and access to services. See
table below for details on the study measures.

include an overview of the different data collection tools, including interview guides and focus group
guides, that will be used to answer each of the evaluation questions. Considering the number of
geographic locations, the inception report should take the same geographical locations as per the
baseline survey for data collection for the purposes of comparing the situation before and after
intervention and determine the progress made.
Data collected should consider gender aspects as well as age aspects by disaggregating data when
relevant. Ethical considerations must be considered in line with UNICEF guidelines.

Appendix 2: Intervention Context around ECD and Stunting
Country Context - Rwanda
Rwanda is a country with a population of 12.9 million people (2020),110 with 49.1% male compared to
50.8% female population.111 Located in Central/Eastern Africa, Rwanda shares borders with Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Tanzania and Burundi. The surface area of the country is 26,340 sq.
km112 divided into (5) five provinces. The provinces include Northern, Southern, Eastern, Western and
municipality of Kigali. The official languages are Kinyarwanda (spoken by majority Rwandans), English,
French and Swahili. A strong focus on homegrown policies and initiatives contributed to significant
improvement in access to services and human development indicators. Growth averaged 7.2% over
the decade to 2019.113 Measured by the national poverty line, poverty declined from 77% in 2001 to
38.2% in 2016, while life expectancy at birth improved from 33.4 years in the 1990s to 69 in 2019.114
In terms of COVID impact, the lockdown and social distancing measures, critical to control the COVID-
19 pandemic, sharply curtailed economic activities in 2020, resulting in the country’s gross domestic
product (GDP) to have dropped by 0.2% in 2020, compared to a projected expansion of 8% before the
COVID-19 outbreak.115 The combination of poor nutrition, limited health services, learning losses from
school closures, and the likelihood that some children (particularly adolescent girls and children from
poor households) may never return to school because of the COVID-19 have the potential to threaten
decades of progress in human capital development. The administrative map of Rwanda is illustrated in
Figure 2.116
Intervention - Early Childhood Development and Stunting
The description below gives an overview of the global and regional context of early childhood
development (including stunting), then dwells on the specifics of the sector within Rwanda.
Early Childhood Development and Stunting: Early
Figure: Domains of Nurturing Care
Childhood Development (ECD) is defined as the process by
which a young child acquires essential physical, motor,
cognitive, social, emotional and language skills.117 In lieu of
the importance of ECD, UNICEF developed “Nurturing Care”,
a framework for helping children survive and thrive to
transform health and human potential (as indicated in
Figure).118 Children who do not receive adequate health,
nutrition, early stimulation, learning opportunities, care and
protection, tend to have lowered cognitive, language and
psychosocial outcomes as well as executive functioning,
which translates to lowered academic achievement. Poor
school performance leads to inadequate preparation for
economic opportunities and, eventually, the perpetuation of
intergenerational poverty cycles.119 Stunting (height to age
measurement) is an indicator of chronic undernutrition and is
caused by inadequate intake of nutritious food, frequent illnesses such as diarrhoea and intestinal
worms, poor care practices, and lack of access to health and other essential services, especially in the
first 1,000 days of a child’s life but with potential effects lasting a lifetime.120
ECD is part of the transformative agenda for 2030, making it an international priority for the 21st century.
Global targets in education, health, nutrition (includes reduction in stunting) and protection (as
indicated in Figure 4) address key outcomes to realise young children’s developmental potential. ECD
also adds value to different strategic frameworks and partnerships, working towards the SDG goals,

such as Every Woman Every Child (EWEC),121 Global Partnership for Education (GPE),122 Scaling Up
Nutrition (SUN),123 and the Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children (GPEVAC).124 These
inclusions present both opportunities and challenges in policy setting, planning, budgeting,
programming and monitoring results for young children.
Global & Regional Context: Today, there are millions of young children not reaching their full potential
because of limited support available during early development. For instance, in low- and middle-income
countries across the world, 250 million children under the age of five are at risk of not reaching their
developmental potential because of poverty and stunting (or low height for age).125 Nearly two out of
five (20% of total) stunted children are living in South Asia, whilst another two live in sub-Saharan Africa
(in 2019). 126 The underlying reasons are similar across regions and include factors such as: poor
maternal health and nutrition, inadequate infant and young child feeding practices, and infections.127 In
2012, a resolution was passed by the World Health Assembly to endorse a 'Comprehensive
Implementation Plan on Maternal, Infant, and Young Child Nutrition’. The plan outlines a set of six global
nutrition targets to be achieved by 2025 – including reduction in stunting.128

of majority governments. By August 2020,
slightly over half of the 21 ESA countries had
developed a national ECD policy or strategic
framework.129 For some countries, ECD is
an integral part of sectoral policies and
strategic frameworks especially on health
and education. Despite this progress, there
are evident gaps in implementation of these
policies and frameworks including lack of i)
detailed financing strategies, ii) multisectoral
coordination mechanisms and iii)
accountability relationships for services
delivered and resources.130 Nearly three
quarters of children between 0-6 years are
not accessing early childhood education on
average. As of 2019, average attendance
rate in early childhood education131 is estimated at only 24%.
121 EWEC movement aims to intensify national and international commitment and action by governments, the UN, multilaterals, private sector and civil society

122 GPE supports lower-income countries to improve equitable access, quality and learning outcomes in the early years by providing technical and financial
support.
123 SUN is a movement led by countries committed to the understanding that good nutrition is the best investment of the future. The political leaders of SUN

The statistics on stunting in ESA region (a proxy for the incidence of developmental delays) have
increased in countries of Sub-Saharan Africa despite plummeting globally (refer to Box#2 for more
statistics).132 There are considerable challenges such as lack of funding, proper budget allocation, lack
of technical expertise and robust monitoring system from government. Some countries in the region
have made progress in reducing the prevalence of stunting, and the average prevalence in ESAR has
declined from 46% in 2000 to 32% in 2020.133 However, the average annual rate of reduction in stunting
is lower than the average population growth rates. The net effect is that the number of stunted children
is increasing within the region.
ECD and stunting in Rwanda: In the past decade, Rwanda has made decent progress in achieving
child-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), including reductions of maternal and infant
mortality, universal access to primary education and poverty reduction. Despite improvement in
development and economic growth, Rwanda continues to face some significant challenges, particularly
pertaining to the first critical years of children’s lives. Additionally, poverty is still widespread as per the
2017’s Integrated Household Living Conditions Survey (EICV5), 38.2% of the population live below the
national poverty line and 16% below the extreme poverty line. The high prevalence of stunting and the
proportion of children not reaching their full developmental potential is due to the combined effects of
inadequate dietary intake (as only one in six children enjoys all recommended feeding practices),134
insufficient nutrition intake of pregnant and lactating women135, repeated infection, inadequate
psychosocial stimulation (only about half of the parents surveyed engaged in activities that stimulate
a child’s development and early learning), and a lack of opportunities for optimal child development
(RDHS 2019 - 2020).
Vulnerability & Exposure: Threats to early childhood development and proper nutrition are greatest
among children living in the poorest households, where children are less likely to receive support for
early learning at home and more likely to be exposed to multiple risk factors due to poor standards of
housing (refer to Box 3 for relevant statistics).136 Another reason for prevalence of stunting remains
largely dependent on the educational and wealth status of the primary caregivers.137 As per the RDHS
2019-20, the proportions of children who are stunted and underweight declined substantially with
increasing mother’s educational level. For instance, the prevalence of stunting among children whose
mothers have no education is 45% compared with 6% among those whose mothers have more than a
secondary education. Stunting and underweight are inversely related to household wealth.138
Policy Framework Around ECD and Stunting: As a signatory to the global and regional frameworks
such as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Children (UNCRC),139 Education for All
(EFA),140 SDGs (2, 3, 4 and 16 – as explained above) and standards on the rights of the child, Rwanda
is committed to using ECD as a platform for ensuring the fulfilment of the rights of children. In this
regard, the country has put in place several policies and strategies to tackle challenges related to early
childhood development (including stunting). For instance, the National ECD Policy141 that set the
conditions to develop community led integrated ECD programmes and through strengthening and
coordinating essential inter-sectoral and sectoral services for children and parents. The National ECD
Program Strategic Plan (NECDP SP 2018-2024) calls for the development of an integrated approach
that addresses cross-cutting issues of childcare, education, growth and development, safety, health
and nutrition, and food security. The National Early Childhood Development Programme (2017)
oversees all nutrition promotion and ECD activities within the country, and sets standards, curricula and
implementation approaches to provide national guidance to programme implementers.

141 The policy aims to ensure all Rwandan children achieve their potential, are healthy, well-nourished and safe, and their mothers, fathers and communities
become nurturing caregivers through receiving integrated early childhood development services.

Appendix 8: Rationale Behind the Departure from the Proposed Design
It is important to note that initially Quasi-Experimental Design was proposed for this Endline study but
after desk review and discussion with UNICEF, few issues were highlighted regarding data
contamination including:
1. DHCR activities were rolled out in 2017 which was before the baseline was conducted (in 2018).
In this case, using baseline data for comparison between treatment and control districts will
confound the impact.
2. The DHCR Baseline was conducted in only 7 out of 14 programme districts for nutrition specific
intervention. There are other organizations which are working in remaining 16 districts of
Rwanda for nutrition specific intervention. The level of support and coverage of the Core
Nutrition Activities (CNAs) also varies among different districts both in number of partners
supporting the district, the number of CNAs implemented, and the coverage of beneficiaries for
these CNAs.166 This poses a problem of data contamination in sampling and spill-over.
3. The target audience for reducing stunting is children between 6 – 23 months as preventive
measures are most effective when targeted at this age bracket. For a quasi-experimental
design, children below age 5 from Program districts and control districts could have been
chosen using probabilistic matching based on the certain matching variables; however, it
sounds doable theoretically but may pose problems in practicality later on. Also, the selected
sample is not representative at the district level as DHS is nationally representative. District
representative sample from the DHS is not possible.
4. Most importantly, this is a summative evaluation, not an impact assessment. Both contribution
and comparative analysis are enough for the said purpose.

Appendix 11: Household Survey Details (sample, coverage, HH selection)
For the quantitative section, the Evaluators have used before-after analysis. The HHS was undertaken
for a pre-determined sample of 1353 HHs in 7 treatment districts. This approach is adopted from the
Programme baseline and helped understand the change in indicators mentioned below:
● Impact 1: Prevalence of stunting among children under five years reduced.
● Outcome 1: Children under 5 utilize effective nutrition / health interventions.
● Outcome 2: Young children and families utilise quality ECD services, and parents/primary
caregivers apply improved childcare and stimulation practices.
● Outcome 3: Families with young children in the targeted districts use improved water,
sanitation and hygiene services.
● Outcome 4: Poorest households with children under 5 in 10 districts/sectors have benefitted
from child-sensitive public works.
For the baseline, a comprehensive assessment tool was designed to measure several internationally
recognised areas covering household characteristics, child development, nutrition, health, caregiving
practices, and access to services. As the endline was implemented in a COVID environment, the
Evaluators have refined the baseline tool to focus on those indicators that directly feed into the
Programme’s log-frame (refer to Appendix 10 for HH endline tool). Therefore, the Household Survey
tool included the following:
Table: Domains in Household Questionnaire
Sr. # Domain Specific components
1 Child and Caregiver Information Sex only, Sex, Relationship to the child, Age, Literacy, Marital status,

Target Group (Population)
The study population of the survey are the households that were selected for the Programme baseline
in seven districts (out of 14 intervention districts) where the baseline assessment. Districts include
Endline Evaluation of the Developing Human Capital in Rwanda (DHCR) Programme 85
Burera, Gatsibo, Gicumbi, Karongi, Ngororero, Nyaruguru and Rutsiro. The baseline study targeted
these areas for the high level of poverty and presence of social protection programmes, including
expanded and classic public works. In each district, one sector was selected as the study site.167
Survey Respondents
In line with the baseline study, the target respondents for the survey were caregivers of children ages
6–23 months and their children. For the endline Evaluation, the Evaluators also enrolled siblings of the
original respondents aged 6–23 months at the time of data collection. This design optimised
opportunities to follow intervention impact in children enrolled at baseline as well as assess whether
children ages 6–23 months in the same households are doing better overall compared with before
intervention implementation.
Sample Size
Household having 6-23 months old child selection was made using two stage sampling method. At
stage one 53 Primary Sampling Units (Villages/Localities were selected at random from seven districts.
At stage 2, all households in PSU were listed as household having 6-23 months old child (target
household) and non-target household.
Total of 1,352 eligible households were identified in sampling frame during household listing, therefore
meeting was held with client & stakeholder to give updated status of household listing and decision on
sample size adjustment because population of targeted households are only 1352 and 411 were
interviewed during baseline survey. It was decided all identified targeted households will be selected as
sample for the survey. The Cochran’s sample size formula generates 1362 sample with the assumption
that about 9.4 per cent of all the households had children between 6–23 months, as well as two-sided
alpha significance level of 0.05, plus a margin of error of ±1.55 per cent. Finite Population Correction
(FPC ) factor minimize the sample upto 678 for finite population 1352 households. The number of
households surveyed from seven districts decreases the standard error of estimate 4% to just 1.55%.
For your information Excel sheet is attached
Sampling Strategy
For the endline Evaluation, the Evaluators applied the same distribution of sample across seven districts
as it was implemented in the baseline study. The sample allocation per district is indicated below:

Household & Respondent Selection Method
A total of 1,637 households participated in the Programme Baseline conducted, and this Endline study
collected data from the same households. The survey respondent is caregivers of children ages 6–23
months and their children. UNICEF has provided lists of homes that participated in the baseline, which
were used to identify the households that still have eligible children (6-23 months old). Considering that
the children that were 6-23 months old at baseline are no longer eligible to participate in the final
Evaluation, it is also possible that some of the caregivers may have given birth to children falling in the
age bracket and therefore qualify to be part of the final Evaluation.
Anthropometric measurements
The anthropometric measurement associated with stunting (height for age), wasting (weight for height)
and underweighting (weight for age) were done using scales and height boards supplied by UNICEF to
health facilities. The local partner, Research Hub, has a training manual for Anthropometric
measurement (attached on the next page) which were adapted for children between 0 – 23 months (the
age group that was targeted in DHCR baseline). Under this, each household and child were assessed
on: Weight of Caregiver and child, Child’s length (for children under two years) in cm and Child’s height
(for children aged two or more years). In lieu of COVID, only enumerators who are vaccinated were
hired to carry out this exercise, and the team were tested for Covid-19 before the training. During the
fieldwork, it was ensured that the equipment was sanitised after each use.
Anthropometric Measurement Training Manual
Setting up the equipment
▪ Ensure that all equipment is clean, working, and correctly adjusted so that it measures
accurately.
▪ Standing scales and measuring boards should be placed on a hard, flat, and level surface
during measurement.
▪ Hanging scales should be securely hung with adequate room for taking measurements.
▪ Measurements may be taken outdoors, weather permitting. If measuring outdoors is
uncomfortable due to heat, rain, or interference from other people, move indoors or to a
secluded place to conduct measurements
▪ Using a respectful, kind, and gentle tone, explain the reason for taking the measurement and
the procedures involved and ask if the parent/caregiver has any questions
Consent Before beginning any measurement,
Endline Evaluation of the Developing Human Capital in Rwanda (DHCR) Programme 87
▪ Consent/assent must have been obtained from the caregiver/parent. If caregiver/parent refuses
to participate, respect this decision and do not take any measurement.
▪ Always thank the parent/caregiver.
▪ Stop/do not measure if:
o The parent/caregiver being measured refuses.
o The person being measured is distressed or too sick
Measurer Preparation
▪ The measurer should have clean hands before holding or positioning the child being measured.
▪ The measurer should remove any objects from her/his hands and wrists, such as big watches
or bracelets, so as not to interfere with the measurement
Individuals with Special Needs
▪ In the event of the child having conditions that affect their ability to stand; straighten their arms,
legs or back; or hold themselves steady, adapt measurement protocols or provide additional
assistance to the individual being measured.
▪ Interpretation of measurements may also be more challenging.
▪ When conducting anthropometry for a survey, measurers should measure the individual and
note his/her impairment or condition on the survey form.
Things to keep in mind
▪ Follow the protocols: Following each step of every procedure every time measurements are
taken improves quality.
▪ Though some procedures may seem simple and repetitive, never take them for granted or omit
any step.
▪ Keep hands free of sharp objects: For safety, hold pencils or pens only while recording
measurements, not while positioning or holding the person being measured.
▪ Measure one person at a time: If you are measuring more than one person, it is important to
complete and record all measurements for one person before beginning to measure another
person. This will help prevent errors in recording measurements and respects the time of the
person being measured.
▪ Always supervise the person being measured; do not leave him/her unattended to on or near
anthropometric equipment: This prevents the person from being injured (e.g., tripping on, falling
off or cutting him/herself with equipment).
▪ Carefully record measurements
▪ Measurements should be recorded in the appropriate spaces as marked on the health card,
questionnaire, or other relevant document.
▪ When recording an individual’s age, it is best to record the exact age, if possible. However,
while it is important to know and record the date of birth, the date of measurement, and the
exact age of an individual (especially for children),
▪ Record measurements clearly and accurately to the precision required for each measure.
Record weight to the nearest two decimal points.
▪ If using a pen, cross out the error completely and write the correct measurement.
▪ Repeated measurements if needed.
▪ Involve the parent/caregiver: Being weighed and/or measured can be an uncomfortable or
frightening experience for a child. The parent/caregiver can assist in positioning, carrying,
and/or calming the child being measured, helping the child to feel secure and remain still. This
will help achieve an accurate measurement and reduce the child’s stress
Measuring height of children below 59 months
▪ Show the measuring board to the parent/caregiver and explain that the board will be used to
measure the child’s
length/height.
▪ Inform the parent/caregiver
that her / his help may be
needed.
▪ Ask the parent/caregiver to
remove the child’s shoes and
anything on her/his head or
hair, such as a hat or hair
ornament, that may interfere
with the length/height
measurement.
Endline Evaluation of the Developing Human Capital in Rwanda (DHCR) Programme 88
▪ Make sure the surface of the measuring board is clean before placing the child on it.
▪ Measure children while they are lying down. This measurement is known as “length” or
“recumbent length.”
▪ Place the measuring board on a hard, flat surface.
▪ Place the footboard firmly against the heels of both of the child’s feet.
▪ Ensure that the child’s legs are straight at the knees and that the knees are positioned correctly.
▪ Check the child’s position to ensure that she/he is lying straight just before taking length
measurement.
▪ Read, record, and plot measurements carefully
Measuring Height in Children 59months old
▪ Place the measuring board on a hard, flat (level) surface vertically against a wall, table, tree,
etc. Make sure the board is stable.
▪ Ask the parent/caregiver to place the child on the board and kneel in front of the child. The
measurer should kneel on the left side of the child, with the trained
assistant kneeling on the child’s right (or the parent/caregiver moving
to that position)
▪ Determine whether the child’s heel should be against or away from
the back of the measuring board by drawing an imaginary line from
the tip of the shoulder to the heel (called the “mid-axillary line”). This
line should be perpendicular (90°) to the base of the measuring board
where the person is standing.
▪ Lift the child’s chin so his/her eyes look straight ahead. Make sure the
person’s line of sight (i.e., the Frankfort plane) is parallel to the ground
and perpendicular (i.e., 90°) to the back of the measuring board. For
a child, squat in front of him/her at eye level and gently hold the child’s
head in position.
▪ With the help of the parent/caregiver, ensure that:
▪ The person’s arms hang down at his/her sides and the shoulders are
level.
▪ The person’s weight is distributed evenly on both feet.
▪ The person’s buttocks touch the back of the board. In addition: For most preschool-age children
who are underweight or normal weight, the back of the head, shoulder blades, calves, and
heels will touch the back of the measuring board.
▪ For heavy or obese children, the shoulder blades and back of the calves will probably not touch
the back of the measuring board, and the back of the head and heels also might not touch it.
▪ Check the person’s position and readjust as necessary. For children who have difficulty
standing fully straight, gently pushing the stomach can help them stand straight.
▪ Ask the caregiver to gently and firmly slide the measuring board’s movable headpiece down
until it touches the crown of the person’s head (compresses the hair).
▪ Read aloud the height indicated by the headpiece to the nearest 0.1 cm.
▪ Record and/or plot the height clearly and accurately on the health card, questionnaire, or other
relevant document.
▪ Remove the headpiece from the person’s head, and gently help him/her to get off the board.
Return a child to the parent/caregiver.
▪ Check the recorded or plotted height for accuracy and legibility.
Standing Scale with Taring Feature
Procedure:
▪ Zero the scale. The method used to zero the scale depends
on the type of scale being used.
▪ Some scales can be zeroed by covering the solar panel for
1 second. When the readout says 0.0 and an image of a
mother and baby is displayed, the scale is ready to be used.
Other scales require that someone step on the scale.
▪ Ask the parent/caregiver to step onto the center of the scale
and stand still. Wait until the weight of the parent/caregiver
displays and remains fixed in the display panel. If no
parent/caregiver is available,
▪ Tare the scale while the parent/caregiver is on it.
Endline Evaluation of the Developing Human Capital in Rwanda (DHCR) Programme 89
▪ Place the child in the parent/caregiver’s arms and ask the parent/ caregiver to remain still. The
parent/caregiver should try to calm the child and prevent him/her from moving.
▪ The child’s weight will appear in the display.
▪ Read the child’s weight aloud.
▪ Check the recorded or plotted weight for accuracy and legibility.
Edema measurement
▪ This is a condition characterized by the presence of fluids in the
body. Malnutrition is one of the many causes of the condition. To
ascertain the presence of edema;
▪ apply moderate thumb pressure on the back of the foot or ankle
for about 5 seconds
▪ repeat with other foot
▪ Edema is present if the impression of the thumb remains for some
time

Appendix 18: Quality Assurance Measures Implemented
General Quality Control During Fieldwork
The following key measures were implemented to ensure the quality assurance of all the
processes during field data collection; In addition to these measures, the evaluators implemented
various safety and protective protocols (See next section) to ensure that all research
participants/respondents and evaluators themselves are not exposed to any possible risk under
COVID-19 pandemic.
Continued support and supervision: The consultants (both international and national) with support from
the local partner provided support and supervision in the field whenever necessary.
Ethical clearance was obtained with the support of UNICEF RCO
Experienced staff was engaged for field data collection.
Comprehensive training of all the field staff was ensured. The core team trained the master trainers at
regional level, which in turn trained the other staff.
Gender balanced staff was deployed
Informed Consent from each respondent was taken by explaining the purpose of their activity and its
relevance to them.
Collection of Field Evidence of the events was done with prior approval from the concerned
respondents/participants of the KIIs and FGDs.
Confidentiality and anonymity of the participants was maintained, and findings were summarized to an
appropriate level of aggregation without revealing the identity of respondents.
Quality Assurance of Household Survey Processes
The quality assurance of the household survey was achieved through the following steps:
A senior National team staff member accompany randomly selected field teams during the initial days of data
collection to observe, double-check work, and provide on-site feedback to enumerators;
All questionnaires were tracked and accounted for by assigning identification numbers;
Interview log sheets (record completed questionnaires and rescheduled appointments) submitted by
enumerators daily and verified by supervisors;
Supervisors assess/check the completed questionnaires at the end of each day; and where required
supervisors have a coaching session with each enumerator to highlight any inconsistencies or inaccuracies
in the completed interviews
Any errors, lessons, and corrective measures discussed by each field team daily during evening meetings
and shared with other teams through supervisors;
All team members remained in contact to ensure a shared understanding of approaches, data collection
processes, challenges, and mitigation measures;
Data entry was done automatically with the use of CAPI devices for survey administration. The CAPI based
interview inherits several ‘in-built’ quality checks around ‘skip patterns’ in the questionnaire logic
Endline Evaluation of the Developing Human Capital in Rwanda (DHCR) 126
10% of the data entry was cross checked or verified/validated by contacting the ‘relevant households’ either
through making second field visits168 to them or through phone calls (who have provided their contact
numbers):
Independent (Survey) Quality Monitoring:
In addition to the quality control measures mentioned above, the Evaluators identified and
deployed a team of independent field monitors who carried out the following activities:
Spot-checking: The team performed a spot-checking exercise on 5% of the total sampled
respondents.
Field Protocols Monitoring: Through its local partner, the Evaluation Team observed all
Prot ocol
enumeration teams to check whether the asking of questions, recording of responses and
treatment of respondents is compliant with the standards.
F i
gu
re Accompanying Interview: The field monitors observed fieldwork protocols to ensure that
Pr3oto.col respondents are selected appropriately, and that the replacement procedure is carried out
6 : according to standards/guidelines. At least 10% of total interviews were observed and supervised

Appendix 20: COVID-19 Specific Safety and Protective Protocols
During Data Collection, the evaluators adopted some necessary precautionary measures to cope with
COVID-19 situation. These measures included:
a) Maintaining safe distance between each participant (KIIs, FGDs, workshop/consultative
sessions) by making seating arrangements accordingly. This would be done in advance
through local partner.
b) The evaluators (including the local partner and national experts) will provide the disposable
face masks to the participants to wear it before entering to place of FGDs.
c) Simple disposable gloves will be provided to the participants to ensure that each stationary
item (paper, pencil etc.) if used during interaction, remain out of contact of the participant.
d) The Evaluators will ensure that local partner provide hand-sanitizer to use by the participants
during interaction with evaluators.
e) All evaluation team members (international team and national staff) will always carry hand-
sanitizers before visiting any office to conduct KII or other formal/informal meetings during
field mission.
f) For simple/necessary refreshment during training and FGDs, disposable individual
consumables (glass, plates etc.) would be used.
g) Each participant would be dealt with respect, politeness and honour while ensuring above
arrangements.
h) The evaluators will be flexible to opt for any other evolving but considerably necessary
precautionary measure that may evolve during discussions with UNICEF team, Government
staff and local team to comply with and respect for national context due to COVID-19.

Appendix 21: Ethical Approval Process and Letter
The ethical approval application for DHCR was submitted to the Rwanda National Ethics Committee
(RNEC) on November 16th, 2021, by Mr. Valens. The application requested a special expedited
approval as the field work needed to be finished before Christmas and New year holidays. The RNEC
requested presentation on the DHCR Endline Evaluation study on November 29th, 2021. After
presentation, they requested to change contact details on consent form and requested transport or
monetary benefit for the FGD participants. These adjustments were made in the final application to
RNEC after which the approval was granted on December 14th.
Please note that the fee for ethical approval was submitted to RNEC on October 23rd, 2021, as per the
original plan of DHCR Evaluation. However, UNICEF requested change in methodology on October
23rd, 2021, which was not possible on such a short notice. The Inception Report was finally approved
by UNICEF on November 15th, 2021.

evaluators to produce analysis, conclusions and recommendations
that can be used confidently to improve organizational learning,
inform decision-making and create accountability.
A national consultative workshop was conducted with selected
stakeholders (national & sub-national) to enhance the utility and
application of the evaluation.
Norm 3: Credibility is based on independence, In addition to the steps that are being taken to ensure compliance
Credibility impartiality, and rigorous methodology with the norms of independence and impartiality, the evaluation is
being implemented following transparent processes (by making the

Moreover, by evolving and implementing ‘inclusive approaches’ as
evident in terms of constitution of multi-stakeholder ESC (for
oversight) and reaching out to all key stakeholders including service
providers, donors, technical partners, media, communities and
others. A series of robust and tested quality assurance mechanisms
(refer to the main report) are to be put in place for quality
implementation and data collection. The evaluators are committed
to ensure derivation of evaluation results (or findings) and
recommendations by applying the conscientious, explicit, and
judicious use of the best available, objective, reliable and valid data
and by accurate quantitative and qualitative analysis of evidence.
The credibility of the evaluation was achieved through careful use of
the available data. To maintain credibility final evaluation report was
published in UNICEF evaluation database.

WHO
Existing WHO guidelines related to neonatal care; infant and young child nutrition; environmental health; prevention
and treatment of childhood illnesses; violence and injury prevention; mental health; prevention of noncommunicable
diseases; and support for children with developmental difficulties or disabilities, refer to the importance of respective
interventions for ECD. However, they do not address ECD-specific interventions such as those related to
responsive caregiving and early learning.180
FAO
ECD is not in direct goals of FAO but for FAO holistic and coherent school programmes and policies are key to
achieve children’s human rights to food, education and health. Through complementary interventions such as
healthy school meals and food and nutrition education, pupils can improve their diets, develop healthier food
practices and extend these to their families and communities. These programmes can also support local
agriculture, strengthen and diversify local food systems and help move people out of poverty by sourcing food for
school meals from local smallholder farmers. FAO works with governments to leverage schools’ potential through
programmes and policies, supporting the Sustainable Development Goals of food security, nutrition, education and
health for everyone.181 DHCR lacks alignment with FAO on ECD as it could have helped in utilizing ECD centers
for imparting information on healthy school meals and food and nutrition etc.
WFP
In Rwanda, the school feeding on-site for children corresponds to Early Child Development (ECD) which hasn't
started since the beginning of the country strategic plan -CSP (2019)182. In 2015, Burundi refugee crisis began as
they try to escape violence in their home country, thousands of Burundians have fled and become refugees. These
people seek shelter in several different countries, including Rwanda.183 At the end of 2020, some 65,000 Burundian
refugees were registered in Rwanda. Between 27 August and 31 December 2020 weekly convoys were organized,
facilitating the return of 7,896 refugees.184 This affected approximately 35,286 refugee children and host community
children attending the same school as refugee children. This included a scale-up of the national school feeding
programme to reach all primary schools, from the programme’s current target reach of secondary schools and early
childhood development centers.185

*** Important Note: The above calculated number of beneficiaries are liable to “double counting”. For example, one child may
have received Vitamin A supplementation and MNP. Also, households benefitting from integrated child-sensitive social
protection with improved socio-economic indicators may also have screened and who have received one or more livelihood
enhancement inputs (livestock / agricultural inputs / loans). It is not possible to calculate unique value of beneficiaries.
