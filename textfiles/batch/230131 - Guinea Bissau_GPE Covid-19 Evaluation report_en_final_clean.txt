1. Executive Summary
1.1. Introduction
In Guinea-Bissau, COVID-19 has exacerbated a deep learning crisis, related to many challenges in the
education system, including a lack of inclusive and safe school infrastructures, qualified human
resources and didactic and pedagogical resources, as well as teachers' strikes. When the first cases of
COVID-19 were detected in Guinea-Bissau, all educational institutions (from pre-school to higher
education) closed, further compounding the above challenges, reducing the learning time of students,
and enhancing the risk of drop-out.
To respond to an emergency, UNICEF Guinea-Bissau received an emergency funding from the GPE for
a total amount of USD 3,5 million. Initially designed to run for 18 months (from July 2020 to December
2021), the implementation cycle of the interventions covered by this funding was extended twice by a
total of ten months, until the end of October 2022.
The main objective of the Guinea-Bissau COVID-19 Education Sector Response project was to support
the government of Guinea-Bissau and the Local Education Group (LEG) to reduce the impact of the
coronavirus on the education of children in the country by ensuring safe school operations and the
continuity of learning and well-being for children and youth, especially for the most vulnerable affected
by the outbreak.
This included the following specific objectives: i) To support response coordination and real-time
monitoring (focusing on the most vulnerable);ii) To ensure safe school operations including through
hygiene supplies and risk communication; iii) To support continuity of learning through access to
remote learning programs as appropriate for Guinea Bissau; iv) To scale-up psychosocial, health,
WASH, and nutrition services within the Education sector; v) To ensure a safe opening-back of schools
through back-to-school campaigns, catch-up classes, and accelerated learning and vi) To codify and
disseminate best practice and innovation.
1.2. Purpose of the Evaluation
The purpose of the evaluation is two-fold: accountability and learning. With regards to accountability,
this evaluation will provide both the donor (vertical accountability) and the expected beneficiaries
(horizontal accountability) with solid evidence regarding the extent to which the Guinea-Bissau COVID-
19 Education Sector Response attained its envisaged objectives. As far as learning is concerned, it is
expected that the findings will inform the design and execution of new initiatives within the new
Country Programme. MEN, UNICEF, LEG partners, and the GPE will use the evidence-based findings to
inform and improve the design, implementation, monitoring, and assessment of future development
and humanitarian programming in the education sector.
1.3. Objectives of the Evaluation
The objectives of the evaluation are as follows:
1. To determine the relevance, coherence, effectiveness, and efficiency of the Guinea-Bissau
COVID-19 Education Sector Response project.
2. To identify lessons learning regarding what worked and did not work during the
implementation of the project, including unexpected outcomes (positive and negative);
5
3. To critically analyse the theory of change and the extent to which its planned logical framework
and assumptions compare with the actual implementation and the results achieved;
4. To assess the extent to which the project integrated equity, human rights, and gender
principles into its design, implementation, and monitoring;
5. To formulate key recommendations regarding: (1) how to further strengthen the response to
the COVID-19 pandemic in Guinea-Bissau; (2) how to prepare for future education in
emergency (EiE) situations and make the education sector more resilient; and (3) how to better
implement future EiE interventions.
1.4. Scope of the Evaluation
Regarding the thematic scope, the evaluation all the intervention areas included in the Project. This
included not only all the activities directly related to schools and learning, but also to the cross-sectoral
interventions supported by the project (for example, cash transfers, nutrition, WASH, and child
protection). The geographic scope was national , so the evaluation included national level secondary
data, as well as information covering all regions of the country for the document review. The fieldwork
included data collection in Bissau, Oio and Bafatá, considering rural and urban regions.
Regarding the chronologic scope, the evaluation examined all the activities implemented from the
launch of the project in July 2020 until the time of data collection in November 2022.
1.5. Criteria and Evaluation Questions
In order to fulfil the aim and objectives stated above, this evaluation was guided by five OECD
evaluation criteria: (A) relevance; (B) coherence; (C) effectiveness; (D) efficiency; and (E) sustainability,
as well as (F) an additional Gender, Equity and Human Rights criterion. In order to clarify how well the
Project matched these criteria, a total of 20 questions were formulated, and an evaluation matrix
developed accordingly (see Appendix 6).
1.6. Methodology
Within the overall framework of the Core Commitments for Children in Humanitarian Action (CCC), a
mixed-methods approach was used to collect and analyze information for the evaluation, consisting of
a desk review, a review of learning and communication materials, secondary quantitative data analysis,
and primary qualitative data (semi-structured interviews, direct observation, and focus groups). In
total, 66 individuals (10 women, 31 men, 12 girls, and 13 boys) were interviewed in semi-structured
interviews or focus groups.
Regarding the sampling strategy evaluation opted for a purposeful sampling strategy based on the
selected intervention sites in Bissau, Oio and Bafatá.
After presenting and receiving feedback on the initial findings, the evaluation conducted a systematic
review and analysis of all data, identifying key themes, patterns, relationships, and explanations
relevant to the evaluation questions and indicators in the evaluation matrix. The analysis, which was
performed manually, compared the project objectives with the actual findings, using the evaluation
matrix as a framework to organize data and guide the analysis. The evaluation used different lines of
evidence and triangulation of sources.
6
Data collection and processing were carried out in compliance with the UNEG Ethical Guidelines for
Evaluation and its principles.
1.7. Presentation of the Main Findings and Conclusions
The Guinea-Bissau COVID-19 Education Sector Response project was a “hybrid” project, with both
emergency and development aspects. As such, the Project fits with current reforms inspired by the
World Humanitarian Summit, which focus on the ongoing quest to find “new ways of working” that
bridge humanitarian action, development, peace, and security in a “nexus” approach, amidst
protracted global displacement.
The evaluation arrived at the following conclusions regarding the relevance, coherence, effectiveness,
efficiency, sustainability, as well as gender, equity and human rights:
Relevance: The Project was well aligned with the Contingency Plan for the education sector, supporting
its main objectives and contributing to all four specific objectives of the Contingency Plan.
Furthermore, the Project’s Theory of Change (ToC) was indeed logical and mostly aligned with
implementation realities, as all the elements of the ToC were translated into planned project outputs,
the majority of which were also implemented. Using the COVID-19 emergency situation as an entry
point, the Project looked beyond the short-term impact of the pandemic to address systemic
challenges related to the resilience of the education sector through a multi-sectoral approach.
However, the Project’s resilience aspect (although it is discussed in the Project document narrative)
was not made explicit in the Project objectives However, a few aspects of the ToC were not fully aligned
with implementation realities, namely distance learning, recovery classes, and accelerated learning.
Given the multitude of supply- and demand-side factors hampering education in Guinea-Bissau, the
multi-sectoral approach taken by the Project was highly relevant to tackle these multi-dimensional
barriers.
Coherence: The Project’s objectives were fully aligned with government priorities and national
policies, in particular the national Education Sector Plan 2017-2025 and the Government’s National
Contingency Plan, as well as the UNICEF Country Programme Document 2016-2020 and the UNCT’s
Socio-economic Response Plan. The Project accelerated other reforms previously discussed by MEN
and partners, particularly in relation to the development of a national strategy for distance learning to
benefit out-of-school children and the implementation of catch-up programmes to minimize the loss
of learning.
Effectiveness: By extending emergency-related services to more than 1,500 schools, the Project made
an important contribution to ensuring safe schools operations and the continuity of learning. The main
objective and half of the specific objectives were nearly fully reached. Three specific objectives were
partially reached. In particular, accelerated learning was not fully implemented, while the effectiveness
of distance learning was doubtful, given the restricted access and lack of circular learning. Good
practice and innovation were addressed only through a brief mid-term evaluation and the present final
evaluation. Factors that promoted the effectiveness of the Project were the demonstration of MEN’s
commitment (with UNICEF support) to assist schools to remain open, the alignment with the
Contingency Plan, the multi-sectoral nature of interventions, and the use of the mWater database.
Factors that hindered the effectiveness of the Project were the late recruitment of a full-time project
manager, the low absorption and implementation capacity of MEN, leadership turnover in MEN, the
lack of water at school level, transportation problems, and the non-availability of previously planned
partnerships to conduct a learning assessment. Regarding unexpected outcomes, the Project
7
facilitated a trusted list of schools for MEN and its partners, fostered the accountability of governance
in the education sector, and promoted awareness of the importance of WASH in schools.
Efficiency: Considering the challenges to implementation (including low absorption capacity, frequent
leadership changes, and customs clearance problems, among others), the timeliness of the Project’s
implementation can be considered satisfactory. The largest shares of the budget went to Output 2
(Sanitization of schools) and Output 4 (Multi-sectoral services), which is justifiable, given the close
linkage between Output 2 and the overall objective of continuing education, and the complexity of a
multi-sectoral approach. Due to the high costs involved with water infrastructure, fixed handwashing
devices were only installed in 20 schools that already had access to water. This was efficient, even
though it may have exacerbated existing inequalities. Furthermore, the efficiency of the Project was
facilitated by the installation of the CTIP for coordination and monitoring, synergies with existing
initiatives within UNICEF, and the use of mWater as a low-cost tool for the collection, storage, and
analysis of cross-sectoral data.
Sustainability: The project built logistical capacity for operating in an emergency situation, as well as
overall capacity on education in emergencies, for example, through mWater which has alleviated
known weaknesses in national education data systems and provided key information on the sector to
guide and monitor action going forward. The main coordinating body established by the Project, the
CTIP, was recently been entrusted with the responsibility of coordinating the Governing Council of the
Ministry of Education and may function as the Education Sector Plan Coordination Committee in the
future. Moreover, the agenda in favour of SRGBV, distance learning, and accelerated learning has been
advanced as a result of the Project and have improved the capacity of the Education Sector to deal
with other types of disruptions to fragile education system, notably teacher strikes, at central level.
The sustainability of the Project was further enhanced by directly and indirectly engaging with the
Teacher Study Groups (Comissões de Estudos, COMES), the School Management Committees (Comité
de Gestão Escolar, COGES), and the parents’ associations (Associação de pais e encarregados de
educação de alunos, APEEA), all of which are regulated under MEN norms and standards. However,
doubts remain regarding local school administration’s capacity to deal with future emergencies.
Equity, gender, and human rights: The Project applied equity considerations in the selection of
geographical regions and in the targeting and implementation of the cash transfer initiative. The
priority geographical areas selected for the Project included (i) the regions and areas most affected by
the spread of COVID-19 and (ii) the regions with the highest number of children out of school.
Conversely, efficiency gains may have come at the expense of equity, with regards to the exclusion of
households of out-of-school children for the cash transfer, and the installation of fixed handwashing
devices in schools that already disposed of access to water. The Project addressed an important set of
barriers to girls’ and boys’ school attendance, which had been previously identified as a concern by
MEN and its partners, by tackling SRGBV. Generally speaking, the Project promoted the right to
education (CRC Art. 28), and the right to health and a safe environment (CRC Art. 24).
1.8. Lessons Learned
The evaluation identified the following lessons learned:
LL1. It is possible to reach the majority of schools in Guinea Bissau with support during an emergency,
with sufficient funding.
LL2. Tackling multiple barriers to education through a multi-sectoral intervention is an appropriate and
feasible approach.
8
LL3. A complex multi-sectoral project requires a dedicated project manager.
LL4. The mWater database proved to be a useful tool for data collection and monitoring in education.
LL5. Unconditional cash transfers are a relevant social protection initiative in Guinea-Bissau, but
baseline and endline studies for such an initiative should always be carried out within the same school
year.
LL6. Accelerated learning and distance learning are complex initiatives, which require time to test,
develop and assess new tools.
LL7. Schools need access to water. Therefore, attention to this aspect of school infrastructure is vital.
1.9. Recommendations
The following strategic and operational recommendations are supported by findings and conclusions.
Strategic recommendation 1: Ensure the integration of mWater with existing systems in MEN, for data
collection, planning, and monitoring by designating a focal point in MEN, training MEN staff on mWater
and advocating for usage among LEG partners (Users: MEN, UNICEF, LEG)
Strategic recommendation 2: Promote regional contingency plans on education in emergencies by
developping contingency plans in all 11 educational regions, contextualizing INEE Minimum Standards,
working closely with COMES and COGES and promoting a policy to stipulate incentives for teachers to
stay in their place of duty in case of school closure ( Users: MEN, UNICEF, LEG)
Strategic recommendation 3: Continue efforts to develop and systematize accelerated learning.by
considering in depth accelerated learning in the context of the forthcoming national strategy on out-
of-school children (Users: UNICEF, MEN, LEG)
Strategic recommendation 4: Continue efforts to develop and systematize distance learning by
conducting a feasibility study for a robust distance education system that includes digital technology,
integrating circular learning into distance learning methodologies (i.e., students’ responses) and
advocating for inclusion of Project tools in the current and future World Bank project (Users: UNICEF,
MEN, LEG)
Strategic recommendation 5: Promote water infrastructure in schools by engaging in resource
mobilization in favour of schools’ water infrastructure, strengthening the issue of access to water in
the Local Education Group and supporting the World Bank to map all school infrastructure. (Users:
LEG, UNICEF, MEN )
Strategic recommendation 6: Carry out a study on child labour and school attendance, jointly between
UNICEF Education and Child Protection Sections. (Users: UNICEF, MEN, LEG)
Strategic recommendation 7: Analyse the reasons for the lack of girls’ enrolment in Oio region, and
develop targeted interventions. (Users: UNICEF,MEN, LEG)
9
Strategic recommendation 8: Engage strategically with teachers’ unions, to create synergies and avoid
duplication of efforts, for example, in the provision of materials during an emergency. (Users: UNICEF,
LEG)
Operational recommendation 1: Identify "champions" among COGES, and promote peer-to-peer
education with other COGES, in order to promote good practice regarding school management,
particularly during an emergency. (Users: UNICEF, MEN)
Operational recommendation 2: Provide further support for community volunteers, particularly with
regards to distance learning, and monitor and evaluate their engagement, in order to strengthen the
link between schools and communities and to better prepare for an emergency. (Users: UNICEF, MEN)

2. Evaluation Context
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a
public health emergency of international concern under the International Health Regulations, and on
March 11, 2020, as a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted learning for over 89% of the
world’s student population. For more than 1.5 billion children in 188 countries, education has been
interrupted. The gains in expanding access to education and improving the quality of education were
in risk in being permanently compromised.
In Guinea-Bissau, the first cases of COVID-19 were recorded on 24 March 2020. Two years later, the
country recorded 8,186 positive cases, including 171 deaths. The capital Bissau and the regions of
Biombo and Bafatá remain the most affected. The most affected age group is 25-34 years old, followed
by 35-44 years old and, the disease seems to affect men more than women. When the first cases of
COVID-19 were detected in Guinea-Bissau, all educational institutions (from pre-school to higher
education) closed, reducing the learning time of students already affected by long and frequent
teacher strikes.
COVID-19 has indeed exacerbated a deep learning crisis. In Guinea-Bissau, 1 in 4 children of primary
school age (6-14 years) were out of school before the advent of COVID-19. When they are in school,
the level of achievement in school content is generally very low. The MICS data showed that only 1 in
10 children aged 7- 14 had mastery of basic literacy and numeracy skills.
In Guinea-Bissau, the education system faces many challenges: the system lacks inclusive and safe
school infrastructures, qualified human resources (a good proportion of the teaching staff have
no/limited background in pedagogy) and didactic and pedagogical resources. In recent years, teachers’
strikes have occurred more frequently and for longer durations, increasing the number of out-of-
school children and the risk of permanent drop-out.
For children, the lack of access to education can have lifelong impacts, creating a widening gap in
learning and reducing their ability to acquire skills that increase their employability. The World Bank
estimates that there will be a loss of income of US$10 trillion for the current cohort of children if this
learning crisis is not addressed.
To address these challenges in Guinea-Bissau, it was important to act on several levels and find
educational alternatives that allow out-of-school children to acquire foundational skills for their
personal and social development. With funding from the Global Partnership for Education, UNICEF
Guinea-Bissau has therefore supported the scaling up of the education sector response to mitigate the
impacts of the crisis on access and learning.
3. Evaluation Object
Guinea-Bissau received an emergency funding from the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) for a
total amount of USD 3,5 million. Initially designed to run for 18 months (from July 2020 to December
2021), the implementation cycle of the interventions covered by this funding was extended twice by a
total of ten months, until the end of October 2022.
The main objective of the Guinea-Bissau COVID-19 Education Sector Response project was to support

coronavirus on the education of children in the country by ensuring safe school operations and the
11
continuity of learning and well-being for children and youth, especially for the most vulnerable affected
by the outbreak.
This included the following specific objectives:
1. Support response coordination and real-time monitoring (focusing on the most vulnerable);
2. Ensure safe school operations including through hygiene supplies and risk communication;
3. Support continuity of learning through access to remote learning programs as appropriate for
Guinea Bissau;
4. Scale-up psychosocial, health, WASH, and nutrition services within the Education sector;
5. Ensure a safe opening-back of schools through back-to-school campaigns, catch-up classes,
and accelerated learning
6. Codify and disseminate best practice and innovation.

The key stakeholders of the project and their contributions are the following:
• Global Partnership for Education (GPE)
o The Global Partnership for Education contributed just under $3.5 million in funding for
the project
• Ministry of Education (MEN)
o The Ministry of Education was responsible for developing high-level policy and for
ensuring the coordination of the project amongst different stakeholders. The
Ministry led these coordination efforts through the Technical Implementation
Committee (or CTIP in Portuguese), which met frequently to coordinate project
implementation
• UNICEF
o UNICEF was the implementing agency for the Guinea-Bissau COVID-19 Education
Sector Response project. It was responsible for managing and disbursing the
project funds and liaising with the Ministry of Education to coordinate the
implementation. In addition to the education section, the WASH, Child Protection,
and Social Protection sections also provided technical support and implemented
components of the project.
• Local Education Group
o The Local Education Group (LEG) is a coordination mechanism led by the Ministry
of Education that ensures mutual accountability for the implementation of the
Education Sector Plan and the supervision of funds implemented with GPE
funding. The group includes include representation from all stakeholders including
local civil society organizations (CSOs), non-governmental organisations (NGOs),
donors, and multilateral agencies.
• Implementing Partners
o UNICEF worked with several NGOs and CSOs to implement components of the
project. These implementing partners worked to deliver results in narrow areas
where they have specific expertise, such as community mobilization and
sensitization.
o In addition, UNICEF entered in a partnership with the Calouste Gulbenkian
Foundation and the University of Minho to support MEN to accelerate the
development of alternative education curriculum and a distance learning strategy.
4. Evaluation Purpose and Objectives
4.1 Evaluation Purpose
This evaluation has two purposes: accountability and learning.
1. Accountability: This evaluation will provide both the donor (vertical accountability) and the
expected beneficiaries (horizontal accountability) with solid evidence regarding the extent to
which the Guinea-Bissau COVID-19 Education Sector Response attained its envisaged
objectives.
14
2. Learning: This summative evaluation, through the evidence-based knowledge generated, is
expected to inform the design and execution of new initiatives within the new Country
Programme. MEN, UNICEF, LEG partners, and the GPE will use the evidence-based findings of
the project evaluation to inform and improve the design, implementation, monitoring, and
assessment of future development and humanitarian programming in the education sector.
The following table summarizes the users and uses of the evaluation.

4.2. Evaluation Objectives
The objectives of this summative evaluation are as follows:
6. To determine the relevance, coherence, effectiveness, and efficiency of the Guinea-Bissau
COVID-19 Education Sector Response project.
15
7. To identify lessons learning regarding what worked and did not work during the
implementation of the project, including unexpected outcomes (positive and negative);
8. To critically analyse the theory of change and the extent to which its planned logical framework
and assumptions compare with the actual implementation and the results achieved;
9. To assess the extent to which the project integrated equity, human rights, and gender
principles into its design, implementation, and monitoring;
10. To formulate key recommendations regarding: (1) how to further strengthen the response to
the COVID-19 pandemic in Guinea-Bissau; (2) how to prepare for future education in
emergency (EiE) situations and make the education sector more resilient; and (3) how to better
implement future EiE interventions.
5. Evaluation Scope
5.1. Thematic scope
The summative evaluation of the Guinea-Bissau COVID-19 Education Sector Response project
examined all the intervention areas included in the project. This included not only all the activities
directly related to schools and learning, but also to the cross-sectoral interventions supported by the
project (for example, cash transfers, nutrition, WASH, and child protection). The focus was on the
extent to which the package of interventions was a coherent, relevant, efficient, and effective response
that increased access to quality learning during the COVID-19 pandemic (with a particular focus on the
most vulnerable).
5.2. Geographic scope
The project is national in scope; therefore, the evaluation included national level secondary data. The
document review included information covering all regions of the country.
The fieldwork included data collection in Bissau, Oio and Bafatá, the latter being one of the regions
with the poorest education indicators, based on MICS-6 data. The evaluation considered rural and
urban regions. In total, eight schools were visited:
• Bissau: 2 (2 urban)
• Oio: 3 (2 urban, 1 rural)
• Bafatá: 3 (1 urban, 2 rural)
5.3. Chronologic scope
The evaluation examined all the activities implemented from the launch of the project in July 2020
until the time of data collection in November 2022.

6. Evaluation Questions and Criteria
6.1. Evaluation criteria
This evaluation was guided by five OECD evaluation criteria: (A) relevance; (B) coherence; (C)
effectiveness; (D) efficiency; and (E) sustainability, as well as (F) an additional Gender, Equity and
Human Rights criterion. It should be noted that the evaluation criterion of impact was not included
because given the short duration and emergency focus of the project the impact would be difficult to
measure and assess.
Table 3: Overview of evaluation criteria
Relevance Measure of whether the objectives of a development intervention
match beneficiaries’ expectations, country needs, global priorities, as
well as partners’ and donors’ policies. It checks whether the activities
and results of the intervention are in line with the established programs
and correspond appropriately to the identified needs.
Coherence The compatibility of the intervention with other interventions in a given
country, sector or institution. It captures the extent to which other
interventions support or undermine the intervention, and vice versa. It
addresses the synergies and interconnections between the intervention
and other interventions carried out by the same institution, as well as
the intervention’s coherence with relevant international norms and
standards to which that institution adheres (internal coherence). It
considers the intervention’s coherence with the interventions of other
actors in the same context (external coherence). This includes
complementarity, harmonization and coordination with others, and the
extent to which the intervention is adding value while avoiding
duplication of effort.
Effectiveness Measure of whether the objectives of the development intervention
have been achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account
their relative importance. It measures the extent to which the aid
achieves its objectives. It is thus the relationship between the intended
objectives and the results achieved.
Efficiency Measure according to which resources are converted into results in the
most economical way, and whether there is value for money. Measures
the productivity of the intervention, in the sense that it will be most
efficient if it achieves its objectives at the lowest possible cost.
Sustainability Continuity in relation to the benefits resulting from a development
intervention, after its completion. Measures the likelihood that benefits
will endure over the long term. Aims to find out to what extent the
target groups can and want to take ownership of the results of that
intervention.
17
6.2. Evaluation questions
To achieve the purpose of the evaluation, the evaluation will seek to answer the following evaluation

2. To what extent has the project created or strengthened activities, platforms, mechanisms, or
competencies/capacities that will support the long-term development and system-
strengthening of the education sector?
3. To what extent was local capacity supported and developed by the project?
Equity, Gender and Human Rights
1. To what extent have the most vulnerable boys and girls from the most disadvantaged areas of
the covered municipalities benefited from the programme in the country?

taken into account in the design, planning, implementation, and monitoring of the programme
(for example, in relation to the participation of mothers and fathers, female and male teachers,
etc.)?
7. Methodology
7.1. Evaluation approach
The overall framework for the evaluation are the Core Commitments for Children in Humanitarian
Action1 (CCC), which include the strategic result: “Children and adolescents have access to inclusive,
quality education and learning in safe and protective environments.” In this regard, the CCC make
commitments for leadership and coordination, equitable access to learning, safe learning
environments, mental health and psychosocial support, strengthening of education systems, and
community engagement for behaviour and social change.
Within this framework, a mixed-methods approach was used to collect and analyze information for
the evaluation, consisting of a desk review, a review of learning and communication materials,
secondary quantitative data analysis, and primary qualitative data (semi-structured interviews, direct
observation, and focus groups). The evaluation used different lines of evidence and triangulation of
sources.
The methodology included the incorporation of gender, equity, and child rights principles in all stages
of the evaluation, including the design of data collection and analysis tools, involving an inclusive
sampling strategy of all stakeholders and beneficiaries of the project, and disaggregating the data by
age and gender.

7.2. Methods and data collection tools
7.2.1. Desk review
The desk review drew on information from progress reports, government circulars and other sources
and compare this with the initial project proposals and logical frameworks. This information was used
to obtain an overview of the programme, identify knowledge gaps, and help develop hypotheses about
relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability in the respective contexts. It also helped refine
the questions for the interviews and focus groups.
The reviewed documents are listed in Appendix 3.
7.2.2. Quantitative secondary data analysis
The evaluation carried out a quantitative analysis of existing data through the mWater database (used
to identify and monitor schools supported by the project), the cash transfers database, and enrolment
data from the Regional Directorates of Education (DRE) in Oio and Bafatá. It triangulated these data,
(including the enrolment statistics for the latest four school years, indicators for targeting beneficiaries
for the cash transfers, back-to-school campaign statistics), with the available qualitative data. To this
end, the quantitative and qualitative findings were compared, and in the case of discrepancies, further
clarification was sought from Project stakeholders.
The quantitative data analysis complemented the desk study in establishing the knowledge base and
oriented the primary data collection. For example, DRE officials were asked about the possible reasons
the fact that school enrolment did not decrease over the surveyed period of time, and children and
teachers in the focus groups in Oio region were asked why girls were still lagging behind.
7.2.3. Semi-structured interviews with key informants
Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 30 key stakeholders (four women, 25 men, and one boy)
from MEN at national and regional level, implementing agencies, UNICEF staff, school administrators,
the teachers’ union, students’ council, and representatives of the local community. The questions for
interviewees were specifically designed to reveal the extent of interviewees’ awareness of the
activities, perception of changes or improvements resulting from programme activities, and potential
lessons learned and good practices emerging from the project. The interview guides can be found in
the appendix.
7.2.4. Focus group discussions
A total of eight focus groups using interview guides with open-ended questions were conducted. Two
focus groups were conducted with teachers, four with students in grades 5 and 6 (aged 12 to 17), and
two with parents and community members, covering all aspects of the programme. The focus groups
with students were divided by gender.
For the focus groups with children, specific visual aids were used to get their ideas and feedback. More
specifically, the evaluator presented a sample of the tools distributed through the project, namely
leaflets and manuals, in order to refresh the children’s memory and elicit a response regarding the
utility of these tools. During the focus groups with children, the evaluator was mindful of the principles
of Ethical Research Involving Children (ERIC), including respect for the children’s views and their
20
cultures, treating all children involved in the evaluation equally, not unfairly excluding children, and
obtaining children’s informed and ongoing consent (see Section 7.5).
For focus groups with children and parents, translation into national languages was provided by
teachers and school administrators.
As with face-to-face interviews, focus groups helped fill gaps in knowledge identified during the desk
review and secondary data analysis. In addition, the focus groups provided an opportunity to explore
selected relevant topics in depth, for example, the following: changes in hygiene and sanitation;
communication between schools, students, parents, and communities; and measures required to
sustain the impact of the project.
In total, ten teachers (four women and six men) were interviewed in two focus groups, and 24 students
(12 girls and 12 boys) were interviewed in four focus groups. In addition, two parents (both women)
were interviewed in one focus groups. Each focus group lasted between 20 and 50 minutes.
7.2.5. Direct observation through school visits
Visits were made to eight schools in Bissau, Ojo and Bafatá, that had received support from the Project,
to observe the school environment, including water points and sanitation facilities, as well as the
hygiene practices of the students.2
The respective guide can be found in the appendix.
7.2.6. Review of learning and communication materials produced by the project
The evaluation reviewed learning and communication materials produced by the project, including
radio broadcasts and television lessons, as well as COVID-19 risk communication leaflets. The
evaluation looked at whether these materials were accessible, easy to use and/or understand, and
consistent with other project interventions.
The respective guide for the review of materials can be found in the appendix.
7.3. Sampling strategy
For reasons of time constraints, the evaluation focused on schools in the reasonably accessible areas
of Bissau, Oio, and Bafatá (in proximity to the main road from Bissau to Farim and Bafatá). Otherwise
said, the evaluation opted for a purposeful sampling strategy based on the selected intervention sites.
For face-to-face semi-structured interviews with key informants, a non-probabilistic method was used.
Participants were purposively identified based on UNICEF recommendations and through snowballing,
based on their knowledge of and participation in the Project. School administrators’ contacts in Oio
and Bafatá were provided by the respective DRE. The full list of people interviewed can be found in
the appendix.
For focus groups with community members (parents and children), a non-probabilistic method was
used. The selection of the eight schools (five from an urban environment and three from a rural
environment) was done through UNICEF (for schools in Bissau) and the DRE (for schools in Oio and
2 Contrary to what was indicated in the inception report, the evaluation was not able to visit two schools that
had not benefitted from the Project as a control group, because MEN did not provide contacts for these schools.
21
Bafatá), based on proximity and rural/urban diversity. Initially, it was planned to include in the sample
two schools that had not participated in the project, but the DRE did not facilitate these contacts.
Therefore, the evaluation made comparisons over time within the same schools (for example,
regarding school enrolment), rather than across participating versus non-participating schools.
For focus groups with teachers, a simple random selection was applied.
In the selected schools, the following total were carried out:
• Two focus groups with teachers
• Four focus groups with students (two with girls, and two with boys)
• One focus groups with parents and community members
• Eight semi-structured interviews with school administrators (see above)
Participants were selected on the basis of availability, and organized in collaboration with the
respective school administration, and the DRE.
Each focus group consisted of a random sample of teachers, students, or parents from the selected
schools. In the case of teachers and parents, participants were selected by availability. The focus
groups with students and members of the community were differentiated by gender, to facilitate the
free expression of women, men, boys, and girls. A questionnaire script was used for conducting the
focus groups and interviews; it can be found in the appendix
Adults and children were informed about the research and asked for oral consent as to the potential
collection of representative quotes for the final report, which would by no means be attributable.
During the focus group discussions, the evaluation ensured that children were listened to and
supported to express their views freely and in safety.

7.4. Data analysis and quality assurance
After presenting and receiving feedback on initial findings, the evaluation conducted a systematic
review and analysis of all data, identifying key themes, patterns, relationships, and explanations
relevant to the evaluation questions and indicators in the evaluation matrix (see Appendix 6).
The analysis was performed manually by a thorough review of interview and focus group transcripts,
secondary quantitative data analysis (using Excel), and direct observations. The analysis compared the
project objectives with the actual findings, using the evaluation matrix as a framework to organize data
and guide the analysis.
The evaluation used different lines of evidence and triangulation of sources. To this end, multiple
methods of data collection and analysis were used, including at least three lines of evidence for each
conclusion drawn by the evaluation in relation to a certain question from various data sources. In cases
where discordances were observed, the evaluator sought additional information. If the discordances
persisted, this was either explicitly mentioned in the report, or substituted with similar relevant
information.
To the extent possible, data was disaggregated by gender and age (data on disability groups and
socially excluded groups were not available).
7.5. Ethical Considerations and Principles
The evaluation adhered to the following ethical guidelines at all stages. Data collection and processing
were carried out in compliance with the UNEG Ethical Guidelines for Evaluation3 and its principles,
namely:
a. Independence: The evaluator is independent and has not been involved in project activities, nor has
he been responsible in the past for the design, execution or supervision of the project;
b. Impartiality: The evaluator endeavored to provide a comprehensive and balanced presentation of
the project's strengths and weaknesses. The evaluation process was unbiased at all stages, and took
into account all views received from stakeholders;
c. Transparency: The evaluator communicated as openly as possible the purpose of the evaluation, the
criteria applied and the expected use of the results with the interviewed stakeholders. The evaluation
report aims to provide transparent information on its sources, methods and approaches;
d. Disclosure: The evaluation report will serve as a mechanism by which the findings and lessons
identified in the evaluation are disseminated to policy makers, operational staff, beneficiaries, the
general public and other stakeholders;
e. Ethics: The evaluator respected the right of institutions and individuals to provide information in
confidence, and the sources of specific information and opinions contained in the report are not
disclosed, except where necessary and only after confirmation by the person consulted ;
f. Credibility: This assessment was based on data and observations that are considered reliable and
trustworthy with respect to the quality of the instruments, procedures and analyses used to collect
and interpret the information;
3 United Nations Evaluation Group: “Ethical Guidelines for Evaluation.” 2020.
23
g. Usefulness: The evaluator endeavoured to be as well informed as possible, and the report aims to
be beneficial to stakeholders, relevant, timely and concise.
Regarding the focus groups with children, the evaluator was particularly mindful of the following
aspects, in alignment with the principles of Ethical Research Involving Children (ERIC)4:
• The evaluation was respectful of children, their views and their cultures. The focus groups
recognised children’s status and evolving capacities and valued their diverse contributions.
• The evaluation was just and equitable towards children. All children involved in the evaluation
were treated equally, and children were not unfairly excluded.
• The evaluation ensured that children could not be harmed by their participation in the
evaluation.
• The evaluator obtained children’s informed and ongoing consent. Consent was based on a
balanced and fair understanding of what was involved throughout and after the evaluation
process. There were no indications of children’s dissent or withdrawal during the evaluation
process, which would have been respected.
Due to the fact that complex ethical challenges arising during the evaluation process were not
foreseen, the evaluation did not involve an ethical review at the national level.
7.6. Limitations and Mitigation Measures

8.Findings and Preliminary Conclusions (by criterion)
This chapter aims to answer the evaluation questions by criteria (relevance, coherence, effectiveness,
efficiency, sustainability, and equity, gender and human rights), presenting evidence for each question
and preliminary conclusions at the end of each criterion.
8.1. Relevance
Q1. To what extent did the project respond to the needs identified by the Ministry of Education, the
LEG, and other development partners, with regards to the COVID-19 pandemic’s negative impact on
the education sector?
Q2. To what extent are the logic and assumptions that underpinned the theory of change aligned with
the actual implementation of the project and its results achieved? What components of the logical

Q1. To what extent did the project respond to the needs identified by the Ministry of Education, the
LEG, and other development partners, with regards to the COVID-19 pandemic’s negative impact on
the education sector?
1. In May 2020, MEN, with the support of UNICEF, endorsed a Contingency Plan for the education
sector5 with the following main objective: “Create a strategy for the Guinea-Bissau education
system to respond the to the COVID-19 pandemic and guide all actors in: (a) contributing to
the reduction of the risk of the spread of COVID-19 in school communities; (b) identifying
concerted actions to be implemented as Covid-19 prevention and control measures; (c)
ensuring learning during the closure of schools; and (d) contributing to the strategy for the

25
recovery of the education system after the COVID-19 pandemic.” The semi-structured
interviews with MEN stakeholders confirmed that the Contingency Plan was widely regarded
as the main guiding document for the emergency measures during the Project period.
2. The Project was well aligned with the objectives of the Contingency Plan. In particular, the
Project’s outputs supported the four specific objectives laid out in the Contingency Plan, as
described in the following table.

Q2. To what extent are the logic and assumptions that underpinned the theory of change aligned with
the actual implementation of the project and its results achieved? What components of the logical
framework were and were not aligned with implementation realities?
3. Overall, the evaluation found that the Theory of Change (ToC, see Section 1.1.), as laid out in
the original project document6, was indeed logical and mostly aligned with implementation
realities, as all the elements of the ToC were translated into planned project outputs, the
majority of which were also implemented. Consequently, the goal of the ToC, “safe school
operations, continuity of learning and well-being for children and adolescents, especially for
the most vulnerable, will be guaranteed”, was largely achieved (see Section 4.3. on
Effectiveness).
4. However, two aspects of the Theory of Change were not fully aligned with implementation
realities. These are: “(iii) distance education strategies and educational alternatives are
developed and implemented to ensure the continuity of education in the event of school
closure”; and “(v) public and community school structures reopen, and propose recovery
classes and accelerated learning”. In practice, neither viable educational alternatives, nor
recovery classes, nor accelerated learning were widely implemented in a way that made them
accessible to all children, due to challenges in implementation (discussed further below).
5. Using the COVID-19 emergency situation as an entry point, the Project looked beyond the
short-term impact of the pandemic to address systemic challenges related to the resilience of
the education sector through a multi-sectoral approach. In particular, the ToC in the project
document stipulated that “(iv) services of water and sanitation, protection, psychosocial
support, health, nutrition and social inclusion are extended to the benefit of children from
1400 vulnerable households”. The evaluation considers this multi-sectoral approach highly
relevant, given the multitude of supply- and demand-side factors hampering education such
as household poverty, gender discrimination, difficulties in accessing school, etc., in Guinea-
Bissau,7 which are exacerbated during emergency situations, including teacher strikes.
6. However, the Project’s resilience aspect (although it is discussed in the Project document
narrative) was not made explicit in the Project objectives, i.e., neither in the main objective
(“to support the government of Guinea-Bissau and the Local Education Group (LEG) to reduce
the impact of the coronavirus on the education of children in the country by ensuring safe
school operations and the continuity of learning and well-being for children and youth,
especially for the most vulnerable affected by the outbreak”), nor within the specific project
objectives (see Section 1.1.).

7 See for example, Marshall et al: “Out-of-school children in Guinea-Bissau: A mixed-methods analysis.” In:
International Journal of Educational Development 77 (2020).

7. Therefore, the evaluation notes that a specific objective related to resilience should have been
explicitly included, along the lines of: “Enhance the resilience of the education sector in
Guinea-Bissau to respond to emergency situations”. This specific objective would have clarified
the main objective, strengthened the logic of the ToC, and aligned it more fully with the
implementation realities.
Q3. To what extent was the project flexible and responsive to changing contexts and needs, as identified
by the Ministry of Education and other partners?
8. Interviewed partners from MEN and the LEG confirmed that the Project communicated
transparently, acted flexibly, and engaged LEG partners democratically, mostly during online
meetings (due to COVID-19 restrictions on face-to-face meetings). A readjustment of the
Project was duly proposed to and accepted by the LEG in early 2022.8
9. One of the examples of the flexible approach adopted by the Project was the planned training
of teachers in accelerated teaching methods before the opening of schools with a budget of
US$ 250,000. With the opening of schools, the activity was considered no longer necessary by
UNICEF, MEN and the LEG, so funds were reallocated to the following activities, which were
more relevant at the time: (i) awareness-raising in the communities around the 1,500 targeted
schools through the training of volunteers and social mobilization sessions (US$ 80,000); (ii)
identification and production of essential content for the accelerated curriculum (US$ 50,000);
(iii) teacher training on the essential content (US$ 70,000); and (iv) learning assessments in
preschool and primary school (US$ 50,000).
10. Contrary to plan, it was not possible to call on technical partners to support MEN in conducting
the learning assessment. The PASEC team could not be hired, due to unpaid debts, and the
UNESCO team was no longer authorized to provide this type of support to country teams.9 To
remedy this situation, a learning assessment through a collaboration with the World Bank was
planned for 2022, which required an extension of the project beyond its original end in June
2022. The necessity for an extension of the project was compounded by frequent changes in
the leadership of MEN.10
11. Regarding the risk of duplication with other interventions, the Project actively sought a
dialogue with other partners. In particular, since the World Bank also planned an activity on
accelerated learning, the Project attempted to design its own activities in such a way as to
avoid duplications and create synergies.11 In terms of school feeding, the World Food
Programme (WFP) participated in the elaboration of the project and its validation. School
feeding programmes did not benefit from project funds, but complementary activities were
considered, the focus of which were also public primary schools.12

Preliminary Conclusions – Relevance
paragraph
REL1: The Project was well aligned with the Contingency Plan for the education
sector, supporting its main objectives and contributing to all four specific objectives 1-2
of the Contingency Plan.
REL2: The Project’s Theory of Change (ToC) was indeed logical and mostly aligned
with implementation realities, as all the elements of the ToC were translated into 3
planned project outputs, the majority of which were also implemented.
REL3: Neither viable educational alternatives, nor recovery classes, nor accelerated
learning were widely implemented in a way that made them accessible to all
4
children, due to challenges to implementation. These aspects of the ToC were not
fully aligned with implementation realities.
REL4: Given the multitude of supply- and demand-side factors hampering education
in Guinea-Bissau, the multi-sectoral approach taken by the Project was highly 5
relevant for tackling these multi-dimensional barriers.
REL5: A specific objective related to resilience should have been explicitly included in
6-7
the ToC. This would have made the Project’s relevance clearer.
REL6: The Project communicated transparently, acted flexibly, and engaged LEG
partners democratically. In this way, the continued relevance of the Project was 8-9
promoted.

8.2. Coherence
Q1. To what extent are the goals aligned with the national planning objectives/national strategies
concerning the education sector?
Q2. To what extent did the activities implemented by the project complement existing interventions
and services or education sector policies?
Q3. How complementary are the project’s interventions with actions undertaken by the Ministry of
Education or other line ministries to address the impact of COVID-19 on education or other sectors?
Q1. To what extent are the goals aligned with the national planning objectives/national strategies
concerning the education sector?
12. The evaluation found that the overall and specific objectives of the initiative are fully aligned
with government priorities and national policies. In particular, the Project was aligned with the
national Education Sector Plan 2017-2025.13 The Project contributed Strategic Priority 1 of the
Plan: “Seek quality basic universal education, expanding basic education according to the Basic
Law and ensuring that disparities are reduced.” In effect, all Project outputs supported this
strategic priority, including both access and quality aspects, particularly through its multi-
sectoral approach.
13. In addition, the planned interventions related to distance learning (Output 3) and accelerated
learning (Output 5) also supported Priority 2 of the Education Sector Plan: “Improve the quality
and relevance of teaching/learning at all levels.” However, these interventions were only
partly realized.

14. The Project was also aligned with the UNICEF Country Programme Document 2016-2020,14 in
particular with the goal of supporting education equity and quality: “The programme will
ensure that all children in every region have access to inclusive and comprehensive education
services. Priority will be given to entry into primary school at the right age, increased primary
school retention, completion rates and transition to secondary education, especially for girls
in areas with high rates of child marriage.” In this regard, the Project supported particularly
the aspect of increased primary school retention.
Q2. To what extent did the activities implemented by the project complement existing interventions
and services or education sector policies?
15. The Project was coherent with the Education Sector Program Implementation Grant (ESPIG)
2017-2025.15 First, it complemented ESPIG Component 1 “Strengthen school-based
management practices and empower communities” through the engagement of community
volunteers (Project Outputs 2 and 3). Second, the Project complemented ESPIG Component 3
“Strengthen education management capacity” through the promotion of coordination within
MEN and the training of MEN staff on education in emergencies (Output 1).
16. The Project was also coherent with the Child-Friendly Schools (CFS) initiative, which was
implemented in two phases from 2011 to 2020.16 The CFS initiative focussed on WASH
interventions and community participation (among other aspects), which were also elements
of the Project (Outputs 4 and 2, respectively).
17. As a follow-up to the recommendations from the final evaluation of the CFS initiative, the
Project successfully advocated for the integration of the National Quality Standards (NQS)
module developed by MEN into the training of COVID-19 operational teams in schools.17
18. The Project was also in line with the intention stated in the CPD to strengthen the collaboration
between the education and child protection sectors. In this regard, the Project included
activities to address sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) in schools in Output 4,
addressing a need which had been identified by MEN and partners prior to the pandemic, by
“seizing a perfect opportunity”, according to the Chief of Child Protection in UNICEF.18
19. The Project also leveraged synergies with the facilities of the already established youth project
“Adolescent Girls Education Empowerment and Participation Project”. Awareness-raising
about COVID-19 among impoverished communities was conducted by adapting the
communication training of youth volunteers and supporting them in reaching out to
communities to address needs arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.19
20. The Project also accelerated other reforms previously discussed by MEN and partners,
particularly in relation to the development of a national strategy for distance learning to

benefit out-of-school children and the implementation of catch-up programmes to minimize
the loss of learning due to the impact of COVID-19 on children's education.20
Q3. How complementary are the project’s interventions with actions undertaken by the Ministry of
Education or other line ministries to address the impact of COVID-19 on education or other sectors?
21. To reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus, the Government declared a state of emergency
in March 2020 and announced for the closing of sea and air transportation and borders by
land. The government also implemented guidelines and laws to prevent the spread of the
COVID-19 virus within the community. These laws limited social gatherings, and screenings
were made available to detect the COVID-19 virus.21 Some critics argued that the pandemic
was “turned into a security issue when it should be treated as a health and human right
concern. Far from protecting the population, the emergency measures compound social
inequalities in Guinea-Bissau.”22
22. The Government of Guinea-Bissau also developed a National COVID-19 Contingency Plan. The
Plan focuses on scaling-up and strengthening all aspects of preparedness and response
including emergency coordination, health vigilance, communication and social mobilization,
prevention and infection control and clinical management.23 The Plan was supported by the
World Bank through the COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Project, which aims to
strengthen the national public health preparedness capacity to prevent, detect and respond
to the COVID-19 and future public health emergencies in Guinea-Bissau.24
23. It is important to note that the social safety net system in Guinea-Bissau remains cobweb thin,
with 96 percent of the budget provided by development partners. The non-contributory social
assistance programmes include cash transfer, school feeding and critical health interventions.
To mitigate the immediate impacts of the pandemic, the Government (as of March 2021),
made emergency allocations of XOF222 million (US$ 0.4 million) to provide medicine, food,
and medical equipment; and XOF580 million (US$ 1 million) to distribute 20,000 bags of rice
and 10,000 bags of sugar throughout the country, including in distant areas. As additional
actions, the Government increased the targeted number of families to benefit from food
support from an initial 3,000 to 20,000 and has provided other support to families (XOF 100
million).25 Meanwhile, the implementation of the Contingency Plan for education relied largely
on the main donors in the education sector, i.e., UNICEF and the World Bank.
24. In response to the socio-economic challenges linked with the pandemic, the UN Country Team
(UNCT) issued a Socio-economic Response Plan, which includes Education and psychosocial
support under Pillar 2 “Protecting People”. The Plan urges to “support secured learning for all
children and adolescents.”26 The Project is fully coherent with this approach.

25. The main objective of the Project was: “to support the government of Guinea-Bissau and the
Local Education Group (LEG) to reduce the impact of the coronavirus on the education of
children in the country by ensuring safe school operations and the continuity of learning and
well-being for children and youth, especially for the most vulnerable affected by the outbreak.”
By extending services to more than 1,500 schools (out of approximately 2,300), the Project did
35
indeed make an important contribution to ensuring safe schools operations and the continuity
of learning.
26. Figures 1 and 2 depict the initial and final enrolment in the school years 2018/19 until 2021/22
in Bafatá region and 2018/19 until 2020/21 in Oio region (where data for the school year
2021/22 was not yet available) for all grades (pre-school until grade 12). The results show that
the COVID-19 pandemic has not had the negative effect of lowering enrolment in these two
regions. On the contrary, both initial and final enrolment have grown in each school year, for
both sexes (with the exception of a drop in enrolment in Oio between the school years 2018/19
and 2019/20, which happened prior to COVID-19). This could be interpreted as the Project’s
success in preventing a negative effect of COVID-19 on the education system, at least in terms
of enrolment. This finding would be consistent with several interviewed school directors, who
confirmed that the hygienic materials, together with the sensitization of the school
community, had prevented dropout and motivated children to return when school re-opened.

27. However, care should be taken in attributing the apparent resilience of enrolment rates
entirely to the Project. First, it is possible that the high enrolment rates are due to an increase
in the age cohorts, and that the percentage of out-of-school children may have also increased
(current data on out-of-school children were not available). Second, it is also possible that the
enforced restrictions on pupil-to-classroom rates during the pandemic have led many schools
to adopt (or re-adopt) a multiple-shift schedule, allowing them to enrol more children, at the
expense of overall instruction time and therefore education quality. This was confirmed by a
school director in one of the visited schools. In any case, the way the main objective was
phrased (“to support the government of Guinea-Bissau and the Local Education Group (LEG)
to reduce the impact…”) means that Project can be considered effective in this regard.
28. Regarding Specific Objective 1 “Support response coordination and real-time monitoring
(focusing on the most vulnerable)”, the evaluation notes that there was indeed MEN
ownership of the Contingency Plan, upon which the Project was built. The Project was
successful in establishing the CTIP, which coordinated the Project, ensuring effective
coordination among different departments and ownership within MEN. However, it started
functioning properly only in January 2021, when a dedicated project manager took office in
UNICEF.27 The CTIP met 78 times, and conducted nine joint monitoring visits until May 2022.28
The CTIP is still functional, and MEN leadership is considering an even more prominent role for
this committee, which may oversee the development, implementation and monitoring of the
Education Sector Plan.
29. Moreover, the Project prompted the use of the mWater database for the education sector,
which facilitated the monitoring of school supplies and other interventions during the
implementation of the Project.29 It offers increased possibilities for real-time monitoring of
education indicators through data collection, storage, and visualisation, going forward.

30. Regarding Specific Objective (2) “Ensure safe school operations including through hygiene
supplies and risk communication”, the Project trained nearly 7,500 school stakeholders on
hygiene, water and basic sanitation matters and distributed key documents, tools and
equipment to partners, enabling a safe reopening of schools in October 2020.30 Visits to
schools in Bissau, Oio and Bafatá confirmed that the hygiene materials had arrived in all visited
schools in sufficient quantities, and that most schools had the thermometer and first aid kits
readily available. Moreover, the communication was clear regarding the risks and prevention
measures was considered clear, as was confirmed by all the interviewed stakeholders at the
school level. Students in the focus groups confirmed that they felt safe with the masks,
knowing that they should not hug or shake hands with their peers. Students in Escola Ponta
Nova said that they even taught their out-of-school peers basic hygiene skills.
31. Regarding Specific Objective (3) “Support continuity of learning through access to remote
learning programmes as appropriate for Guinea-Bissau”, the Project produced distance
learning materials for children at pre-school and first cycle of basic education via radio and TV
of good quality. However, the evaluation notes that current access to TV in Guinea-Bissau is
insufficient to allow for wide access to these distance-learning materials across the country
(due to the economic capacity of households and the availability of electricity, among other
aspects); the same is true to a lesser extent for radio access. Nonetheless, UNICEF estimates
that some 154,473 children benefited from videos and audios on the country's national radio
and television in 2020.31 Likewise, 216 radio lessons from an existing programme by Child Radio
Foundation were translated and adapted to the Bissau-Guinean context and benefited more
than 300,000 children, in and out of school, and their parents, according to UNICEF estimates.32
However, the evaluation notes that the above estimates, which are based on population data
and available hardware, are rather speculative, and that the impact of these interventions
cannot be properly measured. Only one of the children interviewed in the focus groups (who
had stayed in Bissau at the time) said that she had followed one of the lessons.
32. Apart from the restricted coverage radio, the evaluation questions the pedagogical value of
reliance on “one-way” channels of education for quality learning.33 In this regard, the Project
was not able to conduct a learning assessment. Nonetheless, the Project improved chances for
learning continuity, even with other types of disruptions to fragile education system, notably
teacher strikes, by enhancing the pool of available materials, raising awareness among
stakeholders, and training volunteers.34
33. Teachers in the focus groups affirmed that they would require more training on both logistical
and didactical aspects of distance learning. In the absence of such training, they would
otherwise not feel confident in conducting distance learning, according to the teachers.
34. In any case, it should be noted that the relevance of Specific Objective 3 was decreased by the
fact that schools were able to reopen relatively quickly, so that the need for distance-learning
was diminished. (As noted in Section 8.1, the Project responded flexibly to this shift in
relevance.)

35. Regarding Specific Objective (4) “Scale-up psychosocial, health, WASH, and nutrition services
within the Education sector”, the Project was partly effective. On the positive side, the
materials and activities under Output 2 increased the availability of hygiene supplies in schools
and promoted hygienic behaviour. In addition, 20 new fixed handwashing devices were
installed, which were valuable also for teaching purposes. The evaluator witnessed students’
washing their hands on these devices as well as on the plastic water containers (which were
distributed to all schools) and verified that they were able to demonstrate the correct way of
applying soap to the hands in the focus groups. The regional coordinator of inspection in Bafatá
confirmed that there was now more awareness of the importance of hygiene among all school
actors.
36. The Project increased awareness and capacity on school-related gender-based violence
(SRGBV) at school. An SRGBV manual was developed, and made available to teachers in all
1,500 schools. Moreover, 302 education stakeholders (teachers, directors, and COGES
members) participated in a one-day training event on SRGBV. The interviewed directors and
teachers were highly satisfied with the training. The director of one of the visited schools even
noted that teachers had spent time in class sensitizing students, and that there had been
several incidents where students had kept other students from mistreating their peers.
Teachers at Escola Amizade China in Bafatá also affirmed that all students in their school had
been sensitized on the issue.
37. The engagement for a shock-responsive social protection scheme through cash transfers for
families and children relieved families from financial constraints, allowing children to continue
schooling, especially at-risk girls. The Project engaged several CSOs, which provided intensive
follow-up, for example advice and guidance on how to invest the cash transfers received. For
example, the CSO Associação de Saneamento Básico, Proteção da Água e Ambiente de Bafatá
(ASPAAB) agreed with some beneficiaries to pay the school fees of CFA 1,000 per month35 for
two years in advance, testified by a community representative (in case the school
administration changes), while others bought goats as an investment. According to ASPAAB,
twelve community schools were reactivated in Bafatá for one or two school years with cash
transfer money, which was pooled among beneficiaries.
38. On the negative side, the evaluation visited three out of the 20 schools with fixed handwashing
devices, finding that only the one at Escola São Pedro de Jugundul was currently operational
(the one at Escola Ponta Nova was broken, whereas the one at Escola Gan Teuda was currently
non-operational, due to the unavailability of water in the respective school). While all of the
eight visited schools had received plastic water containers, four of these were broken (and in
two schools replaced).
39. The design of the cash transfer intervention should have yielded quantitative and qualitative
evidence regarding the effectiveness of this intervention. However, the delayed timing of the
endline survey at the beginning of the new school year made it impossible to assess the impact
on school enrolment (and other variables).
40. While the Project had intended to scale up nutrition in school, this was not achieved. Instead,
the funds were used to build capacity in the Ministry of Health, which did not directly benefit
children in schools.36 In particular, as mentioned in Section 8.1., the Project did not achieve a

joint activity with the World Food Programme (WFP) or Catholic Relief Services (CRS) on
school-feeding, which represents a missed opportunity.
41. Another potentially missed opportunity was the option to address child labour (apart from the
Back to School Campaign, which included various factors that favor school dropout),
particularly in cashew production, which has been identified as one of the main reasons for
children dropping out of schools in some regions.37 This was confirmed in the focus group
discussions with students, who confirmed that some of their peers had dropped out of school
due to child labour.
42. Regarding Specific Objective (5) “Ensure a safe opening-back of schools through back-to-school
campaigns, catch-up classes, and accelerated learning”, the Project was effective: Schools re-
opened safely in the school years 2020/21 and 2021/22, with a higher number of students than
in the previous years in the regions of Oio and Bafatá (where such data were available) (see
Figure 1 and 2).
43. The back-to-school campaign was carried out three times, in 2020, 2021, and 2022, and
reached a large number of people, especially adults aged 30 and above. More than half of the
population aged 30 and above said that they had heard of the campaign in 2022 (Figure 3).

44. In August and September 2022, the Project produced and disseminated four radio spots before
the school opening date; printed 4,500 posters, 1,000 stickers for distribution in schools, and
ten rollups (out of which eight for DREs); disseminated promotional videos and other posts
through social media; and organized awareness-raising “Djumbai” sessions with parents and
community leaders.38
45. In response to the question “What are the two most important aspects of the campaign that
you remember?”, respondents highlighted in particular (a) the importance of children
returning to school and inscription at the age of 6, and (b) the right of children to education,
regardless of sex, age, or socioeconomic status (Figure 4).

46. All the students in the focus groups in the visited schools said that they had received notice
when the schools reopened as part of the back-to-school campaign in 2020, mostly via radio
or telephone, and that they had been eager to return. The COGES representative at one of the
schools said that the campaign had brought new students into the system (however, some had
been also turned away, due to supply-side restrictions).
47. However, neither catch-up classes nor accelerated learning were implemented as planned,
which was largely due to the complex nature of these interventions. Nonetheless, the Project
promoted the design and implementation of catch-up programmes through the development
and printing of teacher guides and textbooks, and building capacity within MEN, which
enhanced the likelihood of providing alternatives to minimize the loss of learning due to the
impact of COVID-19, teacher strikes, or other emergencies, in the future.39
48. Regarding Specific Objective (6) “Codify and disseminate best practice and innovation”, no
output was specifically dedicated to this objective, and the evaluation found little evidence of
targeted activities geared towards this end, apart from the mid-term evaluation and the
present final evaluation. The baseline and endline study on conditional cash transfers would
have provided an excellent opportunity to enhance the knowledge base and establish clear
evidence on the effectiveness of such a social protection initiative, which is linked to education.
However, as noted above, the timing of the baseline and endline study over two different
schoolyears did not allow for determining the impact of this initiative on enrolment.
Q2. What are the factors (internal and external to the project) that most contributed to the attainment
of the project’s objectives?
49. Several interviewees confirmed that the Project had demonstrated MEN’ commitment to
support schools, thereby instilling confidence within schools and communities that the risks

2022.
42
posed by the virus could be overcome. This was an important factor for the continuation of
education at the local level.
50. With regards to the central level, the alignment with Contingency Plan, for which MEN has
ownership, was identified as an important contributing factor for taking ownership for the
Project, too. The manifestation of this ownership was the establishment of the CTIP, which
met regularly and undertook several monitoring visits to the field.
51. The multi-sectoral nature of interventions engaged various government counterparts and
section inside UNICEF, which created possibilities to address the complex set of supply- and
demand-side factors hampering education in Guinea-Bissau.40 The multi-sectoral approach
made activities geared towards improvements to the school environment possible, through
the provision of resources and training to address inclusion, corporal punishment, school-
related gender-based violence (SRGBV), and menstrual hygiene management (MHM).41
52. The use of the mWater database facilitated the localisation of schools, which was in some
cases not known at the level of the Regional Directorates of Education.42 Moreover, the
mWater served as an effective tool to monitor distribution of Project items and services.43
53. Initially, the donor had asked the question whether the cash transfer initiative could be made
conditional on school attendance.44 However, the Project rejected this idea and designed the
cash transfer initiative in an unconditional way. The evaluation found this decision
appropriate, given the limited local capacity required to administer a conditional cash transfer
programme. Moreover, international experience has shown that unconditional cash transfers
can have similar results on school attendance as conditional ones; they are also in line with
UNICEF social protection policies.45
Q3. What are the factors (internal and external to the project) that most hindered the attainment of
the project’s objectives?
54. The Project was initially slowed down by the fact that a full-time project manager did not come
on board until February 2021, i.e., eight months after the beginning of the Project.46 The
evaluation found that the complexity of the Project, with its five outputs and various sectors
and partners involved, made this recruitment necessary, and that the delay in recruitment
explains a large share of the delays encountered during implementation. In addition, it is
important to note that due to COVID-19 restrictions on mobility, access to the UNICEF office
was limited from March to November 2020, with all staff working from home, some in
conditions not suitable for monitoring a project.47
55. The Project was also hampered by low absorption and implementation capacity of MEN, which
was manifested in the lack of a robust list of schools, for example.48 The low capacity was

further exacerbated by frequent leadership changes, both at the ministerial and the
departmental level. For example, four different Ministers of Education were appointed in 2022
(three of whom actually took office).49 The personnel changes slowed implementation down,
when the incoming minister or staff re-assessed MEN strategic priorities.50
56. The lack of access to water at most schools in Guinea-Bissau posed a significant obstacle to the
WASH-related aspects of the Project (under Outputs 2 and 4).
57. During the first half of 2021, the Government imposed the payment of customs clearance fees
on all partners, which delayed the delivery of some of the materials.51 A few other delays
occurred at the time of distribution, when some schools could initially not be identified by the
transporters.52
58. Contrary to plan, it was not possible to call on technical partners to support MEN in conducting
the learning assessment.53 Specifically, the PASEC team could not be hired, due to unpaid
debts, and the UNESCO team was no longer authorized to provide this type of support to
country teams. To remedy this situation, a learning assessment through a collaboration with
the World Bank was planned for 2022, which required an extension of the project beyond its
original end in June 2022; nonetheless, the activity was not effectively implemented, as it
proved too complex.54
59. The Project was very ambitious with regards to the specific objectives described above, which
aimed to tackle some of the deep-rooted obstacles to providing quality education to all
children. On the one hand, this is laudable, particularly considering current reforms inspired
by the World Humanitarian Summit, which focus on “new ways of working” that bridge
humanitarian action, development, peace, and security in a “nexus” approach.55 On the other
hand, the evaluation concludes that the result that several specific objectives were not fully
achieved was due to the fact that the Project was overly ambitious, given the challenging
context described above.
Q4. What are the unexpected outcomes (positive and negative) of the project’s implementation?
60. Prior to the Project, MEN did not have a trusted list of schools, which became apparent when
the original list of schools to receive hygiene supplies was submitted to UNICEF. In fact, many
schools on the original list were no longer existent, whereas other schools were missing.
Through the use of the mWater database, MEN now disposes of a trusted list of schools.
61. The Project fostered the accountability of governance in the education sector. According to
the UNICEF Project Manager, key MEN actors at the national level, through their participation
in CTIP monitoring missions to the field, were more sensitized to the reality on the ground. In

particular, they realized that the functioning of schools and DRE was worse than envisioned,
for example regarding the poor state of infrastructure and the lack of monitoring visits by
inspectors.56 As a result, the overall budget allocation to decentralized structures was recently
augmented.57
62. Linked with the previous finding, the Project promoted awareness of the importance of WASH
in schools and enhanced the momentum to provide water infrastructure accordingly. As a
result, MEN conducted a re-assessment of water infrastructure in schools in late 2020,58 and
discussions with the World Bank regarding possible investment in WASH are ongoing.

Preliminary Conclusions – Effectiveness
paragraph
EFE1: The main objective (“to support the government of Guinea-Bissau and the
Local Education Group (LEG) to reduce the impact of the coronavirus on the
education of children in the country by ensuring safe school operations and the
continuity of learning and well-being for children and youth, especially for the most
vulnerable affected by the outbreak”) and three out of six specific objectives were 25-27
nearly fully reached: (1) Support response coordination and real-time monitoring
(focusing on the most vulnerable); (2) Ensure safe school operations including
through hygiene supplies and risk communication; (4) Scale-up psychosocial, health,
WASH, and nutrition services within the Education sector.
EFE2: Three specific objectives were partially reached: (3) Support continuity of
learning through access to remote learning programmes as appropriate for Guinea-
Bissau; (5) Ensure a safe opening-back of schools through back-to-school campaigns,
catch-up classes, and accelerated learning; (6) Codify and disseminate best practice
28-48
and innovation. In particular, accelerated learning was not fully implemented, while
the effectiveness of distance learning was doubtful, given the restricted access and
lack of circular learning. Best practice and innovation were addressed only through a
brief mid-term evaluation and the present final evaluation.
EFE3: The Project had demonstrated the MEN’ commitment to support schools,
thereby instilling confidence within schools and communities that the risks posed by 49
the virus could be overcome.
EFE4: Other factors that promoted the effectiveness of the Project were the
alignment with the Contingency Plan, the multi-sectoral nature of interventions, and 50-53
the use of the mWater database.

EFE5: The Project was initially slowed down by the fact that a full-time project
manager did not come on board until February 2021, i.e., eight months after the
54
beginning of the Project. In addition, the Project was hampered by COVID-19
restrictions on access and mobility.
EFE6: Other factors that hampered the effectiveness of the Project were the low
absorption and implementation capacity of MEN, leadership turnover in MEN, the
55-58
lack of water at school level, transportation problems, and the non-availability of
previously planned partnerships to conduct a learning assessment.
EFE7: Regarding unexpected outcomes, the Project facilitated a trusted list of schools
for MEN and its partners, fostered the accountability of governance in the education 60-62
sector, and promoted awareness of the importance of WASH in schools.
8.4 Efficiency
Q1. To what extent were the financial, human and property resources:
a. sufficient (in terms of quantity) in relation to the identified needs and expected results?
b. adequate (in terms of quality) in relation to the expected results?
c. implemented in a timely manner?
Q2. To what extent could the same results be achieved by other less expensive alternatives?
Q3. What are the management factors that favoured or hindered the efficiency of the project?

46
a. sufficient (in terms of quantity) in relation to the identified needs and expected results?
b. adequate (in terms of quality) in relation to the expected results?
c. implemented in a timely manner?
63. Initially designed to run for 18 months (from July 2020 to December 2021), the implementation
cycle of the Project was extended twice by a total of ten months, until the end of October
2022, due to the implementation challenges described above. Considering the challenges that
led to these extensions (see Section 8.3, Paragraphs 54-59), the timeliness of the
implementation can be considered satisfactory. By June 2022 (i.e., six months after the
originally planned end, and four months before the actual end of the Project), the Project
managed to disburse 95.3 percent of the budget.
64. The overall distribution of the planned and revised budget is depicted in Figure 5. Within the
planned budget, Output 2 (sanitization of schools) and Output 4 (multi-sectoral services)
received the largest share of the budget, with 38 percent and 33 percent, respectively. The
remaining outputs received a smaller share, with Output 5 accounting for 10 percent, Output
3 for 10 percent, and Output 1 for only 4 percent of the total budget.

65. A budget revision was undertaken during the programme. Initially, it was planned to train
teachers in accelerated teaching methods before the opening of schools (Output 5) with a
budget of US$ 250,000. With the opening of schools, the activity was considered no longer
necessary, so funds were reallocated to the following activities: (i) awareness-raising in the
communities around the 1,500 targeted schools through the training of volunteers and social
mobilization sessions (US$ 80,000); (ii) identification and production of essential content for
the accelerated curriculum (US$ 50,000); (iii) teacher training on the essential content (US$
70,000); and (iv) learning assessments in preschool and primary school (US$ 50,000).
66. Thus, the budget revision shifted the relative share of the budget from Output 3 to Output 5.
• Output 2: 38 percent
• Output 4: 33 percent
47
• Output 5: 14 percent
• Output 1: 4 percent
• Output 3: 4 percent
67. Given the main objective to ensure safe school operations and the continuity of learning and
well-being, the evaluation finds the emphasis on Output 2, which has a clear short-term focus,
appropriate. Likewise, the fact that a large share of the budget was also attributed to Output
4 was also justifiable, given the complexity of tackling barriers to education in a multi-sectoral
manner. Since Output 4 has a more medium-term focus, this provided balance within the
overall Project.
68. As discussed above, Outputs 3 and 5 were the most ambitious. Distance learning and
accelerated education are difficult to integrate into an existing education system, even in non-
emergency situations; during the pandemic, these interventions were only able to achieve an
experimental status. In this regard, the evaluation finds the fact that both outputs received a
relatively small amount of the budget also appropriate.
69. Initially, UNICEF colleagues had proposed a substantial investment in WASH infrastructure as
part of the Project. However, this was not accepted by the donor, due to the high costs
involved. Instead, fixed handwashing devices were only installed in 20 schools that already had
access to water. While this was very efficient, it may have exacerbated existing inequalities
(see Section 4.6.).
Q2. To what extent could the same results be achieved by other less expensive alternatives?
70. The evaluation found no indications of other less expensive alternatives. According to the
reviewed documents and the interviewed stakeholders, the Project employed the most cost-
effective means to achieve its objectives.
Q3. What are the management factors that favoured or hindered the efficiency of the project?
71. The efficiency of the Project was facilitated by the installation of the CTIP. This coordination
mechanism met regularly and carried out several monitoring missions to the field, which
increased ownership. As a result of the trust that MEN leadership puts in this mechanism, CTIP
has recently been given further responsibilities (see Section 8.3).
72. The multi-sectoral approach was made efficient by building on existing initiatives within
UNICEF. For example, a partnership with Child Fund on radiophonic lessons had already started
in 2019. Likewise, discussions between MEN and the UNICEF Child Protection Section
regarding SRGBV had also taken place prior to the project,59 while deworming was scaled up
from 27 CFS schools to reach all children until 5th grade in the Project schools.60
73. However, the evaluation noted the lack of involvement of the teacher unions, for example the
National Teachers’ Union (SINAPROF), which also provided materials to schools and capacity-
building to teachers (funded by international partner organisations) in 2020. Coordination with
teacher unions could have created synergies and enhanced the efficiency of the intervention.

74. The evaluation noted that the use of mWater, which was discussed in the previous section,
was also an efficient approach, as the database was already established and provided a low-
cost tool for the collection, storage, and analysis of cross-sectoral data.

Preliminary Conclusions – Efficiency
paragraph
EFI1: Considering the challenges to implementation (low absorption capacity,
frequent leadership changes, and customs clearance problems, among others),
63
which led to two extensions, the timeliness of the Project’s implementation can be
considered satisfactory.
EFI2: The largest shares of the budget went to Output 2 (Sanitization of schools) and
Output 4 (Multi-sectoral services), which is justifiable, given the close linkage
64-67
between Output 2 and the overall objective of continuing education, and the
complexity of a multi-sectoral approach.
EFI3: Due to the high costs involved with water infrastructure, fixed handwashing
devices were only installed in 20 schools that already had access to water. This was 70
efficient, even though it may have exacerbated existing inequalities.
EFI4: The efficiency of the Project was facilitated by the installation of the Technical
Committee for the Implementation of the Contingency Plan (CTIP), synergies with 71-72, 74
existing initiatives within UNICEF, and the use of mWater.

8.5 Sustainability
Q1. To what extent has the capacity of the education sector (and actors) been strengthened to reduce
the risk from disasters, increase preparedness and resiliency, and ensure continuity of access to
education and learning and educational services during emergency situations?
Q2. To what extent has the project created or strengthened activities, platforms, mechanisms, or
competencies/capacities that will support the long-term development and system-strengthening of
the education sector?
Q3. To what extent was local capacity supported and developed by the project?
Q1. To what extent has the capacity of the education sector (and actors) been strengthened to reduce
the risk from disasters, increase preparedness and resiliency, and ensure continuity of access to
education and learning and educational services during emergency situations?
75. At the national level, the Project provided an experience on how to operate logistically in an
emergency, involving all directorates within MEN. On this basis, it can be expected that
valuable lines of communication were developed or reinforced, upon which a similar
intervention could draw on logistically. This hypothesis was confirmed by several respondents
from UNICEF and MEN.
76. At the national level, the Project provided capacity-building on education in emergencies,
using the International Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE) Minimum Standards.
However, given time and resource constraints, these standards were not adapted to the
context of Guinea-Bissau (which would require an extensive process of context analysis,
50
stakeholder mapping and consultations, etc.), so it is not clear how stakeholders in the regions
would be able to apply these standards, in case of another emergency. In particular, the
Project did not facilitate any contingency plans at the regional level, where school inspection,
data collection and other key education services are coordinated and contextualised.
Therefore, the development of contingency plans at the regional level remain a priority for
future action.61 During field visits to Oio and Bafatá, directors and inspectors at the DRE in Oio
and Bafatá did not provide any plausible ideas, when asked if and how they would act
differently if another emergency occurred.
77. The TV and radio lessons produced can be considered valuable for the sustainability of the
Project, at least with regards to the capital region (given the poor access in many other
regions). The manager of the education project led by the World Bank confirmed the likely use
of these materials for distance learning interventions during the second phase of the
respective project (starting in 2025). As mentioned in Section 8.3, the Project thus improved
chances for learning continuity, even with other types of disruptions to fragile education
system, notably teacher strikes. Two MEN stakeholders confirmed the Ministry’s ownership of
the TV and radio lessons and expressed their intention to use these materials in the future.
78. The cash transfer initiative may well have been “catalytic in opening up new possibilities for
the development of a Social Protection System in Guinea Bissau under the Social Inclusion
Programme from 2022”, according to the Country Office Annual Report 202162. However, the
evaluation was not able to validate this assumption, due to a lack of data.
79. The mWater database has the potential to alleviate weaknesses in national education data
systems and provide much needed information on the sector to guide and monitor action, for
example, a dependable list of schools, water infrastructure, and delivery of school-related
items.63 Furthermore, the open access model is free to the end user cost, meaning there is no
ongoing operating cost. As the developer of the portal explains, mWater (with its extension
called “Solstice”) is “an operating system for governance that aid can plug into and out of
without disrupting the government’s management strategy. In the case of creating strong
government systems, sustainable means the work can continue without the influence of the
aid industry. It is the operating system for sustainably managed governance.”64
Q2. To what extent has the project created or strengthened activities, platforms, mechanisms, or
competencies/capacities that will support the long-term development and system-strengthening of the
education sector?
80. In addition to its primary responsibilities of supporting the coordination and monitoring of the
implementation of the Contingency Plan, the CTIP has also been entrusted (by ministerial
decree) with the responsibility of coordinating the Governing Council of the Ministry of
Education.65 This vote of confidence in the structure of the CTIP is an opportunity for the
creation of the Education Sector Plan Coordination Committee with CTIP members, planned

to be part of the monitoring and evaluation mechanisms of the Education Sector Plan.66
However, clear evidence as to if and how the CTIP will fulfill this role was not available.
81. Several interviewees confirmed, the partial implementation of approaches to distance learning
and accelerated learning has enabled MEN its partners to understand the need to put in place
a robust distance education system, which may include digital technology.
82. According to UNICEF staff, the issue of SRGBV has been placed firmly on the agenda of MEN
and its partners, including a collaboration with the police, as a result of the Project. However,
data to triangulate this claim was not available.
Q3. To what extent was local capacity supported and developed by the project?
83. The Project engaged with the Teacher Study Groups (Comissões de Estudos, COMES) the
School Management Committees (Comité de Gestão Escolar, COGES), and the parents’
associations (Associação de pais e encarregados de educação de alunos, APEEA), all of which
are regulated under MEN norms and standards. As these mechanisms will continue to exist,
the collaboration with them contributed to the sustainability of the project (even though the
evaluation was unable to ascertain the extent to which capacity was built in each of these).
84. With regards to the COGES, the Project provided training directly on the use of the fixed
handwashing devices in 20 schools. Moreover, members of the COGES participated in the
training on SRGBV. COGES benefitted also indirectly, through training to school directors as
focal points on SRGBV and school hygiene, which the school directors passed on to the COGES.
The evaluation confirmed that the COGES actually benefitted in this way in the visited schools.
85. All 182 COMES groups received three sessions of training on the essential curriculum content
for accelerated learning (under Output 5). These training sessions were mandated by the CTIP
to the Regional Technical Committee for the Implementation of the Contingency Plan (CTRIP),
which organized the COMES sessions through the inspector coordinator.
86. Generally speaking, the overall capacity of COMES remains limited. For example, the DRE in
Oio and Bafatá admitted that the participation in the COMES was weak in 2021, and that only
recently a daily subsistence allowance for the participation had been implemented, which
successfully stimulated participation. Teachers in the focus groups noted that they would
particularly like to receive more guidance on planning and preparation of teaching activities
through their COMES.
87. Despite the interventions of the project, the interviewed school directors affirmed that they
did not have increased capacity to handle a future emergency in an improved way. In
particular, all the directors confirmed that there were no plans or ideas on how to guarantee
the continuation of teaching and learning in the event of school closure, with many teachers
likely to leave for Bissau (as happened during the COVID-19 pandemic).
88. The skills of twelve CSOs and NGOs were strengthened as part of the support they provided to
the cash transfer programme. These CSOs worked specifically on the process of targeting
households, collecting data for the base line, the end line and satisfaction surveys, support in
the registration and distribution of SIM cards and mobile phones, and support for the

52
organization of payment sessions.67 Moreover, the Project trained 162 community volunteers
to support parents to supervise their children’s homework. As a follow-up on the Project, these
volunteers are being trained to support radiophonic lessons with groups of student listeners,
using pen drives. The collaboration with and training of CSOs and community volunteers
strengthened the system’s ability to link schools and communities.68

8.6. Equity, Gender and Human Rights
Q1. To what extent have the most vulnerable boys and girls from the most disadvantaged areas of the
covered municipalities benefited from the programme in the country?
Q2. To what extent does the programme provide the same teaching and learning opportunities for
girls and boys?
Q3. To what extent has the programme addressed the gender-specific barriers that prevent girls and
boys from accessing the activities and services available to them?
Q4. In general, to what extent have specific gender, human rights, and equity considerations been
taken into account in the design, planning, implementation, and monitoring of the programme (for
example, in relation to the participation of mothers and fathers, female and male teachers, etc.)?
Q1. To what extent have the most vulnerable boys and girls from the most disadvantaged areas of the
covered municipalities benefited from the programme in the country?
89. The priority geographical areas selected for the Project included (i) the regions and areas most
affected by the spread of COVID-19, namely Bissau, Biombo and Cacheu; and (ii) the regions
with the highest number of children out of school, namely Gabu, Bafatá, Oio and Cacheu. The
evaluation finds this selection suitable, in light of the Project objectives (for example, in the
main objective: “… especially for the most vulnerable affected by the outbreak”). With regards
to equity, the second criterion (number of out-of-school children) was particularly adequate.
This was confirmed by focus groups with teachers and members of the community, who noted
the difficulties of enrolling children in school and keeping them there.
90. The cash transfer intervention targeted households with children who live at least 10 km away
from school. Given that international evidence shows that distance to school is one of the
reasons for non-attendance and dropping out,69 the evaluation found that this was an
adequate targeting criterion to motivate at-risk children to remain in school.
69 For example: Sabates, Ricardo, Kwame Akyeampong, Jo Westbrook and Frances Hunt: “School Dropout:
Patterns, Causes, Changes and Policies.” 2010.
54
91. With regards to the selection of beneficiaries for the cash transfer, the Project considered only
households with children who are in school. Therefore, households with out-of-school children
(who should be considered particularly vulnerable with regards to their overall wellbeing)
were not eligible for participation in this social protection initiative. On the one hand, this
could be considered as a missed opportunity for bringing out-of-school children (possibly back)
into the system. On the other hand, the baseline survey shows that the degree of vulnerability
of the participating households was similarly high, so that this choice was justifiable, given the
budget constraints for this particular initiative.70
92. Fixed handwashing devices were only installed in 20 schools that were already connected to
the canalisation, while TV and radio lessons were produced, which could not be followed in
many regions outside the capital region. While both of these strategic choices were
understandable for reasons of efficiency, they may have exacerbated existing inequalities,
because the most vulnerable children were excluded from the respective benefits.
Q2. To what extent does the programme provide the same teaching and learning opportunities for girls
and boys?
93. The evaluation found that the Project was designed in a way to provide girls and boys the same
teaching and learning opportunities. In effect, the gender differential in the pattern of
enrolment and dropout remained largely unchanged between schoolyears 2018/19 and
2020/21 in the regions of Bafatá and Oio, where these data were available (see Figures 6 and
7). This means that the pre-existing gap in enrolment in favour of boys, which is particularly
high in Oio, continues to persist. Neither girls nor boys in the focus groups gave any indication
of discrimination based on gender at their school.

Q3. To what extent has the programme addressed the gender-specific barriers that prevent girls and
boys from accessing the activities and services available to them?
94. The Project provided resources and training on SRGBV in schools under Output 4. In particular,
a training manual on the prevention of and response to SRGBV was developed, and the
capacity of teachers and school inspectors built accordingly. In this way, the Project addressed
an important set of barriers to girls’ and boys’ school attendance, which had already been
included in the CPD (particularly child marriage, violence, and abuse),71 and which had already
been identified as an important area of concern by MEN and the LEG prior to the Project.
However, neither girls nor boys in the focus groups provided any indication of information on
SRGBV through the Project, nor of any experience of SRGBV.
95. The baseline study of the cash transfer initiative included questions related to early marriage
and the school attendance of girls and boys. Based on the findings, the report highlights the
need for “awareness-raising packages and dialogue with parents and community leaders about
existing opportunities for girls' schooling.”72
Q4. In general, to what extent have specific gender, human rights, and equity considerations been taken
into account in the design, planning, implementation, and monitoring of the programme (for example,
in relation to the participation of mothers and fathers, female and male teachers, etc.)?
96. Education is a right of all children, according to Article 28 of the Convention on the Rights of
the Child (CRC). The main objective the Project was to guarantee this right during the COVID-
19 pandemic, in a context that is characterized by a lack of financial and human resources, and
where many children are out of school. The Project supported MEN to re-open schools in
October 2020 and keep them open, thereby strengthening the realisation of children's right to
education.

56
97. One of the aspects that demonstrates that the right to education is still somewhat
compromised in schools in Guinea-Bissau is the fact that many students are much older than
the age of the level they attend. For example, the boys and girls in the focus group from grades
5 and 6 were between 12 and 17 years old (instead of 11 to 13). International evidence shows
that being older particularly diminishes the opportunities for girls to complete elementary
school before they reach puberty, when issues of marriage and pregnancy can compete with
schooling.73 The Project addressed this aspect by including entry at the age of 6 as one of the
messages in the back-to-school campaign. Children in the focus groups confirmed that they
had heard of this message, but stated that it had not made a difference, as they had all
intended to return to school, in any case.
98. The CRC also stipulates (Article 24) that children are entitled to drinking water, nutritious food,
a clean and safe environment and information to help them stay healthy. The WASH activities
of the initiative (Outputs 2 and 4) were a very important contribution to the realization of this
right.
99. With regard to nutritious food, the initiative did not take advantage of a potential collaboration
with WFP (as did happen within the scope of the CFS initiative) or CRS. Conversely, the Project
contributed to the improvement of the health and physical well-being of students by providing
deworming in schools.

9. Final conclusions
It should be noted that the Guinea-Bissau COVID-19 Education Sector Response project was a “hybrid”
project, with both emergency and development aspects. As such, the Project fits with current reforms
inspired by the World Humanitarian Summit, which focus on the ongoing quest to find “new ways of
working” that bridge humanitarian action, development, peace, and security in a “nexus” approach,
amidst protracted global displacement.74 This hybrid nature in a context of fragility, which was further
exacerbated by the pandemic, posed significant challenges, which the Project had to confront.
With this in mind, the following conclusions can be drawn regarding the relevance, coherence,
effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability, as well as gender, equity and human rights:
Relevance
The Project was well aligned with the Contingency Plan for the education sector, supporting its main
objectives and contributing to all four specific objectives of the Contingency Plan. Furthermore, the
Project’s Theory of Change (ToC) was indeed logical and mostly aligned with implementation realities,
as all the elements of the ToC were translated into planned project outputs, the majority of which
were also implemented. However, a few aspects of the ToC were not fully aligned with implementation
realities, namely distance learning, recovery classes, and accelerated learning. Given the multitude of
supply- and demand-side factors hampering education in Guinea-Bissau, the multi-sectoral approach
taken by the Project was highly relevant to tackle these multi-dimensional barriers.
Coherence
The Project were fully aligned with government priorities and national policies, in particular the
national Education Sector Plan 2017-2025 and the Government’s National Contingency Plan, as well as
the UNICEF Country Programme Document 2016-2020 and the UNCT’s Socio-economic Response Plan.
The Project accelerated other reforms previously discussed by MEN and partners, particularly in
relation to the development of a national strategy for distance learning to benefit out-of-school
children and the implementation of catch-up programmes to minimize the loss of learning.
Effectiveness
The main objective and half of the specific objectives were nearly fully reached. Three specific
objectives were partially reached. In particular, accelerated learning was not fully implemented, while
the effectiveness of distance learning was doubtful, given the restricted access and lack of circular
learning. Best practice and innovation were addressed only through a brief mid-term evaluation and
the present final evaluation. Factors that promoted the effectiveness of the Project were the
demonstration of MEN’ commitment (with UNICEF support) to assist schools to remain open, the
alignment with the Contingency Plan, the multi-sectoral nature of interventions, and the use of the
mWater database. Factors that hindered the effectiveness of the Project were the late recruitment of
a full-time project manager, the low absorption and implementation capacity of MEN, leadership
74 Mendenhall, 2019.
58
turnover in MEN, the lack of water at school level, transportation problems, and the non-availability
of previously planned partnerships to conduct a learning assessment. Regarding unexpected
outcomes, the Project facilitated a trusted list of schools for MEN and its partners, fostered the
accountability of governance in the education sector, and promoted awareness of the importance of
WASH in schools.
Efficiency
Considering the challenges to implementation (including low absorption capacity, frequent leadership
changes, and customs clearance problems, among others), the timeliness of the Project’s
implementation can be considered satisfactory. The largest shares of the budget went to Output 2
(Sanitization of schools) and Output 4 (Multi-sectoral services), which is justifiable, given the close
linkage between Output 2 and the overall objective of continuing education, and the complexity of a
multi-sectoral approach. Due to the high costs involved with water infrastructure, fixed handwashing
devices were only installed in 20 schools that already had access to water. This was efficient, even
though it may have exacerbated existing inequalities. Furthermore, the efficiency of the Project was
facilitated by the installation of the CTIP for coordination and monitoring, synergies with existing
initiatives within UNICEF, and the use of mWater as a low-cost tool for the collection, storage, and
analysis of cross-sectoral data.
Sustainability
The project built logistical capacity for operating in an emergency situation, as well as overall capacity
on education in emergencies. The main coordinating body established by the Project, the CTIP, has
recently been entrusted with the responsibility of coordinating the Governing Council of the Ministry
of Education and may function as the Education Sector Plan Coordination Committee in the future.
Moreover, the agenda in favour of SRGBV, distance learning, and accelerated learning has been
advanced as a result of the Project. The sustainability of the Project was further enhanced by directly
and indirectly engaging with the Teacher Study Groups (Comissões de Estudos, COMES), the School
Management Committees (Comité de Gestão Escolar, COGES), and the parents’ associations
(Associação de pais e encarregados de educação de alunos, APEEA), all of which are regulated under
MEN norms and standards. However, doubts remain regarding local capacity to deal with future
emergencies.
Equity, gender, and human rights
The Project applied equity considerations in the selection of geographical regions and in the targeting
and implementation of the cash transfer initiative. Conversely, efficiency gains may have come at the
expense of equity, with regards to the exclusion of households of out-of-school children for the cash
transfer, and the installation of fixed handwashing devices in schools that already disposed of access
to water. The Project addressed an important set of barriers to girls’ and boys’ school attendance,
which had been previously identified as a concern by MEN and its partners, by tackling SRGBV.
Generally speaking, the Project promoted the right to education (CRC Art. 28), and the right to health
and a safe environment (CRC Art. 24).
10. Lessons learned
This section focuses on the lessons learned from the implementation of the Project, based on the
evidence gathered in the evaluation process, and aims to leverage the experience gained from the
59
Project to identify clues to improving the relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efficiency and
sustainability for similar future projects in Guinea-Bissau or elsewhere.

Lesson learned
paragraphs
LL1. It is possible to reach the majority of schools in Guinea Bissau with support
during an emergency, with sufficient funding. The Project delivered supplies and
provided training to a large number of stakeholders from 1,500 schools in a short
28, 30
period of time, so that schools could be re-opened quickly. In this way, the Project
has built confidence in MEN and at the local level to be able to deal with emergency
situations, with donor support.
LL2. Tackling multiple barriers to education through a multi-sectoral intervention
is an appropriate and feasible approach. The Project involved various sections
within UNICEF (Education, Child Protection, WASH, and Nutrition), as well as the
respective Government counterparts to address long-standing barriers to education. 5
While it was not possible to assess the impact of all the activities, the Project clearly
demonstrated that such a multi-sectoral approach is both appropriate and feasible
in the context of Guinea-Bissau.
LL3. A complex multi-sectoral project requires a dedicated project manager. While
the rate of implementation was initially low, it picked up significantly after a project
54
manager, who inter-acted between UNICEF Sections, took office six months after the
beginning of the Project.
LL4. The mWater database proved to be a useful tool for data collection and
monitoring in education. Among other aspects, the use of mWater facilitated the
establishment of a trusted list of schools, and helped monitor supplies delivered
29, 52, 60
through the Project and school infrastructure. In its cross sectoral approach in
support to the education sector, mWater can contribute to strengthening sectoral
data and overall monitoring capacities.
LL5. Unconditional cash transfers are a relevant social protection initiative in
Guinea-Bissau, but baseline and endline studies for such an initiative should always
be carried out within the same school year. The evaluation found clear evidence
that the cash transfer initiative was an effective social protection tool, which raised
37, 48, 53, 77
the likelihood that families stay out of poverty and keep children in school. However,
the exact impact of the cash transfer with regards to school attendance was difficult
to determine, given that the baseline and endline studies were carried out in
different school years.
LL6. Accelerated learning and distance learning are complex initiatives, which 4, 20, 31-33, 68
require time to test, develop and assess new tools . While the evaluation confirmed
60
the relevance of accelerated learning for children who have missed out on schooling,
as well as distance learning, which can provide alternative pathways for learning
during emergencies or teacher strikes, the Project showed that they are difficult to
develop and roll-out in a limited period of time. Therefore, it is important to ensure
enough time to pilot and assess, for example, the impact of new tools for learning.
LL7. Schools need access to water. The intervention demonstrated that it is difficult
to implement improvements to hygiene in schools without access to water. Apart
from the constraints to securing safe schools, the lack of access to water also led to
70, 92
the unequal decision to install fixed handwashing devices in schools that were
already privileged by access to water. Therefore, the Project highlighted the
necessity to invest in this important aspect of school infrastructure.

1. Evaluation Context and Background
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a
public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) under the International Health Regulations
(IHR 2005) and on March 11, 2020, a pandemic.
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted learning for over 89% of the world’s student population. For
more than 1.5 billion children in 188 countries, education has been interrupted. The gains in expanding
access to education and improving the quality of education were in risk in being permanently
compromised.
In Guinea-Bissau, the first cases of COVID-19 were recorded on 24 March 2020. Two years later, the
country has recorded 8,186 positive cases, including 171 deaths. The capital Bissau and the regions of
Biombo and Bafata remain the most affected. The most affected age group is 25-34 years old, followed
by 35-44 years old and, the disease seems to affect men more than women.
When the first cases of COVID-19 were detected in Guinea-Bissau (in March 2020), all educational
institutions (from pre-school to higher education) closed, reducing the learning time of students
already affected by long and frequent teacher strikes.
COVID-19 has indeed exacerbated a deep learning crisis. In Guinea-Bissau, 1 in 4 children of primary
school age (6-14 years) were out of school before the advent of COVID-19. When they are in school,
the level of achievement in school content is generally very low. The MICS data showed that only 1 in
10 children aged 7- 14 had mastery of basic literacy and numeracy skills.
In Guinea-Bissau, the education system faces many challenges: the system lacks inclusive and safe
school infrastructures, qualified human resources (a good proportion of the teaching staff have
no/limited background in pedagogy) and didactic and pedagogical resources. In recent years, teachers'
strikes have occurred more frequently and for longer durations, increasing the number of out-of-
school children and the risk of permanent drop-out.
For children, the lack of access to education can have lifelong impacts, creating a widening gap in
learning and reducing their ability to acquire skills that increase their employability. The World Bank
estimates that there will be a loss of income of US$10 trillion for the current cohort of children if this
learning crisis is not addressed.
To address these challenges in Guinea-Bissau, it was important to act on several levels and find
educational alternatives that allow out-of-school children to acquire foundational skills for their
personal and social development. With funding from the Global Partnership for Education, UNICEF
Guinea-Bissau has therefore supported the scaling up of the education sector response to mitigate the
impacts of the crisis on access and learning.
2. Evaluation Object
In this context, also marked by the fragility of institutions and the weakness of capacity, Guinea-Bissau
has received an emergency funding from the Global Partnership for Education for a total amount of
USD 3,5 million. Initially design to run for 18 months (from July 2020 to December 2021), the
63
implementation cycle of the interventions covered by this funding has been extended by an additional
6 months (until June 2022).
The main objective of the Guinea-Bissau Covid-19 Education Sector Response project was to support
the government of Guinea-Bissau and the Local Education Group (LEG) to reduce the impact of the
coronavirus on the education of children in the country by ensuring safe school operations and the
supporting continuity of learning, with a focus on the most vulnerable children affected by the
pandemic.
This included the following specific objectives:
- Support response coordination and real-time monitoring (focusing on the most vulnerable);
- Ensure safe school operations including through hygiene supplies and risk communication;
- Support continuity of learning through access to remote learning programs as appropriate for
Guinea Bissau;
- Scale-up psychosocial, health, WASH, and nutrition services within the Education sector;
- Ensure a safe opening-back of schools through back-to-school campaigns, catch-up classes,
and accelerated learning
- Codify and disseminate best practice and innovation. The theory of change underlying the
project was the following:
IF (i) the response to the COVID-19 pandemic at the level of the education system is improved and
national emergency response capacities are strengthened; and
IF (ii) public and community structures for pre-school and basic education are sanitized, inclusive and
gender sensitive; and
IF (iii) distance education strategies and educational alternatives are developed and implemented to
ensure the continuity of education in the event of school closure; and
IF (iv) services of water and sanitation, protection, psychosocial support, health, nutrition, and social
inclusion are extended to the benefit of children from 1400 vulnerable households; and
IF (v) public and community school structures reopen, and propose recovery classes and accelerated
learning;
THEN safe school operations, continuity of learning and well-being for children and adolescents,
especially for the most vulnerable, will be guaranteed.
The key stakeholders of the project and their contributions are listed below:
Global Partnership for Education
- The Global Partnership for Education contributed just under $3.5 million dollars in funding for
the project
Ministry of Education
- The Ministry of Education was responsible for developing high-level policy and for ensuring
the coordination of the project amongst different stakeholders. The Ministry led these coordination
efforts through the Technical Project Implementation Committee (or CTIP in Portuguese), which met
frequently to coordinate project implementation
64
UNICEF
- UNICEF was the implementing agency for the Guinea-Bissau Covid-19 Education Sector
Response project. It was responsible for managing and disbursing the project funds and liaising with
the Ministry of Education to coordinate the implementation. In addition to the education section, the
WASH, Child Protection, and Social Protection sections also provided technical support and
implemented components of the project.
Local Education Group
- The Local Education Group (LEG) is a coordination mechanism led by the Ministry of Education
that ensures mutual accountability for the implementation of the Education Sector Plan and the
supervision of funds implemented with GPE funding. The group includes include representation from
all stakeholders including local civil society organizations (CSOs), non-governmental organisations
(NGOs), donors, and multilateral agencies.
Implementing Partners
- UNICEF worked with several NGOs and CSOs to implement components of the project. These
implementing partners worked to deliver results in narrow areas where they have specific expertise,
such as community mobilization and sensitization.
- In addition, UNICEF entered in a partnership with the Foundation Calouste Gulbenkian and the
University of Minho to support Ministry of Education to accelerate the development of alternative
education curriculum and a distance learning strategy.
3. Evaluation Purpose
This evaluation has two purposes: accountability and learning.
This evaluation will provide both the donor (vertical accountability) and the expected beneficiaries
(horizontal accountability) with solid evidence onto the extent to which the Guinea-Bissau Covid-19
Education Sector Response attained its envisaged objectives.
With respect to learning, this summative evaluation, through the evidence-based knowledge
generated, is expected to inform the design and ex the design and execution of new initiatives within
the new CP. The Ministry of Education, UNICEF, LEG partners, and the GPE will use the evidence-based
findings of the project evaluation to inform and improve the design, implementation, monitoring, and
assessment of future development and humanitarian programming in the education sector.
4. Objectives
The objectives of this summative evaluation are as follows:
1. To determine the relevance, coherence, effectiveness, and efficiency of the Guinea-Bissau
Covid-19 Education Sector Response project.
2. To identify lessons learning regarding what worked and did not work during the
implementation of the project, including unexpected outcomes (positive and negative);
3. To critically analyse the theory of change and the extent to which its planned logical framework
and assumptions compare with the actual implementation and the results achieved;
65
4. To assess the extent to which the project integrated equity, human rights, and gender
principles into its design, implementation, and monitoring;
5. To formulate key recommendations regarding: (1) how to further strengthen the response to
the COVID-19 pandemic in Guinea-Bissau; (2) how to prepare for future education in emergency (EiE)
situations and make the education sector more resilient; and (3) how to better implement future EiE
interventions.
5. Evaluation Scope
Thematic Scope
The summative evaluation of the Guinea-Bissau Covid-19 Education Sector Response project should
examine all the intervention areas included in the project. This includes not only all the activities
directly related to schools and learning, but also to the cross-sectoral interventions supported by the
project (for example, cash transfers, nutrition, WASH, and child protection). The focus should be on
the extent to which the package of interventions was a coherent, relevant, efficient, and effective
response that increased access to quality learning during the COVID-19 pandemic (with a particular
focus on the most vulnerable).
Geographic Scope
The project is national in scope; therefore, the evaluation should include national level secondary data.
The document review should include information covering all regions.
The fieldwork should include data collection in a sample of regions. In the proposal prospective
consultants should propose a sample of regions where they would undertake data collection. UNICEF
suggests that data collection be as diverse as possible, including both urban and rural contexts and
regions with the poorest education indicators. Based on the MICS-6 data, it is suggested that at least
one of the regions of Bafatá or Gabu should be included in the sample.
Chronologic Scope
The proposed evaluation should examine all the activities implemented from the launch of the project
in July 2020 until the close of the project on June 30, 2022
6. Evaluation Criteria and Questions
This evaluation will be guided by five OECD evaluation criteria: (A) relevance; (B) coherence; (C)
effectiveness;
(D) efficiency; and (E) sustainability, as well as (F) an additional Gender, Equity and Human Rights
criterion. It should be noted that the evaluation criterion of impact was not included because given
the short duration and emergency focus of the project the impact will be difficult to measure and
assess.
To achieve the purpose of the evaluation, the Evaluation Team will seek to answer the following
evaluation questions:

communities?
The above questions are questions suggested by the Guinea Bissau Country Office. However, the
independent evaluation teams may adjust the questions in the technical proposal and, if hired for this
mandate, finalize them in collaboration with UNICEF staff and possibly other evaluation stakeholders.
7. Evaluation Methodology
The evaluation will be conducted using a participatory and inclusive approach to provide relevant and
pertinent answers to the evaluation questions. The technical proposal will need to make a specific
reference to the specific evaluation approach to adopt as well as to the theoretical framework
underpinning the selected approach.
With regards to the Convention on the Rights of the Child1, the evaluation team is expected to propose
adequate engagement of children and adolescents throughout the evaluation process (to this end, the
use of “body mapping”, the “H Framework” and the “Air balloon” methodologies are strongly
recommended).
The evaluation will be based on mixed methods of collecting and analysing data obtained from the
boy/girls/caregivers who are expected to benefit from the programme being evaluated.
The purpose of using multiple methods is to triangulate data from different sources to formulate the
findings and to provide the most relevant and credible answers to the evaluation questions. To
enhance the rigour of the evaluation, during the inception phase, the evaluation team will develop
rubrics for each one of the indicators included in the evaluation matrix and each question will need to
be addressed at least through 3 different methods (and not simply three different sources pertaining
to only one method).
The evaluation will employ both quantitative and qualitative (i.e., mixed) research methods during
both the data collection and analysis phases. Relevant data should be collected from the UNICEF
education programme, the Guinea-Bissau Ministry of Education, other implementing partners, project
beneficiaries and other key stakeholders. Primary data collection will involve qualitative and
quantitative data and could include (but is not limited to) the following methods:
- A desk review of all documents related to the design, implementation, and monitoring of the
Guinea- Bissau Covid-19 Education Sector Response project, as well as the education sector response
to the COVID-19 pandemic more generally
69
- Qualitative Methods
o Key informant interviews;
o Focus Group Discussions;
o Structured and semi-structured interviews;
o Classroom observations;
o Visits to schools and inspections of WASH facilities;
o Review of learning and communication materials produced by the project (TV broadcasts,
COVID-19 risk communication)
- A quantitative analysis of existing data, such as mWater (the databased used to identify and
monitor schools supported by the project), the cash transfers database, etc.
- A process of dialogue with key actors concerned by the programme, including:
o UNICEF Staff (Education, Nutrition, WASH) at the Country Office level
o Staff of Ministries involved in the project
o NGOs and Civil Society directly involved in the implementation and service delivery related to
the project
This multi-stakeholder dialogue will also serve as an opportunity to review, and amend, if necessary,
the theory of change of the project in question.
A detailed design of the evaluation including the proposed methodology for each evaluation question
and/or objectives, sample size, sampling methodology and the tools to be used will be proposed by
the consultant/s in his/her/their bid. It is expected that the methods and sampling proposed for
assessing the effectiveness and achieved results of interventions are sufficiently robust to ensure the
credibility and internal validity of the evaluation results. The final methodology will be agreed to during
the inception phase and approved by the evaluation reference group. The consultants are strongly
encouraged to propose the use of innovative methodologies in their technical proposal.
Existing data and documents will be made available to the evaluation team by UNICEF staff at least
one week before the start of the consultation. The consultant/s will submit an inception report with a
detailed methodology, which will include both, quantitative and qualitative elements, designed to
accurately answer the evaluation questions. In order to demonstrate that the evaluation team has
clearly understood the content of the project as well as the fundamental questions to be addressed by
this evaluation, the inception report will provide a critical summary of the information contained in
the programmatic documents made available to the evaluation team by UNICEF after signing the
contract.
The inception report will also indicate for each of the evaluation questions the following information:
what methods and data collection tools will be used to respond to it, from whom the data in question
will be collected (including the respondent sampling strategy), which analytical methods will be used
to interpret the data, what measures will be adopted to ensure the quality of the evaluation, and how
the data will be disseminated.
70
This report should also propose specific measures that will ensure that the evaluation complies with
ethical standards including the confidentiality and respect for dignity of those involved.
The evaluation will be conducted according to the evaluation norms and standards of the United
Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG)2 and the UNEG Code of Conduct3. Specific reference should be
made to the Ethical Research Involving Children4, as relevant.
Transversal analysis of human rights, gender and equity aspects shall be conducted in line with the
Guidelines on the Integration of Human Rights and Gender Equality in Evaluations5. Close attention
shall be paid to the conformity of different deliverables of this mandate with the GEROS standards6,
as UNICEF will not accept deliverables that do not comply with these standards or aforementioned
UNEG guidelines. The GEROS standards, that will be also used to determine the rating of the final
report by a UNICEF-independent entity, will be shared by UNICEF with the evaluation team
immediately after the signature of the contract.
In order to increase its use, the main conclusions and recommendations of the evaluation will be
disseminated in the form of briefing notes or policy briefs. The evaluation validation workshop will
serve as an opportunity to develop, in a participatory manner, the action plan for the implementation
of the main recommendations of the evaluation or "management response".
8. The Work Plan (Key deliverables, Tasks, Timeframe and Payment Schedule)
The individual consultant will be hired for a period of 60 business days between August 2022 and
October 2022. The consultancy will consist of three main phases as described below ( see Table 2) .
UNICEF Guinea Bissau will provide the necessary administrative and logistical support as needed for
the consultant/s to undertake the activities (Visa Assistance; Transportation arrangement, Internet
access in UNICEF Office provided). The consultant/s will be under the technical supervision of the
Education Chief (direct supervisor). The project has planned for three weeks of in-country data
collection and field work. The activities before and after the field work will be home-based.
Key Deliverables
The consultant(s) / evaluation team will provide the following products in Portuguese electronically.
In addition, the inception report, draft evaluation report, final evaluation report, evaluation synthesis
and final PowerPoint should be translated into English or French. (further details and deadlines will be
specified during the inception meeting):
1. Inception Report, including a detailed description of the methodology, data collection tools,
and suggested work plan. The report (max. 30 pages + appendices) will be structured as follows:
• Introduction presenting the object of the evaluation, its purpose, scope, and objectives
• Preliminary results of the documentary review summarized in the evaluation context section
• Evaluation criteria and questions refined through the desk review and preliminary interviews

and the UNEG Guide on the Integration of Gender Equality and Human Rights in Evaluation. This report
will be the subject of several iterations (series of exchanges) between the evaluation team and UNICEF
to ensure the respect of these standards. Each finding, conclusion and recommendation should be
numbered and the links between them should be clearly stated in the conclusions and
recommendations sections.
3. Power Point presentation summarizing key preliminary findings and conclusions (to be held
before the international consultant leaves the country)
4. Evaluation presentation and recommendation validation workshop (to be facilitated remotely
or by national consultant, as agreed with UNICEF). The Team Leader will produce and deliver
PowerPoint presentations of the main evaluation findings, conclusions, and recommendations; the
presentations will be shared with the ERG members.

9. Ethical Principles in Evaluation
The evaluation should be conducted according to the ethical principles and standards defined by the
United Nations Evaluation Group:
72
• Anonymity and confidentiality: The evaluation must respect the rights of the people who
provide information, guaranteeing their anonymity and confidentiality.
• Responsibility: The entire team must confirm the results presented in the report, any
disagreements are to be mentioned. The report should inform about any conflicts or differences of
opinion that may have arisen between the consultants or between the consultant and the programme
managers regarding the conclusions and / or recommendations of the evaluation.
• Integrity: The evaluator will need to highlight issues that are not specifically mentioned in the
ToR, in order to carry out a complete analysis of the programme.
• Independence: The consultant must ensure that he/she remains independent in respect to the
programme under review, and he/she should not be involved in its implementation or any other phase.
• Incidents: If problems arise during fieldwork, or at any other point of the evaluation, they
should be reported immediately to the Evaluation Manager. If this is not done, the existence of such
problems can in no way be used to justify the failure to achieve the results expected by UNICEF in these
terms of reference.
• Validation of information: The consultant/s must ensure the accuracy of the information
gathered during the preparation of the reports and will be responsible for the information presented
in the final report.
• Intellectual property: Using the different sources of information, the consultant/s must respect
the intellectual property rights of the institutions and communities involved in the evaluation.
• Submission of reports: If the reports are submitted after agreed deadlines, or if the quality of
the submitted reports is significantly lower than agreed, the sanctions provided in these terms of
reference will apply.

A4.2. Guide for focus group discussions
Duration: 45-90 min.
Overall Objective
To promote a discussion based on the participants' sharing of views and ideas to
allow for an examination of the different perspectives at play and how they were
constructed, as well as their stability/irreducibility.
Role of the facilitator (evaluator)
The facilitator of the discussion should promote interaction and confrontation of
different points of view to bring out the perceptions and views of the participants
on the topics below. The facilitator's role during focus group discussions should be
to spark discussion and broaden the range of responses. Participants should be
encouraged to approach the issues from new and unexpected points of view.
It should be kept in mind that promoting confrontation of views and opinions
should never put the participants in question, either from an institutional or
personal point of view.
Participants
The group should consist of between 6 and 10 participants. Participants must
decide whether they want to take part in the evaluation, and they may withdraw
at any time.
Procedures
The objectives of the evaluation should be presented at the beginning of the
meeting.
It is structured by discussion topics. It should include all comments considered
relevant for a better interpretation of the participants' interventions, particularly
behavioral signals. Attention is drawn to the care to be taken to avoid subjective
80
and abusive interpretations of the participant's words.
All sentences that due to their potential uniqueness or because they reveal a very
personal approach of the participant should, whenever possible, be reproduced in
the terms used by the participant.
