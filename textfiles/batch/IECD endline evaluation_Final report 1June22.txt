to conduct this endline survey and final programme evaluation during April – December 2021,
with the great support and insightful inputs from UNICEF Viet Nam.
We are thankful to the representatives from MOLISA, MOH, MOET, World Vision, Child Fund,
Save the Children, and other relevant stakeholders in project provinces, districts, and
communes for finding time to meet with the evaluators and sharing your reflections on the
programme.
The research team is grateful to the Project Management Units of the Integrated Early
Childhood Development in 3 project provinces and 27 communes for their strong support
during the field work. In particular, thanks are due to Mr. Luong Van Kien (PMU Dien Bien),
Mr. Nguyen Dinh Bac (PMU Kon Tum), and Ms. Nguyen Thi Tuyet Nga (PMU Gia Lai), for their
active collaboration. We would also like to extend our gratitude to the IECD program focal
points whose coordination and facilitation really smooth the process of data collection – Ms.
Tran Thi Hoa, Mr. Chu Quyet Tien, Mr. Van Tien Thu, and Mr Phan Van Hoi.
We appreciate the participation of every beneficiary household and service provider in our
endline survey.
Last but not least, the creation of this report would not have been made possible without the
contribution of 16 enthusiastic enumerators whose professional experience has helped to
ensure that our collected data is truthful and always of the highest quality.
The research team specially thank UNICEF members including the key focal points (Mr.
Nguyen Dinh Quang, Mr. Nguyen Minh Nhat, Ms. Nguyen Thi Y Duyen) for connecting us with
the provincial partners, and UNICEF Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Chief – Ms. Ngo Thi
Quynh Hoa as well as other experts at the technical team for providing important guidance and
comments on the draft report. We also thank Mr. Oscar Huertas – UNICEF evaluation
specialist for his constructive feedback and editing.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
In the absence of a strong mechanism for inter-sectoral and multi-sectoral coordination of Early
Childhood Development (ECD) services, UNICEF implemented the Integrated Early Childhood
Development programme (IECD) to strengthen the enabling legal and policy environment for
IECD at national level, in cooperation with the Ministry of Labour, War Invalids and Social
Affairs, and in 27 selected communes of 9 districts in three projected provinces namely Dien
Bien, Kon Tum, and Gia Lai. The pilot model which ran from 2017 to 2021 will generate further
evidence and policy options for a nationwide IECD scale-up in the next phase.
The IECD programme aims to simultaneously achieve (i) UNICEF’s country programme IECD
outcome, (ii) IECD-linked long term and immediate objectives cooperation projects between
UNICEF and the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA) and with the Ministry
of Health (MOH), and (iii) UNICEF’s provincial projects’ long-term and immediate objectives
on IECD. The outcome and objectives help to realise UNICEF East Asia and Pacific’s
commitment to the SDGs in full alignment with its 2018-2021 Strategic Plan goals.
Purposes and Audiences of Endline Survey and
Evaluation
Since the programme is set to complete its pilot cycle in the three provinces, an endline survey
and evaluation are needed to draw out lessons learnt for the nationwide scale-up.
The end-line survey and evaluation report are subjected to achieve the following objectives:
• To conduct a survey capturing the status of the IECD programme indicators in a
quantitative manner which will also capture effects of Covid-19 in project provinces
• To evaluate the programme effectiveness, efficiency, scalability and sustainability
• To provide the lessons learnt and recommendations for the central and local
governments, as well as UNICEF in replication and scale-up of the model at a national
scale
The intended audience of the endline survey and evaluation include:
• The Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA), especially the
Department of Child Affairs
• UNICEF Management and the Programme Team
• Provincial People’ Committees (PPCs) of three project provinces and PPCs of other
provinces/cities in Viet Nam
The brief timeframe of the endline survey and evaluation is as below:

Methodology of Endline Survey and Evaluation
The Endline Survey and Evaluation employs mixed methods, including qualitative and
quantitative methods, to collect data for calculating endline value of the interested programme
indicators. Desk review focuses on two major components: IECD programme design &
implementation status and impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on programme implementation.
The review explores the existence of a certain number of IECD supportive policies and
coordination/ integration between sectors to assess the current situation of ECD in Viet Nam
and help form qualitative inquiry areas which focus on assessing the programme effectiveness,
efficiency, scalability and sustainability.
The quantitative surveys were conducted with three groups of respondents, including
households, commune official staffs and local ECD service providers, including commune
health centres and preschools. Due to the fact that COVID-19 pandemic affected one project
district namely K’Bang in Gia Lai province, the survey area shrinks from 27 communes to 24
communes. Endline survey was, therefore, conducted in 24 communes of 8 districts in 3
projected provinces with total of 960 households, 24 commune staffs and 51 ECD service
providers. To make the endline statistics comparable with baseline statistics, the research
team reran the baseline statistics to cover only 24 communes. Quantitative analysis is
performed using STATA.
For the qualitative method, the team conducted in-depth interviews (KIIs) with representatives
of Project Management Unit (PMU) at provincial – district – commune levels and local ECD
service providers in the project locations. The research team also organized focus group
discussions (FGDs) with four groups of parents/primary caregivers (two male groups and two
female groups) who had children aged 0-8 in Dien Bien and Kon Tum. For each province, the
research team randomly selected one district and one commune to conduct qualitative study.
Totally, 27 KIIs and 12 FGDs were conducted. Qualitative analysis is done using Grounded
Theory and a four-step analytical strategy derived from Thematic Content Analysis.
Programme Evaluation
Effectiveness
Key evaluation questions:
• Has the programme achieved the targets and results set out in the programme design
at the outset?
• What is the governance structure of the programme and how effective this structure
was for service delivering, coordination, and collaboration?
Replying to the above questions, the programme’s effectiveness is rated as ‘Satisfactory’ for
the following reasons:
• In six areas of focus, namely Child health, Education, Child protection, Peace building
and social cohesion, Access to and use of IECD services and Implementation of IECD
programme, the programme achieves an improvement in almost all indicators, except
2
for the decline in the percentage of local health workers able to perform IYCF
counselling (from 65.7 per cent to 48.7 per cent). The decrease is attributed to the
reduced training rate, which comes from the fact that not every health worker in the
center received IYCF training; and in the year 2021, under the COVID-19’s pandemic
impact, no IYCF training has been conducted.
• More than 95 per cent of service providers in project areas rate the IECD programme
as quite useful and very useful.
• Strong coordination mechanisms and monitoring systems exist in the project locations.
At the central level, the IECD programme has created a clear working structure and
well-shaped coordination mechanism. Compared with the baseline, the linkages
between stakeholders are strong in the sense that the central government provides
technical support to the local government and the local government, in return, reviews
and provides the central government with evidence of the interventions’ effectiveness.
• Vulnerable and marginalized children benefit from the IECD programme in different
ways. For example, in Dien Bien province, 9 models managing disadvantaged children
are established in project communes.
However, even though there has been improvement in some indicators’ performance, the
improvement will need further investment and support is to continue to reach the target. For
example, the percentage of people in humanitarian situations who access safe drinking water
increases from 30.1 per cent to 49.4 per cent, but the target rate for the whole programme
area is 100 per cent. Also, the programme’s implementation are hindered by climate change,
natural disasters in the sense that the devastating flood in 2019 affected a wide area covering
Gia Lai and Kon Tum province and put people’s lives in jeopardy. Also, language barriers make
it hard for parents/ caregivers to comprehend the training content and gender stereotypes
discourage fathers from participating in the training and club meetings
Efficiency
• How economically resources or inputs (such as budget, expertise and time) are
converted to results?
• Did the programme manage to achieve all or some of its objectives within established
timeframes and costs?
• Did the programme demonstrate some flexibility in adapting to any change in
environment in terms of political, legal or socio-economic aspects?
The efficiency of the IECD programme is rated as “Moderately Satisfactory” for the following
reasons:
• Most participants in the qualitative study agreed that project implementation is as cost
effective as originally proposed. First, the cost sharing policy between the donor
(UNICEF) and the recipients (project provinces) is considered relevant and effective in
ensuring compliance and delivery of operations. Second, the budget was fairly
distributed between components and between localities. Third, despite funding
constraints, financial resources were utilized as efficiently as possible, resulting in the
achievement of most important objectives.
• All three provinces achieve a high disbursement rate, at higher than 90 per cent, which
implies that almost all project activities are delivered and associated expenses are
disbursed according to the plan.
3
• Regarding the objective achievement, three provinces manage to achieve
improvement in at least two thirds of the quantitative indicators within the established
timeframes and costs.
• The programme demonstrates certain level of flexibility to adapt to environmental
changes such as Covid-19 pandemic. As an example, UNICEF invested in digital
equipment for PMU and provincial partners to conduct online meetings/training during
the period when social distancing was tightened.
However, key issues affecting the assessment of efficiency include:
• The financial resource is not sufficient to achieve all objectives set in the originally
planned vision, which is more ambitious. This leads to modifications of some activities
and adds complexity to the implementation process.
• The received funding opportunity is not equal across programme components. While
some components such as early essential newborn care or holistic parenting have
good funding, other components are in need of more fund.
• Resource mobilization was not as successful as expected so there is not much of a
flexibility in adjusting the programme to adapt to socio-economic trends and emerging
needs of people. For example, despite attempts to take a high-tech approach in
reaching the most vulnerable children in remote areas, UNICEF could not deploy the
mobile technology tracking system called Mobile Integrated Early Childhood
Development (MIECD)1 in 27 project communes due the substantial amount of
additional budget required.
Sustainability
• Are there prospects for further development of related interventions after the end of the
programme cycle, even across project locations?
• Are local governments in project locations committed and simultaneously capable of
maintaining the IECD operationalization model by the end of the programme cycle?
• Do capacity building activities within the IECD programme positively affect
sustainability and have they been systematized and institutionalized?
The sustainability of the IECD programme is rated as “Satisfactory” for the following reasons:
• Given that the programme was deliberately built upon local needs and capacities,
several core elements inherited from the IECD programme have been systemized and
institutionalized for continuous implementation. First, child protection interventions
hosted by DOLISA (the Nobody’s Perfect” model, developed child protection systems,
case management for marginalized children, …) have been formalized into national
and provincial action plans to be maintained regardless of UNICEF’s support. Second,
impacts of the education sector (the Social Emotional Learning (SEL) curriculum, GGA
and ECDS tools) are very likely to persist as having been nationally adapted by MOET.
Last, with regards to the health sector, some key activities that belong to the fixed roles
and responsibilities of the service providers will continue to be carried out, including
1 MIECD is an artificial intelligence-driven analytic system that provides complete decision support for
appropriate and timely actions at critical points of care to save mothers and children’s lives through data
warehousing, predicting, data mining and advanced analysis
4
height and weight measuring (for children below 5), vitamin A and vermifuge
distributing, postpartum mother visiting, early stimulation counseling. Multiple
micronutrients for young children, multiple micronutrients for pregnant women,
detection, and treatment of children with severe acute malnutrition are put into the
nutrition benefit package that has officially been formulated at MOH and advocated to
be covered by government insurance.
• The cross-level and cross-sectoral coordination mechanisms are considered a
distinguished element of the IECD programme and have been constantly reinforced
throughout the implementing period. UNICEF has helped facilitating smooth vertical
cooperation between provincial, district, communal and village stakeholders
specifically in terms of establishing action plans in alignment with targeted objectives;
carrying out capacity building for service providers; monitoring and documenting
achieved results through field visits, periodic meetings, and progress reports. The multi-
sectoral collaboration in each level of subnational government is also maximized,
reflected by the representation of different technical fields (health, education, child
protection, ...) in both IECD management boards and in IECD activities (training,
communication sessions, ...). While the IECD steering committees at provincial, district,
and commune levels may disband at the end of the programme, the established
communication system and network, which in this case is closely-connected and well-
functioning, will continue to be utilized for further activities.
• There exists a genuine willingness and a continuing commitment of beneficiaries, local
governments and service providers to sustain IECD models in the coming phases. At
the local government level, project provinces and UNICEF have discussed together to
find a way moving forward with the IECD models in the coming phases. In fact,
additional children-related indicators are successfully integrated into the provincial
annual and 5-year social and economic development plans to demonstrate the
provinces’ ownership to sustain invesment on children.
• Capacity-building for teaching staff has been proven to be impactful, which further
highlights the potential sustainability of ECE interventions.
However, there are also several factors seriously affecting the programme’s sustainability that
needed to be well taken into considerations:
• Child nutrition related objectives are presenting major difficulties for sustainability since
the programme is targeting the most vulnerable population groups with poorest
socioeconomic conditions.
• A stable financing mechanism to cover treatment costs for severely acute malnutrition
can become an intolerable burden for project provinces in the absence of UNICEF’s
funding source.
• IYCF capacity building training at endline are less accessible for healthcare workers
than before.
• The Covid-19 is putting a substantial amount of burden on medical staff at all levels,
leaving them no time for other roles and priorities.
Scalability
The scalability of the IECD programme is rated as “Satisfactory” for the following reasons:
5
• Beneficiaries and provinces show their willingness to continue participating in
programme activities, but more attention would be put on resource allocation for Covid-
19 prevention.
• 100 per cent of service providers involved in the survey claim that they would
recommend the IECD model to be implemented in other communes/localities.
• Enabling actors at national and provincial level all express their enthusiasm by mapping
out detailed plans for model upscaling in the next phase, but there is rising concern
about the shortage in both current financial and human resources.
• PMU at all levels have high confidence in the applicability of the IECD model in non-
program areas, but some modification in the design and approach methods should be
made for each locality.
• Abundant evidence for replicability in non-program districts exists within three
provinces.
• Covid-19 pandemic is anticipated to affect the implementation of the programme’s
activities only, not the long-term objectives and planning.
Recommendations
There are some proposed recommendations for sustaining the achieved results of the IECD
programme as well as facilitating smooth replication of the models in non-program areas, for
example:
For UNICEF:
• Work with the three provinces to identify successful lessons and discuss ways to turn plans
to maintain and replicate programme’s outcomes into concrete actions;
• Organize multistakeholder conferences to use the programme evaluation results to inform
policy and suggest future adjustments from what works and what does not work in the pilot
model;
• Continue to invest in capacity building activities for relevant stakeholders when possible,
especially in the area of health and nutrition;
• Technology can be further leveraged in order to generate more widespread impacts. It has
been proven that smartphones and social media are very popular information channels
even in mountainous provinces thanks to high Internet/mobile phone coverage in Vietnam.
Therefore, it would be strategic to make good use of technology in order to eliminate
geographical barriers to people living in remote and isolated areas;
• The design of any future programme should take into accounts cross-cutting issues like
climate change, economic shocks, and gender equality. In order to establish highly
practical and not overly ambitious objectives, it is important to carefully consider financial
factors and pay greater efforts in doing costing for each intervention package.
For the central government:
• Continue to foster coordination between sectors and across levels in order to optimize
resources and highlight the role of a holistic approach in IECD;
• Prioritize the needs of the underprivileged in disadvantaged areas in order to reduce
regional disparity, thereby realizing development goals in a more focused manner. Support
for vulnerable population can be more intensive and diverse in methods. Resources may
6
not be distributed equally in a mechanical way but should be allocated based on the
assessment of people’s socioeconomic backgrounds and status;
• Simplify administrative procedures and cut down on cumbersome regulations required
during programme implementation to reduce unnecessary burdens created by
bureaucracy and paperwork;
• Work closely with UNICEF to provide technical guidance to 63 provinces during
implementation of Decision 1437/QD-TTg regarding early childhood development scheme.
For province partners
• Continue to develop concrete action plan to sustain achieved results as well as to replicate
IECD models in non-program areas;
• Maintain and nourish the enabling environment for IECD at provincial, district, commune
and grass-roots level;
• Promote the exchange of knowledge and experience between intervened and non-
intervened communes;
• Interact with the central government and relevant stakeholders for IECD-related policy
feedback;
• Mobilize financial resources from diverse sources to allocate adequate funds for committed
plans;
• Encourage and support the use of ethnic languages in all communication materials
targeting the ethnic minorities who have limited cross-cultural interactive opportunities.

INTRODUCTION
1.1. Country context
Early childhood, from conception to the first eight years, is the period when the brain develops
most rapidly and most dependently on both enriching and adverse environments. Early years
of childhood form the basis of intelligence, personality, social behaviour, and capacity to learn
and nurture oneself as an adult. Many children do not reach their full human potential because
of their 'families' income status, geographic location, ethnicity, disability, religion, or sexual
orientation. They do not receive adequate nutrition, care, and opportunities to learn.
Despite significant improvements in a range of health and social indicators in Vietnam in recent
years, children, particularly children within 0-8 age range remain exposed to multiple
deprivations in health, nutrition, education and protection. Moreover, inequities persist in
Vietnam between girls and boys, rural and urban and different ethnic groups.
The newly endorsed Law on Children 2016 introduces a number of improvements as
compared to the Law on Protection, Care and Education of Children, 2004. Holistic childhood
development is articulated in key chapters on specific child rights and state duties. However,
holistic early childhood development and rights to early childhood development are not
adequately stipulated with legally binding duties and measures for enforcement. The Ministry
of Labour, Invalids, and Social Affairs is responsible for coordinating sectoral policies and
programmes among concerned ministries and agencies on childhood care and development,
which implicitly includes holistic early childhood development. However, there is no coherent,
comprehensive Early Childhood Development policy nor an effective coordination
mechanism2.
Recent economic progress has improved the well-being of millions of Vietnamese children, but
not all have benefited equally from such prosperity. There is equity in access to preschool by
gender and ethnicity, but it does not necessarily translate into improved learning outcomes for
all children. While there are vertical interventions in health, nutrition, reproductive health, and
education, little has been done to horizontally integrate services for early childhood
development, especially for children from 0 to 3 years old, and particularly at the household
level. Even within ministries, there is fragmentation between agencies with low incentives for
integration. While the life cycle is an integral part of the social protection system in Viet Nam,
the youngest population – especially under '3' – do not benefit from the schemes except for
the health insurance. Existing parenting materials, especially for children from 0 to 3, mostly
focus on health and nutrition, disregarding child development. Despite the observed increase
in the rate of exclusive breastfeeding, it has yet become a practice and boys are more likely to
be exclusively breastfed than girls3. Progress has been slowest in reducing malnutrition

(stunting), which partly reflects the fact that maternal nutrition remains a problem not
addressed adequately in the National Nutrition Strategy. The rates are highest in the Central
Highlands and other disadvantaged regions where ethnic minority people live (the Central
Coastal region and the Northwest).
Analysis of the Early Child Development Index (ECDI), which is used to determine if children
are developmentally on track in four domains: literacy and numeracy, physical, socio-
emotional, and learning show disparities. 29.4 percent of children were on track in the literacy-
numeracy domain, more in the physical (96.5 %), learning (94.2 %), and social-emotional (91.2
%) domains. However, in each individual domain the higher score was associated with children
living in the richest households, with children attending an early childhood education
programme and older children4.
It is well recognized that there are severe short-term and long-term effects of violence against
children. Most immediately, consequences include physical injury, delayed physical growth,
damage to the brain, and cognitive and language deficits, with such consequences often being
interrelated. In the short term, there are significant impacts on a child’s development and
adjustment as well as relationships with parents, other adults, and peers – problems such as
aggression, withdrawal, isolation, and even self-harm. Unfortunately, in Viet Nam, violence-
discipline is widely practiced by parents, with more than seven in every ten children aged 1–
14 were found to have experienced physical or psychological punishment at home
1.2. The IECD Programme
UNICEF globally calls for greater integration and synergy across sectors to support integrated
programming for children at different stages of the life cycle. The current UNICEF Strategic
Plan recognizes specifically the critical importance of the early years on the basis of the latest
evidence on the science of brain development: "New scientific research on brain development
has brought fresh evidence of the critical importance of early childhood development for future
learning achievements, health outcomes and productivity, and the cumulative nature of
deficits". An integrated approach to early childhood development (IECD) is not only a global
but a national priority in Viet Nam as set forth in the Law on Children 2016. IECD will help the
country to achieve a high quality of human capital from the early years of human life, a pre-
requisite for sustainable development.
During the programme cycle 2017-2021, with a total budget of 10,584,000 USD the IECD
programme was implemented at the national level (to improve the policy framework for IECD)
and in 27 selected communes of 9 districts of three projected provinces, namely Dien Bien,
Gia Lai and Kon Tum. Of which, Dien Bien is a mountainous province in the Northwest region
while Gia Lai and Kon Tum are located in Central Highlands of Vietnam. All three provinces
are characterized by a high degree of ethnic diversity and persistent rate of multi-dimensional
poverty, evidenced by the high stunting rate and limited access to quality healthcare, nutrition
and sanitation services.
The IECD programme aims to simultaneously achieve:

The outcome and objectives helped to realise UNICEF East Asia and Pacific’s commitment to
the SDGs in full alignment with its 2018-2021 Strategic Plan goals. To be specific, the IECD
programme contributed to the realization of one of three Regional Headlines for UNICEF East
Asia and Pacific, namely “Early Moments Matter” which puts a strong focus on brain
development for young children as a way to build up human capital – the greatest assets of
nations.

1.3. Implementation status of the IECD pilot
programme in three project countries
According to the mid-term review, the IECD programme has maintained a very good and
sustained momentum at both national and subnational levels in the development and
institutionalization of an integrated version of ECD. In details, the achieved outcomes are
presented below:
• Contribute to the implementation of the National Socio-Economic Development
Strategy 2011-2020 and Socio-Economic Development Plan 2016-2020;
• Address the existing gaps and disparities in realizing the rights of all children,
strengthen the evidence for policy-making and demonstrate the effectiveness of an
integrated and holistic cross-sectoral approach;
• Encourage and enhance shared responsibility among parents/caregivers, families, and
social service providers;
• Address multiple disparities in health, nutrition, WASH, education, social protection and
child protection to ensure equal access to quality IECD services for vulnerable children
• Address the unfinished agenda of MDGs and SDGs;
• Maximize IECD outcomes and ensure every child in 3 project provinces is healthy,
ready to learn and thrive.
At national level, the programme has supported the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social
Affairs (MOLISA) to draft the national scheme for ECD which was later approved by the Central
Government under Decision no. 1437/QD-TTg. This creates enabling environment with strong
political commitment to scale up the programme nationwide through the ministerial budget. To
date, 58 out of 63 provinces have developed their own approved provincial ECD action plans
for implementation of the Prime Minister’s approved national IECD scheme document.
At subnational level, a multi-sectoral governance mechanism has been established at
provincial, district, commune and village level in order to initiate and facilitate the
implementation of project activities as well as holistic ECD services. Comprehensive ECD
services/interventions are being delivered coherently through the four main platforms (i) the
commune health centres, ii) local preschools, iii) community-based IECD clubs, and iv)
individual households). Of these, communal IECD clubs are functioning as the main
powerhouse of sectoral collaboration in services delivery. Of the 38,000 children and families
(including vulnerable children) targeted to utilize IECD services for the entire duration of the
project, 53,543 parents /child care givers and children have been reached by 2020. The
development of a Viet Nam-contextualized Social Emotional Learning (SEL) Programme has
been piloted in 174 preschools in the three UNICEF focus provinces, benefitting 9,398
preschool children (51% boys and 49% girls). The NPP Rapid Assessment also shed light on
the effectiveness of the holistic parenting programme, which helped change parent and
caregiver’s practices. Facilitators of the programme (mostly Kinh) claimed to have greater
cultural understanding of ethnic minorities thanks to active listening and sharing of parenting
experiences. Furthermore, capacity-building interventions contributed to an improvement in
the delivery of ECD services by frontline staff.
These achievements explain the fact that the IECD programme has been on course to
successfully achieve its programme targets. Despite that, the programme is also facing certain
1
challenges during its implementation, including high rate of absenteeism due to language
barrier and scheduling conflicts, insufficiently skilled facilitators and limited budget.
2020 – 2021 provincial work plan
In terms of the key outcomes expected to achieve at the end of 2020 and at the end of 2021
in three project provinces (Dien Bien, Kon Tum and Gia Lai), the 2020 – 2021 work plan will
continue to:
• Provide services and equipment with the application of mobile technology, digital
technology, indicators to track and evaluate the implementation process;
• Create favourable environment and conditions to deploy the interventions of the IECD
in districts and communes;
• Harness the use of evidence from research and documentation of lesson learnt to
inform policy advocacy and strengthen sectoral management.
Experiences and lessons from the IECD model in the three provinces will be used for
replication of good practices for achievement of equity of ICED access, benefiting all
disadvantaged children in Vietnam.
The national scale up of the IECD programme (approved by the Prime Minister) is projected
to happen between 2021 and 2025. The specific objectives of the scheme for the 2021-2025
period had already been mentioned in the previous section.
1.4. The endline survey and evaluation
Objectives of the end-line survey and evaluation
A baseline survey was conducted and completed in October 2018 to establish a set of values
for all indicators at the starting point of the programme. Now that the programme is set to
complete its pilot cycle in the three provinces, a final evaluation of the results is needed to
draw out lessons learnt for the nationwide scale-up.
The end-line survey and evaluation are subject to achieve the following objectives:
• To conduct a survey capturing the status of the IECD programme indicators in a
quantitative manner which will also capture effects of Covid-19 in project provinces
• To evaluate the programme effectiveness, efficiency, scalability and sustainability
• To provide the lessons learnt and recommendations for the central and local
governments in replication and scale-up of the model at a national scale
Scope of work
The survey and the evaluation focus on national level at the three project provinces of Dien
Bien, Gia Lai and Kon Tum. The survey and evaluation will look into how the programme has
performed on its all indicators and if the programme is effective, efficient and sustainable/
scalable with its current design and governance.
The thematic areas include integrated holistic parenting, services on health, nutrition, WASH,
education and governance systems of the programme.

1.5. Structure of the report
The report begins with objectives of the IECD programme and an overview of IECD enabling
environment in Viet Nam, provided in Chapter One and Chapter Two. Chapter Three outlines
the methodology and provides details of necessary approaches in the fieldwork inclusive of
endline survey and the qualitative research design. Chapter Four presents key results of the
quantitative and qualitative endline evaluation. Four criteria in programme evaluation namely
Effectiveness, Efficiency, Sustainability, and Scalability are expanded upon in Chapter Five.
Chapter Six discusses some cross-cutting issues related to human rights such as ethical
considerations in research and gender mainstreaming. Limitations of the endline survey and
evaluation are briefly mentioned in Chapter Seven before the last chapter about Conclusion
and Recommendation. Other relevant documents can be found in the Appendix.

METHODOLOGY
2.1. Overall description of approach
To collect data, a mixed-method approach, including desk review, quantitative and qualitative
method is applied in this endline survey and evaluation. In addition, a participatory approach
is also employed, by engaging all relevant stakeholders and beneficiaries in the process of
identifying key findings, conclusions and recommendations. In specific, the quantitative
method involves the use of Household Survey, Commune Survey and ECD Service Provider
Survey; and the qualitative method comprises of Key Informant Interview and Focus Group
Discussion.

2.2. Desk review
Desk review focuses on two major components: IECD programme policy, institutional socio-
economic environment, design & implementation status and impacts of COVID-19 pandemic
on programme implementation. The review explores the existence of certain number of IECD
supportive policies and coordination/ integration between sectors to assess the current
situation of ECD in Viet Nam and help form qualitative inquiry areas which focus on assessing
the programme effectiveness, efficiency, scalability and sustainability.
The research team consult with and obtain necessary documents from UNICEF Viet Nam and
key stakeholders e.g., other UN staff, key national and sub-national government agencies, and
other relevant partners such as civil society organizations/ NGOs.
2.3. Quantitative Method
Quantitative surveys gather information from households, local service providers and
communities where IECD services are available. Impacts of Covid-19 outbreak on the
programme outcomes in project provinces are also quantified, to possible extent. Same as
baseline survey, the quantitative surveys include the following questionnaires to gather
sufficient indicators of interest:
• A household survey with those having children age 0-8;
• A local service provider survey with pre-schools/nurseries, ECD centres, commune
healthcare centres;
• A commune survey to gather information at commune level of ODF certification, m-
IECD module covered communes, availability of IECD services.

Household Survey
It is essential to re-survey the intervention group, so the research team propose to conduct the
household survey with the same size and as many repeated households as possible (1,080
households in 27 communes). In case children in any of the 1,080 households grow out of 0-
8 age range or move out of the community, such households are no longer qualified for the
survey and replaced with a new household that has children aged 0-8 living in the same village.
Step 1: Preparing the list of official and reserve households
The list of baseline-surveyed households serves as the official list. The research team obtained
the reserve list of households living in the same village and having children aged 0-8 from
database of Department of Child Affairs, Ministry of Labour, War Invalids and Social Affairs.
Step 2: Selecting the households for interview
Baseline-surveyed households are considered qualified for this endline survey if they have
children aged 0-8 at the time of the survey. The research team invited as many as possible the
qualified baseline-surveyed households to interview (official households). We randomly
selected other eligible households from the reverse list in case of impossible interviewing any
repeated households. Similar to the baseline survey, the total number of surveyed households
in each village (or enumeration area-EA) is 20 (or 40 for each project commune) and the total
sample size is 1,080 households in 27 communes.
Service Provider Survey
The research team re-surveyed the service providers (preschools and commune health
centres) that participated in the baseline assessment.
Commune Survey
The commune questionnaire was filled up by one respondent who is knowledgeable of the
project at the commune level as identified from the qualitative study. All communes in the
programme were surveyed, except for the three communes in K’Bang district (Gia Lai province)
which were affected by Covid-19 pandemic and removed from the survey.
7
Survey Design
The household questionnaire captures the after-intervention status of the household’s socio-
economic characteristics; profile of children aged 0 to 8 broken down into 5 sub-groups with
different indicators measured for each targeted group6; KAP questions regarding IECD
services, parenting practices; etc. The service provider questionnaire (separately designed for
pre-schools and health care centres) collects information regarding availability of ECD services
at endline period, capacity/facilities of service provider and its personnel, etc. The commune
questionnaire covers information that cannot be collected at household level such as ODF
certification, m-IECD modules, WASH services, etc.
In general, the endline questionnaires inherit most of the contents from the baseline survey
tools with an aim to generate reasonable comparisons between the two periods. However,
MDRI also added some questions specifically designed for the endline assessment (Covid-19
related questions, programme evaluation). Furthermore, in close consultation with UNICEF
technical experts, the research team made several other changes in the questionnaires to
describe the interventions more precisely.
From October 27, 2021 to November 15, 2021, the quantitative survey took place in 3 project
provinces, in which MDRI enumerators successfully interviewed 960 eligible households and
obtained responses from the representatives/leaders of 24 communes, 27 preschools/
nurseries and 24 health centres. The number of completed surveys is less than the initial
proposal in Figure 3, due to the fact that COVID-19 pandemic affected one project district
namely K’Bang in Gia Lai province. As a consequence, the survey area reduced from 27
communes to 24 communes.

2.4. Qualitative Method
To assess the programme effectiveness, efficiency, scalability and sustainability, the
qualitative study seeks answers to the following questions:
Effectiveness:
• Has the Programme achieved the targets and results set out in the programme design
at the outset?
• What is the governance structure of the programme and how effective this structure
was for service delivering, coordination, and collaboration?
Efficiency:
6 0 – 6 months; 6 - 23 months; 24 – 35 months; 36 – 59 months; 5-8 years. Three first groups then can
be aggregated to analyze for the group of the first 1000 days.
8
• Did the programme manage to achieve all or some of its objectives within established
timeframes and costs?
Scalability and sustainability:
• Are there prospects for further development of related interventions after the end of the
programme cycle, even across project locations? If not, then why?
• Are local governments in project locations committed and simultaneously capable of
maintaining the IECD operationalization model by the end of the programme cycle?
To answer the above questions, two qualitative methods were used to collect information: Key
Informant Interview (KII) and Focus Group Discussion (FGD). At national level, the research
team interview key informants from Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA),
Ministry of Health (MOH) and Ministry of Education and Training (MOET). In each of three
project provinces, we interviewed 01 Provincial PMU Leader, 01 Officer from Department of
Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs, 01 Commune PMU Leader, 01 Commune Child Protection
Officer, 01 Pre-school Principal and 01 Head of Commune Health Centre; and conducted 01
FDG with Provincial PMU members, 01 FGD with representatives of IECD Operation Board at
district level, 01 FDG with male parents/caregivers and 01 FGD with female
parents/caregivers. The total of KIIs and FGDs is summarized in the table below:

2.5. Data analysis
Quantitative analysis was performed using STATA. In addition to its well-known capability of
analysing data, STATA did a great job by offering a package (igrowup_stata) to determine the
stunting rate among children under 5 (in Indicator 1). To be specific, with built-in reference data
for height measurement from population, the package calculates z-score for the height for age
anthropometric indicator. Children whose height-for-age is more than two standard deviations
below the median of the reference population are considered short for their age and are
classified as moderately or severely stunted. The package was developed by WHO and can
be found via this link: https://www.who.int/childgrowth/software/en/.
Descriptive statistics are used to present the data and findings are presented in tables attached
with the dataset, in comparison with baseline values. Given that the survey area in the endline
was reduced from 27 communes to 24 communes, the research team re-run the baseline
statistics for the reduced area to be comparable with endline statistics. Furthermore, due to
several revisions made in some endline questions that were not totally consistent with
baseline, computation formula in such cases was also adjusted accordingly to generate better
proxy. Therefore, comparisons between baseline and endline statistics for indicators with
changes should be made with caution.
Figures and analyses are presented in the Chapter 4 of the report, which also addresses and
to some extent accounts for the differences between disaggregated groups based on location,
gender of the household head/ primary caregiver, household wealth quintile, educational level
of the household head/ primary caregiver, etc. Following MICS 6 reporting guidelines,
indicators with a small number of observations are displayed using the following rules:
• For indicators with fewer than 25 observations: the number of observations will be
displayed in the table, but the percentages should not be calculated or discussed. If a
percentage is based on fewer than 25 unweighted cases for any category of an
indicator, the category should be kept and ‘(*)’ should be put in place of the
percentages;
• For indicators with between 25 and 49 observations, the percentages should be shown
in parentheses in the table and interpretations will be limited.
10
Given that the surveys were implemented in 24 project communes where in each commune,
only 1-2 preschools and 1 health centre were surveyed, the issue of small number of
observations is commonly faced. And percentages, if calculated in indicators at the commune
level and relevant comparisons, need to be analysed with great caution.
Qualitative analysis was done using Grounded Theory and a four-step analytical strategy
derived from Thematic Content Analysis. First, all data collected from KIIs and FGDs were
transcribed, organized according to pre-determined questions. Second, the data was
subjected to an open-coding process without prior assumption of any theoretical frameworks.
Key themes were then distilled and extracted. Third, the research team investigated themes
identified and made necessary adjustments to refine them, e.g. ‘difficulties of the PMU at the
commune levels”, “reporting frequency of the PMU” and “family level barriers to ECD
participation”. Last, data were kept and stored by theme, from which direct quotation was used
in writing the report.
2.6. Evaluation risks and limitations
Despite the thorough preparation, there existed some limitations to the assessment. The
research team were aware of potential risks and limitations to derail an evaluation and made
efforts to anticipate and account for external dangers.

LITERATURE REVIEW
3.1. Legal and policy context
Vietnam context and legal environment
The Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam in 2013 declares that children are
protected, cared and educated by the State, family and society, having the right to be involved
in issues of children. Vietnam was the first country in Asia and the second in the world to ratify
the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) in 1990. Vietnam is also committed to
achieving the UN Global Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as well as Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, which requires constant efforts and assiduous attention
to children development. The Law on Children (2016) is a noteworthy effort of the Vietnamese
government in creating a solid legal foundation to safeguard child rights and improve the
provision of comprehensive children development in all terms of physical, intellectual, mental
and ethical aspects. Before that, the Law on Child Protection, Care and Education (2004)
and the Education Law (first issued in 2005) had laid the cornerstone for the construction of
supporting policies in child protection, care and education. Throughout the two-decade period
between 2001 and 2021, three Action Plans for Children at the national level have been
adopted with increasingly ambitious objectives and specific targets regarding child nutrition &
health, child protection, education, and participation of children in child-related issues.

Policy framework
Policies on Early Childhood Development (ECD)
Early childhood in this assessment is understood as the period from conception to the first
eight years of a child. This is the time that formulates personality, social behaviour, intellectual
13
and social capacity of a person because the brain develops most rapidly and most dependently
on enriching/adverse environment during the very first years. For such reasons, early
childhood care and development is considered a vital prerequisite not only for the
comprehensive growth of children but also for the strengthening of human capital in general.
Realizing the significance of early childhood development (ECD), the government of Vietnam
has approved the Scheme for total development of children during early years in family and
community during 2018 – 2025 under Decision no. 1437/QD-TTg dated October 29 2018, with
a special focus on 0-8 year-old children. The scheme desires to achieve the following targets
for the 2021-2025 period:
• 90% of the up-to-8-year-old children have access to services in support of
comprehensive development according to demands and suitable to age-groups for
health care, education, nutrition, nurture care, child protection and social welfares;
• 90% of the cadres involved in child-related activities at medical examination and
treatment establishments, educational institutions, child-nurturing establishments, child
protection service- providing establishments, community-based cadres, parents and
child tenders are provided with relevant knowledge and skills to support and care for
the child comprehensive development;
• 90% of the provinces and centrally run cities build and maintain the networks for
connection and level transfer of child comprehensive development caring services;
monitor and assess demands of up-to-8-year-old children and experiment the model of
child comprehensive development care at families and communities.
The scheme addressed the necessity of a cross-sectoral collaboration and information sharing
between government ministries and UN agencies/non-governmental organizations to foster
integrated ECD services at families and communities and develop a monitor and evaluation
framework for ECD indicators.
Policies on child health and nutrition
Vietnam has made impressive progress towards improving children’s health and nutritional
status in the past few decades, evidenced by the accomplishment of the MDG targets on child
healthcare and maternal health on a national level. In particular, the reduction of child stunting
rate, the under-five & under-one mortality rate as well as maternal mortality rate was
considered satisfactory. This has been done thanks to the endorsement of an array of
supporting policies, many of which happened during the implementation of the IECD
programme. Some of the most important and recent policy updates include:
• The Promulgating Programme for Nutrition Care in the first 1000 days of life for
prevention of maternal and child undernutrition and improvement of Vietnamese
people’s height, under Decision no. 1896/QD-TTg dated 25/12/2019. Given the birth of
this programme, the significant role of the first 1000 days (the period between
conception and children’s 2nd birthday) in building blocks for brain development and
long-term health has been realized and called to greater investments and attention;
• Intervention Programme to reduce mortality rate among the children under five years
old by 2030, under Decision no. 1493/QD-TTg dated 10/09/2021. The programme will
be implemented nationwide, according to the roadmap and in line with the issued
strategies and policies with priority given to difficult mountainous areas and ethnic
minority.
14
Accompanying the new adoption of recent policies, previously issued law and strategies should
also be mentioned:
• For example, health insurance has been made free for children under 6, children from
poor households, children from minor ethnic groups living in difficult socio-economic
regions, children living in extremely difficult socio-economic regions and children living
in island communes and districts, under the Law on Health Insurance (which is
amended from the Law on Health Insurance no. 46/2014/QH13 dated 13/06/2014 and
the decrees and circulars guiding the implementation thereof);
• The Ministry of Health (MOH) also issued regulations on Early Essential Newborn Care
(EENC) for vaginal delivery in 2014 and for C-section in 2016, which should be applied
for all relevant health care facilities across the country;
• The National Nutrition Strategy National Nutrition Strategy for 2011-2020, with a vision
toward 2030, under Decision no. 226/QD-TTg dated 22/02/2012 has also achieved
critical results in improving and balancing diet in both quantity and quality, ensuring
hygiene and reducing child malnutrition, especially child stunting by 2020.
The National Institute of Nutrition with the support of the SUN Civil Society Alliance of Viet
Nam, UN agencies and other partners is currently working on the finalization of the National
Nutrition Strategy for 2021-2030 with a vision toward 2040. This legal document is expected
to support more equitable, resilient and sustainable food and health systems and continue
elevating baby and infant health through proactive promotion of breastfeeding and reduction
of childhood stunting. By the time of writing this report, essential nutrition interventions such
as micronutrient supplementation for young children and pregnant women; detection and
treatment of children with severe acute malnutrition are being incorporated into the nutrition
benefit package by MOH to be covered by the national health insurance system.
Beside nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene are indicators that are closely linked to
education, skills development and stunting. Adequate investment in WASH would optimize
Viet Nam’s competitiveness in the regional and global market and accelerate its achievement
of the SDGs (UNICEF, 2020). In the roadmap towards SDG by 2030, the government of
Vietnam is also taking decisive actions to improve access to safe and equitable drinking water,
sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), with high priority placed on rural areas. Such political will is
reflected by the launching of the National Strategy on Rural Clean Water Supply and Hygiene
till the year 2020, under Decision no. 104/2000/QD-TTg dated 25/8/2000 with an objective that
“All rural people shall have access to national-standard clean water with the minimum volume
of 60 litres/person/day, use hygienic latrines and well practice personal hygiene and protect
environmental hygiene in villages and communes”. To implement the strategy, the government
issued the National Targeted Programme (NTP) of Water and Sanitation for Rural
Development for 1998-2005, 2006-2010, 2011-2015 and later the NTP of New Rural
Development for 2016-2020. These policies put a strong emphasis on the supply of clean
water and adequate hygienic latrines at educational establishments, hospitals, clinics, offices
and markets; controlled environmental hygiene in villages and communes through
concentrated husbandry and livestock; as well as the protection of underground and surface
water.
Policies on Early Childhood Education (ECE)
15
ECE in this report refers to education services for children up to 6 years of age (pre-primary
education). By this mean, ECE includes 3 main categories – crèches (3 months old - 3 years
old), kindergarten (3 years old – 6 years old), and young sprout schools (a combination of
crèches and kindergarten).
According to the Education Law, the overall objective of pre-primary education is “to help
children develop physically, emotionally, intellectually and aesthetically, in order to shape the
initial elements of personality and to prepare children for the first grade”. However, the delivery
of ECE services for children under 3 and children aged 3-6 is different in essence, with the
former typically embraces childcare while the latter incorporates the broader concept of both
“care” and “education” to introduce children to a school-type environment for preparatory
education purposes (ILO, 2012).
In Vietnam, preschool levels are not mandatory among children entering primary education.
However, the Ministry of Education and Learning (MOET) is making constant efforts to raise
public awareness of ECE and enhance school readiness for preschool children. Notably, the
revised Education Law 2005 (first issued in 1998) stipulated that pre-primary education for 5-
year-old children shall be made universal.7 Before that, in 2002, the Prime Minister had
approved Decision no. 161/2002/QD-TTg to promote the socialization of education and
diversify ECE services (public/private) (Vu, 2021).
The latest version of the Education Law, which passed on June 2019 and took effect since
July 2020, contains many important modifications relating to ECE:
• ECE officially recognized as the first level of Vietnam’s national education system for
the first time;
• Free preschool tuition for 5-year-old children in villages and communes with
exceptional difficulties, ethnic minority areas, remote and isolated area. Preschool
children at 5 years of age beside those regulated above and students at lower
secondary education level shall be exempted from tuition based on road maps
specified by the Government;
• Preschool teachers must possess at least a pedagogical college diploma (before –
intermediate pedagogical degree). Furthermore, according to Circular no. 26/2018/TT-
BGDDT, preschool teachers since November 2018 must be able to use at least one
foreign language (preferably English or ethnic language for ethnic minority areas).
Between 2018 and 2021, with the technical support from UNICEF, the Vietnamese government
and MOET have also been introducing new legislation to heighten recognition and
commitments towards ECE. To name a few:
• Decision no. 1677/QD-TTg dated 03/12/2018 approved the ECE development project
for the 2018 – 2025 period which promotes child-centered approach and encourages
socialization of ECE services to meet diverse needs of children. This legal document,
according to the representative of MOET, became a fundamental for 63 provinces of
Vietnam to build their own development plans;
7 Universalization of education is a process of organization for every citizen to study and reach a
minimum educational level under the State's regulations (Decree 75/2006/ND-CP)
16
• Decree 105/2020/ND-CP (a replacement of Decree 06/2018/ND-CP) provided funding
support to feed preschool children ($USD 100/month/45 children); allowance for
teachers; equipment, toys and teaching aids for private kindergartens in industrial
zones;
• Other circulars and guides issued by MOET between 2020 and 2021 to enact
competency frameworks and promulgate professional standards for ECE, including but
not limited to: Circular no. 52/2020/TT-BGDĐT regarding preschool regulations,
Circular 49/2021/TT-BGDĐT on organization and operations of independent childcare
centres, kindergartens and preschool classes; among others.
These are remarkable changes that show growing recognition and commitments towards the
advancement of equitable ECE services at the national level.
Policies on children’s rights to protection
Viet Nam has made efforts to harmonize domestic law with the provisions of the Convention
and other international treaties to which Viet Nam is a party implementing the programmes in
relation to children's rights to protection. It is defined as the rights to be protected against all
forms of labour exploitation, sexual exploitation and abuse, drug abuse, neglect and
abandonment, kidnapping and trafficking; be protected from unjustified interference in mail and
privacy; protected against torture, beatings and abuse when violating a law or detained
(UNICEF Vietnam, 2016).
The Law on Children (2016), the Labour Code (2019), the Penal Code (2015), and the Law on
Domestic Violence are among the country’s powerful legal documents that recognize and have
contents related to children’s rights to protection. In addition to these laws, there are also a
number of regulations, decisions and directives introduced to comprehensively intensify
children’s rights to protection, presented in the below table:

Policies related to ethnic minority children and children with disabilities
Aside universal policies for every child across the country, the Vietnamese government does
regulate specific policies targeting highly marginalized and vulnerable groups of children such
as ethnic minority children, children with disabilities, HIV-infected children and children living
in poor households. There were Programme 135 and 30a targeting ethnic minorities to improve
living conditions on some expected outcomes namely poverty, income, agriculture production,
housing conditions, and access to basic public services.
Most recently, the country issued the new National Targeted Programme (NTP) for ethnic
minority which aims to boost socio-economic development in ethnic minority-inhabited and
mountainous areas in the 2021 – 2030 period (first phase rolled out in 2021 – 2025). The
programme is the biggest NTP ever approved by the National Assembly with a total budget of
up to $USD 9 billion for the implementation period of 10 years. It has 10 component projects
encompassing such aspects as health care, education, gender equality, infrastructure,
housing, WASH, cultural values, communications, sustainable agriculture and forestry
production, and so on.
On the other hand, other supporting packages and policies for ethnic minority children and
children with disabilities include:
• To ensure adequate living conditions:
✓ Social assistance policies (monthly social allowances) for beneficiaries of social
protection including orphanage children, abandoned children, HIV-infected children
living in poor households and children with disabilities currently being taken care of
in social work centres, under Decree no. 136/2013/ND-CP (now known as Decree
20/2021/ND-CP);
✓ The scheme on caring helpless orphans, neglected children, HIV/AIDS infected
children, victims of chemical toxic, serious disable children and children that are
affected by natural disasters and community-based disasters in 2013-2020, under
Decision No. 647/QD-TTg.
• To foster education development:
✓ Priority policies in enhancing the participation of students with disabilities and ethnic
minority children in the national schooling system, as prescribed in the Education
Law;
✓ Preserving the learning and teaching of ethnic minority languages in general
education institutions and in continuing education centres, under Decree no.
82/2010/ND-CP;
✓ Education Development Master Plan for children from very-low population ethnic
groups for 2010-2015, under Decision no. 2123/QD-TTg. The beneficiary of the
plan includes preschool children aged 3-5 from 9 minor ethnic groups namely O
Du, Pu Peo, Si La, Ro Mam, Cong, Brau, Bo Y, Mang and Co Lao living in 6
provinces: Lao Cai, Ha Giang, Dien Bien, Lai Chau, Nghe An, Kon Tum;
✓ Priority policies in enrolment and learning support for preschool children, school
and university students from very minor ethnic groups, under Decree No.
57/2017/ND-CP;
18
✓ Additional lunch allowances for preschools in extremely difficult villages,
communes, in coastal areas and islands, under Decree 105/2020 /NĐ-
CP (replacement of Decree 06/2018/ND-CP).
• To foster socioeconomic development:
✓ Socioeconomic Development Master Plan for people from 4 minor ethnic groups,
namely Mang, La Hu, Cong and Co Lao for 2011-2020 (under Decision no.
1672/QD-TTg dated 26/11/2011 approved by the Prime Minister). Specific targets
for reducing the stunting rate among children under five are included.
3.2. Situation analysis of early childhood development
in Vietnam
Despite the existing legal frameworks with many supporting policies on children, the current
situation of children’s lives especially in highly disadvantaged areas still consists of many
daunting challenges due to inequitable ECD service delivery.
Child health and nutrition
Between 2002 and 2019, Vietnam witnessed a nearly 18% decrease in the national stunting
rates of children under 5 (Figure 4).

Success in reducing the child mortality rates can also be observed at a national level through
consistent downward trends over time. By 2019, the national average IMR and U5MR of
Vietnam are 14‰ and 21‰ respectively8, which more than halved the previous decade’s
results.
Despite these achievements, inequalities still exert a huge influence on the life and health of
many children, especially marginalized and vulnerable ones. The gap in the prevalence of
stunting between the Kinh and ethnic minority children is large and appears to be widening.
According to a report from the World Bank, 31.4% of ethnic minority children were stunted in
8 The Population and Housing Census 2019. Retrieved from https://vietnam.un.org/en/28931-results-
population-and-housing-census-0142019
19
2015, which doubled the rate of the Kinh (15%) and also exceeded the national average at
17.5%. The percentage point difference between the two population sub-groups also increased
from 2010 to 2015, indicating that the disparities grew greater over time (Mbuya, Atwood, &
Huynh, 2019). Similar patterns have also been translated to the underweight and wasting
rates. Malnourished children are mainly concentrated in mountainous areas of Vietnam,
including the Northern areas and Central Highlands (Mbuya, Atwood, & Huynh, 2019).
On the other hand, Vietnam is also currently facing the “double burden” of childhood
malnutrition, understood as the coexistence of both over-nutrition (overweight and obesity) in
big cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh city, alongside under-nutrition (stunting and wasting) in
mountainous areas (Harris et al., 2020). More than one in four urban children are overweight
or obese, according to the National Nutrition Survey conducted in 2020, with the average
nationwide prevalence of 19%, more than doubled the figure in in 2010 (8.5%) (National
Institute of Nutrition, 2020)
The variation in mortality rates across subnational units can be as large as fivefold (Burstein
et al., 2019). To be specific, child mortality, despite undergoing a downward trend over time,
still saw high visibility in the Northern regions, followed by the Central Highlands (Figure 5).
The U5MR rate of the rural areas is also twice as high as that of the urban areas, at 25‰ &
12‰. Ethnic minority children are 3.5 times more likely to die before the age of 5 than their
Kinh counterparts9. That does not include the missing data on the number of neonatal and
stillborn deaths, especially in mountainous rural areas largely populated by ethnic minorities
(UNICEF).
Figure 5. Mortality rate per 1000 live births, 2000 (left) & 2017 (right)
Source: Healthdata
When it comes to reproductive health, inadequate and limited access to healthcare services
still cause 46 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, as recorded in 2019 (2019 Population
and Housing Census).

Early education
As displayed by the data from the Ministry of Education and Learning (MOET) in Table 9, the
number of both teachers and children at preschool level has constantly increased over time.
By the school year 2019-2020, Vietnam has 15 thousand preschools (nurseries and
kindergartens combined), accommodating 5 million children aged 0-6.

Notably, the enrolment rate of preschool children also grew considerably over the past two
decades and reached 96% by 2019 (Figure 6), which is 2.3 times higher than the period’s
starting point. This result clearly suggests the effectiveness of the Vietnamese education
universalization programme.

Unlike most low-income countries, Vietnam prioritizes public investment in education with
relatively equal apportion of budget to pre-primary education compared to higher levels. As a
telling example, while Indonesia and Vietnam – both being lower-middle income countries
allocate 20% of its state budget to education, the share of the total budget to pre-primary
education was 2% and 16%, respectively (Zubairi & Rose, 2017). Similarly, it is estimated by
World Bank that 0.62% of Vietnam’s GDP was spent on pre-primary education – higher than
the OECD average of 0.54% (World Bank , 2018).
In recent years, the Vietnamese government, with the technical support from UNICEF, has
been boosting large investment in upgrading preschool teachers’ pedagogical capacity and
integrating social and emotional learning (SEL) into the educational curriculum. To be more
specific, The MOET has successfully endorsed the SEL Programme with the adoption of the
21
Global Guidelines Assessment tool (GGA) and the East Asia Pacific ECD Scales (ECDS) in
the Vietnam context. The GGA toolkit allows education professionals to systematically
examine and improve the quality of their ECE services whereas the ECDS serves as an
evidence-based instrument for government agencies to monitor the impact of their ECE
policies on preschool children and communities in order to better plan for the following period.
The master training on SEL – GGA - ECDS has been conducted for 195 education officials,
school managers and teachers of all 63 provinces for further nation-wide application through
cascade training.
Even though Vietnam is “on track” to improve its pre-primary education policies, many
challenges remain unresolved. The first and foremost one is regional gaps in preschool
education quality including access to learning and availability of materials and teachers in
disadvantaged localities (Kataoka et al., 2020). To be more specific, although the government
distributes higher per-capita education spending for regions with poor socio-economic
conditions, the actual investment results greatly depend on the financial capacity and
commitment of the respective governments at local levels (Kataoka et al., 2020). Furthermore,
the shortage of qualified teachers is another major concern, especially in rural and remote
areas. Teachers in rural regions do not receive proper training and are not frequently
supervised by a government body. The situation is even worse in mountainous areas where
trained teachers/caregivers are seriously lacking (Dinh, 2019). Research findings also unfold
the fact that many teachers are still struggling to adapt to the holistic child-centred educational
philosophy, which could also be a factor affecting ECE development (Phan, 2018). Last but
not least, a large number of children below the age of three are still mainly taken care of at
home, by grandparents or parents. There is a window of opportunity for ECD interventions to
make an impact on an individual’s body and mind during the first three years, yet the proportion
of under-three-year-old children attending nurseries in 2018 was only 28% (Abbott et al.,
2019), which is considered low. Boyd and Dang (2017) attributed this situation to the ineffective
cohesion between teaching programmes for different age groups at pre-primary level.
Children’ rights to protection
Despite improved legal framework in children’s rights to protection, inadequate public
awareness of child discipline and poor practical implementation in communities still prevail.
According to a report published by MOLISA, of 2000 recorded child abuse cases in 2018, 75%
is ranked sexual abuse (MOLISA, 2018). It was also reported by GSO and UNICEF that more
than seven in every ten children aged 1–14 were found to have experienced physical or
psychological punishment at home (GSO & UNICEF, 2020-2021). Boys are 4% more likely to
be a victim of violence discipline, compared to girls. Violent practices are more common among
Khmer ethnicity and people living in the Southeast region. The exercise of corporal punishment
is deeply rooted from the cultural belief “Spare the rod and spoil the child” in which ensuring
children obedience is core to good parenting.
A study found a close correlation between age, educational attainment, socio-economic
conditions and attitude of mothers/primary caregivers versus violent disciplinary practices
(Trang & Nguyen, 2014). To be specific, smaller age, lower educational level, poorer wealth,
and negative attitudes towards partner violence/physical punishment are believed to contribute
to higher likelihood of violent discipline. Women having more children are prone to violent
disciplinary practices (Trang & Nguyen, 2014) yet the total fertility rate (TFR) is higher among
less educated, poor women, which further exacerbates existing disparities.
22
Le, Vu and Maternowska (2018) attributed violent discipline in Vietnam to three major key
drivers: (i) powerful structural factors (poverty, gender inequity, migration, and socio-economic
status), (ii) institutional factors (incomprehensive child protection system, weak school
governance), and (iii) cultural norm.
In short, Vietnam still faces daunting challenges in terms of safeguarding children’s well-being
and family sustainability due to varying socio-economic conditions and weak delivery of social
service (Spence & Nguyen, 2021).
3.3. Demographic context
Vietnam population
The total population of Viet Nam in 2019 reached 96,208,984, in which men accounts for 49.8%
(47,881,061 people). The Viet Nam Population Pyramid 2018, compiled from the Population
and Family Planning Survey of 1/4/2018 shows that the proportion of old age groups is
gradually growing larger, which implies the process of “population aging”. The total
dependency ratio of Vietnam in 2018 was 48.5%, meaning that on every 100 persons in
working age (15 – 64 years old), there are approximately 50 dependent persons (under 15-
year-old children and 65-and-above adults).

change and family planning survey
Vietnam has more than 26.3 million children under 16 years old with the sex ratio being 114
boys per 100 girls (Le T. H., 2020).
Child population by age group and ecological areas
23
The total population of children from birth to eight years old in 2019 was 14,576,466, which is
15% higher than ten years before (in 2009). There is no major difference in the number of
children divided by age, as can be seen in Table 10.

The distribution of children across geographical areas also follows the country’s overall trend.
In particular, among six ecological zones, the Red River Delta and Southeast regions are the
most densely populated regions, with 1,060 persons per km2 and 757 persons per km2,
respectively. On the contrary, The Northern Midlands and Mountain areas and the Central
Highlands regions had the lowest population density, at 132 persons per km2 and 107 persons
per km2, respectively.
The population of children from birth to eight years old comprises of ten different ethnic groups
including the Kinh, Tay, Thai, Muong, Khmer, Hoa, Nung, Mong, Dao, Gia Rai and other ethnic
groups.
Socio-economic context
Viet Nam is concerned with multidimensional aspects of poverty and not just with the lack of
financial resources and access to basic goods. Derived from the multidimensional poverty
framework, Vietnam also developed a well-defined model for multidimensional poverty in
children which is believed to provide a complete and comprehensive depiction of child poverty
in Vietnam. This model comprises of eight basic welfare domains including health, nutrition,
education, housing, clean water/sanitation, child labour, recreation and social inclusion. It
reflects the ecological and synergy of integrated childcare emphasizing the connections
between each aspect. For example, having secured a family income does not guarantee that
the child may have access to health care and education.
The most recent report conducted by GSO and UNICEF in 2020 calculated multidimensional
child poverty (MDCP) using data from the Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey
(VHLSS) 2018. In particular, the deprivation score was estimated from 0 (no deprivation in
indicators) to 1 (deprivation in all indicators). Children are considered multi-dimensionally poor
if their score is higher than the cut-off threshold.

A comparison of a three-year period shows that regardless of the cut-off threshold, the MDCP
rate has been decreasing appreciably from 21% in 2014 to 14% in 2018, meaning that
children’s lives have continued to be improved. However, closer scrutiny into the differences
in MDCP rates across population subgroups signals existing inequalities among children with
different demographic and socio-economic characteristics. As illustrated in the below table,
children with the following background or characteristics are particularly more likely to suffer
from multidimensional poverty:
• Children in the 0-2 age group;
• Living in the Central Highland & Northern Midlands and Mountain regions;
• Residing in rural areas;
• Belonging to ethnic minority groups such as H’Mong, Dao, Tay, and Kho Me;
• Raised in households whose household heads’ education level was low.

Multidimensional poverty affects the lives of Vietnamese children, most severely to those in
disadvantaged rural and distant communities.

KEY FINDINGS
4.1 Socio-economic characteristics of households
and primary caregivers
This part provides an overall picture of socio-economic characteristics of household heads and
primary caregivers involved in the endline survey. The survey was designed to gather basic
information about households (represented by household wealth index) and individual
characteristics (gender, ethnicity and level of education of household heads and primary
caregivers).
To calculate the household asset-based wealth index, the research team applied the principal-
components approach of Filmer and Pritchett (2011)10, similar to the baseline methodology.
The index is computed based on household ownership of different kinds of assets, including:
access to electricity, television, refrigerator, radio, bike/electric bike/electric scooter, motorbike,
car, access to internet, computer/tablet, telephone/mobile phone, livestock/poultry, bank
account/e-wallet, access to improved water, access to improved latrine and a house with solid
floor, solid roof, and solid wall. The final score index is used to classify the household rankings
divided into five quintiles, of which a higher score is equivalent to higher accessibility to the
assets. With regard to asset ownership, 97.4 percent of households participating in the endline
survey reported to have access to electricity. Moreover, a majority of households owned
motorbikes and phones, with the percentage of 91% and 88.4% respectively. Meanwhile, only
around 20 percent of them possessed a refrigerator and bicycle. It seemed that beneficiary
households in the endline survey gained better access to most kinds of assets compared to
the baseline.
10 According to Filmer and Prichett (2001), the principal-components approach is used to determine the
weights for an index of the asset variables. In this approach, an index is constructed as the first principal
component of a vector of assets of households such as durables and housing conditions. Filmer and
Scott (2008) and Kolenikov et al. (2009) conclude that rankings of various measures of welfare, including
outcomes for education, health care, fertility, child mortality, and the labor market, are very similar to the
ranking of asset indices.
The principal component approach defines a weight index in terms of the first principal component of
the variables used. The wealth index, denoted by 𝐴 for household j is computed as follows:
𝑗
𝐴 = ∑ 𝑎 ( 𝑥 𝑝𝑗 −𝑥̅ 𝑝) (1)
𝑗 𝑝 𝑝
𝑆𝑝
where 𝑥 denotes the asset p, and 𝑥̅ denotes a mean of household in the sample. s is a standard
𝑝
deviation of asset 𝑥 , and the p-dimensional vector of weight is chosen to maximize the sample variance
𝑝
of A, subject to ∑ 𝑎2 = 1 . The weight a is also called the vector of scores of asset variables, which
𝑝 𝑝
can be estimated using principal-components analysis. Higher value of the asset index means a higher
access to the asset. The asset index is standardized to have a mean of zero and standard deviation of
one.
28
Out of 961 surveyed households, only 15.5 per cent of them recorded female as the household
head, of which most are from Kinh ethnic. The average of household size in the endline survey
remained the same as in baseline (nearly 5.2 people per household).
In general, a higher percentage of primary caregivers reported to be fluent in Vietnamese than
in the baseline survey (82.4 per cent), with Kon Tum accounted for 94.2 per cent. Particularly,
primary caregivers with ability to speak Vietnamese are more likely to receive a high level of
education, evidenced by 90.6 per cent completing high school (and over) in comparison with
67.2 per cent without qualifications. Women with the role of primary caregivers account for
nearly three fourths in the total sample of 961 households. This implies that women still take
the central role in 0-8 aged child-rearing, but this rate tends to decline in comparison with the
situation 3 years ago.
Regarding the educational qualification of primary caregiver, approximately 34 per cent of
caregivers acquired no qualification, while only 16.7 per cent claimed to finish at least high
school (or even higher) degree. There is a lower rate of primary caregivers without any degree
that participated in the endline survey compared to those from the baseline. Notably,
caregivers from households with the lowest wealth quintiles tend to be less likely to complete
high school (5 per cent out of 206 households) than households in the highest wealth quintiles
(40 per cent out of 192 households).

Summary of key findings from the endline survey
The Programme has been implemented in a turbulent environment. This includes changes in
provincial PMU staff and government officials that had worked together to develop the
Programme. This was further exacerbated with the Covid-19 pandemic which caused the
Programme to adjust multiple activities. Despite these factors, IECD is evaluated as a
successful programme.
Two thirds of the key indicators covering three main sectors namely nutrition & health,
education, and child protection have shown improvement from its benchmark values. Financial
resources were utilized efficiently, resulting in the achievement of most important objectives.
There were some areas that did not show as impressive performance as the others at the time
of the endline evaluation, namely IYCF or early stimulation. To a certain extent, the Programme
has incorporated the human right-based programming, gender equality and equity principles
and approaches in its design and implementation.
When comparing provinces, Dien Bien's figures remain the lowest in most measures, but the
province has made significant progress since the baseline period, particularly in healthcare.
Kon Tum has maintained a consistent level of performance throughout all thematic areas,
making steady improvement. Gia Lai, on the other hand, is frequently an outlier.
Detailed evaluation of key indicators, broken down into themes, is presented below.
4.2 Child Health
Infant and Young Child Feeding
Percentage of village health workers and commune health workers at
Indicator 11 grass root levels in the project locations are able to perform Infant and
Young Children Feeding (IYCF) counselling
Proper Infant and young child feeding (IYCF) can promote their optimal growth and
development, especially in the critical window from birth to 2 years of age. IYCF counselling
by skilled local health workers plays an essential role, particularly for first-time parents as they
closely accompany mothers from pregnancy till delivery and during childcare. UNICEF
highlights that communication alone is insufficient to improve breastfeeding and
complementary feeding practices and emphasizes that counselling and support by skilled
health workers at grassroot levels contributes a lot to the improvement.
To assess the capability of the community health workers in IYCF counselling, the survey
questionnaire asked the head of the commune health centres how many of their healthcare
staff at commune and village levels were able to perform IYCF counselling. That is, they either
received training on IYCF or actually performed IYCF counselling for caregivers. In this context,
‘training’ refers to formal training of all forms provided by nutritionists and experts at higher-
level centres, for example district-level or provincial level.
Survey results show that the percentage of local health workers able to perform IYCF
counselling has decreased in the endline compared to the baseline, except for Gia Lai
province (see Figure 9). The decrease is attributed to the fact that the number of the commune
35
and village health workers able to perform IYCF counselling witnesses a slight increase but
the total number of health workers grows at a larger rate. For example, in Kon Tum province,
the number of IYCF counselling-qualified health workers declines from 30 to 32 while the total
number of health workers increases from 47 to 60.

The increase in the percentage of IYCF counselling-qualified health workers in Gia Lai
province can be explained by the increase in the training rate (see Figure 10). Dien Bien
province, on the contrary, records a reduced training rate and Kon Tum province experiences
no change in the rate.

KII with head of the commune health centres in Dien Bien and Gia Lai reveal several reasons
for the low training rate. First, not every health worker in the center received IYCF training.
Usually only the head or vice head of the center was invited to the training. Second, in the year
2021, under the COVID-19’s pandemic impact, no expanded IYCF training has been
conducted for health wokers who works at the village level as planned . Third, as stated above,
there have been new local health workers involved in the healthcare system without IYCF
training.
“
This year I have not participated in any training.
Other workers in the health center still need more training to improve their capacity.
KII with head of commune health center in Dien Bien province
“
This commune health center has three workers but only me and the vice head were invited
to the training. After the training on nutrition, we are more confident in communicating with
people about the signs and side effects of the medicine.
This year I have not participated in any training by UNICEF.

Percentage of children aged 0-23 months in project locations who are

put to the breast within one hour of birth
Early breastfeeding provides protection against infection and has been shown to prevent
neonatal death due to sepsis, pneumonia, diarrhoea and hypothermia11. Delayed initiation of
breastfeeding after the first hour of birth doubled the risk of neonatal mortality12.
Among 228 children aged 0-23 months surveyed, 220 of them (equivalent to 96 per cent) were
ever breastfed at some point and 129 children (equivalent to 57 per cent) were breastfed within
one hour of birth. Compared with baseline, the percentage of children aged 0-23 months put
to breast within one hour of birth in the endline has increased, except for Gia Lai province (see

The percentage does not vary much between boys and girls. Early breastfeeding practices
tend to increase as educational level of primary caregiver improves, but do not show upward
trends as household income raises (see Figure 12).
Initiation of breastfeeding within one hour of birth is more popular among multiparous women
than first-time mothers. Mothers who had two or more infants had higher odds of timely
initiation of breastfeeding within one hour of birth compared with mothers who had one infant.
Concerning ethnicity of the household head, H’Mong and Xo Dang people practice early
breastfeeding very well, evidenced by the higher-than-average percentage of children aged 0-
23 months old put to breast within one hour of birth. Kinh, Thai and Gie Trieng people practice
quite well and the percentage of the three ethnic groups are very close to the average.
Meanwhile, Ba Na and Gia Rai people have very low percentage, which partly explains why
Gia Lai province witnesses the lowest percentage. KII with the head of commune health center
in Gia Lai province reveals that the low percentage of children from Ba Na and Gia Rai groups
put to breast within one hour of birth is associated with the high percentage of home birth
observed in these groups.

Age-appropriate nutrition
Percentage of children aged 6-23 months in project location received
Indicator 18 age-appropriate nutrition and early stimulation/learning from parents/
primary caregivers
Inappropriate nutrition and lack of stimulation in the first years of life could lead to dramatic
abnormalities in brain development (Shonkoff and Phillips, 2000). Black et al. (2016) estimated
the risk of being permanently stunted by malnutrition and the lack of early learning
opportunities through early stimulation would threat the development potential and lifelong
health of 43 per cent children under 5 in low- and middle-income countries. Single-sector
interventions which represent either ECD or nutrition have contributed to positive child
development and/or nutrition status, however, the development and testing of integrated
interventions are currently advocated (Hurley, Yousafzai and Lopez-Boo, 2016).
To measure the percentage of children aged 6-23 months receiving age-appropriate nutrition,
both baseline and endline survey asked their parents/ primary caregivers about their
39
breastfeeding as well as complementary feeding practices during the previous d. The survey
questions and indicator’s calculations are adapted from UNICEF’s MICS6 definition of
“minimum acceptable diet”. Accordingly, a 6-23 month old child is recognized as receiving age-
appropriate nutrition if they had at least minimum dietary diversity and minimum meal
frequency during the previous day.
Minimum dietary diversity Minimum meal frequency
Children receive food from at least 5 of the 8 For breastfeeding children:
groups listed below. i) Age 6-8 months: Solid, semi-solid, or soft foods
• Breastmilk at least two times a day
• Grains, roots, and tubers ii) Age 9-23 months: Solid, semi-solid, or soft
• Legumes and nuts foods at least three times a day
• Dairy products (milk, infant formula,
yogurt, cheese)
For non-breastfeeding children: Solid, semi-solid,
• Flesh foods (meat, fish, poultry and
soft, or milk feeds at least four times a day
liver/organ meats)
• Eggs
• Vitamin A rich fruits and vegetables
• Other fruits and vegetables
To measure the percentage of children aged 6-23 months receiving early stimulation, both
baseline and endline survey asked their parents/ primary caregivers if anyone in the household
practiced certain exercises with their children over the last 3 days. The survey questions and
indicator’s calculations are adapted from "Care for Child Development - Paricipant Manual" by
WHO and UNICEF. Early stimulation exercises can be either in “Play” or “Communication”
group. To be considered as receiving early stimulation, children must receive at least one
practice of each group.

Figure 13 compares the percentage of children aged 6-23 months receiving age-appropriate
nutrition and early stimulation from their parent or primary caregiver between baseline and
endline. Survey results show that there has been an improvement in the percentage in
endline compared with baseline, except for Dien Bien province. Kon Tum province and
Gia Lai province witness a significant growth from 5.1 per cent to 15.6 per cent and from 6.9
per cent to 11.6 per cent, respectively.

Age-appropriate nutrition
Twice as much as surveyed parents/ primary caregivers are likely to meet the minimum meal
frequency than to meet the minimum dietary diversity. Overall in three provinces, 73 per cent
of surveyed parents/ primary caregivers feed their children a sufficient number of meals per
day while only 34 per cent afford minimum food diversity.
41
The percentage of children receiving appropriate nutrition does not vary between boys and
girls. The percentage shows upward trend as household income increases or educational level
of primary caregiver improves (see Figure 16). However, the percentage decreases as the
households have more children. That is, multiparous households are less likely to afford age-
appropriate nutrition for their children than single-child households.
Concerning ethnicity of the household head, age-appropriate nutrition is more prevalent among
Kinh, Thai, Xo Dang and Gie Trieng groups than Ba Na, Gia Rai and H’Mong groups,
evidenced by their higher than average percentage. This is a note-worthy finding and suggests
an improvement in the nutrition diet among ethnic minority children compared with baseline.
FGD with ethnic minority parents indicates that the IYCF counselling is a great help to them in
meal preparation.
KII with head of the commune health center in Dien Bien province indicates that H’Mong
children’s nutritional diets heavily depend on their households’ eating habits and economic
situation.
“
Even though the propaganda has been going on, mothers in H’Mong and Kho-mu groups still
feed their children with rice earlier than recommended. Also, their diets do not meet the
minimum dietary diversity and quantity.
Thai mothers are more likely to follow the recommendations, however, their poverty does not
allow them to feed their children well.

Early stimulation/learning
The percentage of children aged 6-23 months receiving early stimulation/learning from
parents/ caregivers declines from 37.9 per cent to 35.3 per cent. To be specific, the percentage
of children receiving either “Play” and “Communication” excercises also decline, from 39 per
cent to 35.9 per cent and from 92.4 per cent to 89.8 per cent.
The percentage of children receiving early stimulation is slightly higher among girls than boys.
The percentage shows a clear upward trend as household income increases or educational
level of primary caregiver improves (see Figure 17).
Concerning ethnicity of the household head, early stimulation is more widely practiced among
Kinh, Gia Rai and Ba Na people, evidenced by their higher than average percentages of
children receiving early stimulation, at approximately 50 and over 50 per cent. On the contrary,
less than one third of surveyed Thai, H’Mong, Xo Dang and Gie Trieng people practice early
stimulation with their children.

Child Stunting
Indicator 1 Percentage of children under five who are stunted
Vietnam has achieved significant progress in reducing undernutrition over the past several
decades, proven by the fact that the stunting rate among children under five in Vietnam
declines from 43.2% in 2000 to 19.6% in 202013. However, ethnic minority groups are being
systematically left behind and this is limiting progress on national reductions. Therefore,
children’s stunting remains an issue in three project provinces where a large proportion of
population are ethnic minority groups.
There is a difference in the source of data of children’s height between baseline and endline
assessment. The baseline assessment relies on the research team’s own measurement
13 World Bank. Prevalence of stunting, height for age (% of children under 5) – Vietnam.
<https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.STA.STNT.ZS?locations=VN>
44
data while the endline evaluation uses data provided by commune health centers.
Therefore, comparisons between baseline and endline statistics are made with great
caution.
World Health Organization (WHO) Growth Standards are used as the reference point for
determining children who were stunted14. Children whose height-for-age is more than two
standard deviations below the median of the reference population are considered short for
their age or stunted.
Figure 18 Error! Reference source not found. compares the stunting rate among children
under five between baseline and endline. Survey results show that the stunting rate has
remarkably reduced in all three provinces. In fact, at the reduction rate of approximately
5% per year in 3 years of IECD programme implementation, the stunting rate has achieved
significant improvement in comparison with national and provincial average reduction rate.

The stunting rate among children under five is attributed to multiple factors, which include but
not limit to: (i) IYCF knowledge and practices of parents and primary caregivers (indicator 21);
(ii) accessibility to standard WASH facilities (indicator 3); (iii) prenatal care during pregnancy
to avoid maternal malnutrition (indicator 6), and particularly (iv) the percentage of children aged
6-23 months receiving age-appropriate nutrition as well as early stimulation (indicator 18). The
improvement in such indicators accounts for the reduced stunting rate among young children.
Figure 19 indicates that similar to baseline assessment, stunting is far more prevalent among
ethnic minority children than Kinh children. In fact, the stunting rate among ethnic minority
children is twice as much as that of Kinh children, at 36.2 per cent versus 18.9 per cent. It is a
pity that data provided by commune health centres do not tell the specific ethnic group so the
research team does not compare the stunting rate among each ethnic groups.

4.3 WASH
The types of drinking water and sanitation facilities are important determinants of the health
status of children. Proper hygienic practices can reduce the seriousness of major childhood
diseases such as diarrhoea.
People in humanitarian situations who access safe drinking water as
Indicator 10
per agreed sector/cluster coordination standards and norms
The indicator aimed to explore what kind of water households in humanitarian situations used
for drinking. In this context ‘humanitarian situations’ refers to natural disaster of all kinds that
have negative impact on the availability and quality of household water supply. Following
international standards stated in MICS tabulation plan, safe drinking water source is
considered as any of the following: piped water into dwelling/yard/plot/neighbour, public
tap/standpipe, tube well/borehole, protected dug well, protected spring, rainwater, tanker-
truck, cart with small tank and packaged water.
In the endline survey, 1,719 people reported finding themselves in humanitarian situation over
the past 12 months, of whom 460 are from Dien Bien province, 999 are from Kon Tum province
and 260 are from Gia Lai province.
Survey results show that there has been an improvement in the percentage of people in
humanitarian situations accessing safe drinking water in all three provinces (see Figure

Indicator 3 Proportion of the population having an improved sanitation facility
Following international standards, improved toilet facilities include flush/pour flush to piped
sewer system or septic tank; flush/pour flush to pit latrine; biogas; direct double dry pit toilet
and ventilated improved pit latrine.
Figure 21 compares the percentage of household member having an improved sanitation
facility between baseline and endline. Survey results show that there has been an
improvement in the percentage in endline compared with baseline in all three provinces.
Similar to baseline, Dien Bien province records the highest percentage of household members
having improved sanitation facility, at 61.6 per cent. Flush/pour flush to pit latrine and flush/pour
flush to piped sewer system or septic tank are two most popular types of improved sanitation
facility in Dien Bien. Noticeably, 27.3 per cent of surveyed household members do not have
any facility.
The percentage for Kon Tum is less than that, at 45 per cent although the province has the
largest percentage of households having sanitation facility (at 91.9 per cent). Noticeably, 34.1
per cent of surveyed household members use simple pit latrine (dug pit) – a type of unimproved
sanitation facility.
Gia Lai stands lowest in the chart in terms of proportion of population having access to
sanitation facility and more importantly access to improved sanitation facility, at 25.2 per cent.
Open defecation is still commonly practiced in Gia Lai and made up more than half of surveyed
households (51.7 per cent).

Household access to improved sanitation facility widely varies among ethnic groups, of which
Thai ethnic group records the largest percentage of household members with access to
improved sanitation facility, at nearly 90 per cent (see Figure 22). Meanwhile, Gia Rai, Ba Na
and Xo Dang all stand low, with the percentage ranging from 18.3 per cent to 31.9 per cent.
This finding is consistent with the findings in the Viet Nam Rural, Agriculture and Fishery
48
Census 2016 that Gia Rai and Ba Na ethnic group stand at the bottom of the chart in terms of
household access to septic tank or semi-septic tank toilet.
Figure 22 also suggests that access to improved sanitation facility remarkably increases as
household wealth improves.

UNICEF and partner support (leveraged/indirect)
UNICEF in partnership with the Government of Viet Nam is working to achieve Sustainable
Development Goal 6 on clean water and sanitation as well as Viet Nam’s global commitments
to become open defecation free (ODF) by 2025.
In the effort to fulfil the commitment, over the past few years the Viet Nam Health Environment
Management Agency has collaborated with UNICEF to pilot “ODF community model”, a key
component of which is the joint Community-Led Total Sanitation programme between Ministry
of Health and many NGOs (such as UNICEF, SNV Netherlands Development Organisation,
World Vision, Church World Service, Plan). Dien Bien, Gia Lai and Kon Tum were among
seven provinces selected for the programme.
The certification of ODF community for villages and communes is approved by the Chairman
of District People's Committee and reviewed after every three years.
49
Results from endline survey indicate that at the commune level, the number of ODF-certified
communes in three provinces increases from 4 communes to 5 communes (see Table
13). Similar to baseline assessment, there is no ODF-certified commune in Gia Lai province.

According to the ODF protocol, a commune is ODF certified if 100 per cent of its villages are
ODF certified and 100 per cent of its health centres and schools (main branches) have access
to water, improved sanitation facility and a designated place for handwashing with soap. The
reason why not every commune is certified ODF although more than half of the villages receive
ODF certification lies in the unfulfillment of second criteria.
Proportion of pre-schools/IECD centres with WASH facilities meeting
Indicator 32
national/JMP standards
The indicator aims to assess the quality of WASH facilities in the school and health centre
settings to guarantee a standard physical environment for children. The assessment criteria in
use are JMP standards within the framework of WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme
for Water and Sanitation that supports the inclusion of WASH as part of the SDGs.

JMP monitoring system involves a multi-level service ladders that enable countries at different
stages of development to track and compare progress. There are separate ladders for water,
sanitation and hygiene. Within each category, the core service ladders include three levels: no
service, limited service and basic service where the ‘basic’ service threshold corresponds to
the SDG indicator (see Figure 23 and Figure 24). In this endline assessment, the ‘basic’
threshold is also selected as assessment criteria. The survey questions are adapted from the
2016 JMP programme document that provides harmonized indicators and core questions to
collect data on “basic” water, sanitation and handwashing in schools and health centres.

About preschools:
Although 100 per cent of surveyed preschools have at least one usable improved toilet for girls
and one for boys, fewer meet the criteria for a basic handwashing facility. That accounts for
the wide variety in the number of preschools with qualified WASH facilities among provinces.
The low coverage of basic handwashing facility is attributed to the fact that: (i) preschools have
handwashing facility but no soap and/ or water available at the time of the survey; or (ii)
preschools have no handwashing facility. This highlights the challenge of designing and
maintaining handwashing facilities so that soap and water are available to students for
handwashing at critical times, given the scientific evidence that the handwashing practices
help to prevent diarrhoea which is responsible for 10 per cent of under-5 child mortality15.
About health centres:
The main reason for the unqualified WASH facilities in health centres is the lack of usable toilet
designated for all types of users, especially for staff and girls/women. JMP standards specify
that a commune health centre should have usable and separated sanitation facilities for four
types of users: patients, staff, girls/women and people with limited mobility. This issue remains
since baseline and has not been well addressed till endline.
Another noteworthy finding is that the newly constructed health centres (such as in Chieng So
and Hang Lia commune, Dien Bien province and in Dak Glei town, Kon Tum province) do not
have WASH facilities that meet the requirements.

Handwashing is a hygiene practice that plays a critical role in battling diseases and
malnutrition. In addition to observing schools if they have a designated facility for group
handwashing, the endline assessment did observe the daily group handwashing by students
in schools in project communes during the year of survey – 2021.
The sample includes 27 preschools and 24 primary schools whose students have lunch at
school, of which 27 preschools and 14 primary schools had their students practice group
handwashing before lunch at the time of the survey. In comparison with baseline

Interestingly, the group handwashing practice seems not to depend on the availability of group
handwashing facility at schools, evidenced by the fact that schools with group handwashing
practice outnumbers schools with group handwashing facility (see Figure 26). This raises a
concern whether the current facility at schools are sufficient to guarantee standard
handwashing practices.

Percentage of children aged 36-59 months in project locations on track

Literacy-numeracy, physical, social-emotional and learning)
Image 3. Children in Kon Tum, taken by MDRI’s enumerator
Source: MDRI endline survey and evaluation, 2021
One of the main focuses of the IECD programme is the development of children. This is a
continuous process, in which children learn to move, think, speak, feel and communicate to
others. Vital domains of a child’s overall development include physical growth, literacy and
numeracy skills, socio-emotional development, and readiness to learn. In both baseline and
endline, the research team use a module of four key questions to explore the developmental
status of children aged 36-59 months. These questions are based on the module in the MICS
to determine whether children are developmentally on track in four domains:
• Literacy-numeracy: Children are identified as being developmentally on track based on
whether they can identify/name at least 10 letters of the alphabet, can read at least four
simple, popular words, and know the name and recognize the symbols of all numbers
from one to ten. If at least two of these criteria are met, the child is considered
developmentally on track.
• Physical: If the child can pick up a small object with two fingers, like a stick or a rock
from the ground and/or the child is not sometimes too sick to play, then the child is
regarded as being developmentally on track in the physical domain.
• Social-emotional: Children are considered to be developmentally on track if two of the
following criteria are met: (i) the child gets along well with other children; (ii) the child
does not kick, bite or hit other children and (iii) the child does not get easily distracted.
• Learning: If the child follows simple directions on how to do something correctly and/or
when given something to do, the child is able to do it independently, then the child is
considered to be developmentally on track in this domain.
Figure 27 compares the percentage of children aged 36-59 months in project locations on track
in at least three of four developmental domains between baseline and endline. Survey results
show that there has been a slight improvement in the percentage in endline compared
with baseline.
54
Similar to the baseline assessment, Dien Bien province has the highest proportion of children
being developmentally on track, at least three of the four domains (86.8 per cent). Meanwhile
no significant difference is observed between Kon Tum (72.7 per cent) and Gia Lai (72.3 per
cent). Regarding four domains of child development, the survey results find that more than one
third (31.4 per cent) of children are on track in the literacy-numeracy domain, but more so in
the physical (97.1 per cent), social-emotional (77.1 per cent) and learning (92 per cent)
domains. In each province, the proportion of children on track in the literacy-numeracy domain
is also lower than in other domains. Even though literacy-numeracy learning activities could
take place in both school setting and home setting, the fact that school closures and reduced
school attendance due to COVID-19 have limited children’s access to such activities.

The percentage of children aged 36-59 months on track in at least 3 out of 4 developmental
domains widely varies across ethnic groups (see Figure 28). Thai, H’Mong, Gia Rai and Gie
Trieng groups have the higher than average percentage. Compared with baseline assessment
in which Gie Trieng group stands lowest, Gie Trieng group makes a significiant improvement.
Meanwhile, the percentage recorded among Xo Dang and Ba Na groups are lower than
average.
Figure 28 displays no significant difference in the percentage of children on track in at least 3
of 4 developmental domains observed by children’s gender (76.4 per cent for boys versus 79.3
per cent for girls). By wealth index quintiles, the proportion of children in the poorest
households on track (69.9 per cent) is lower than those in the richest households (88.6 per
cent). Among other wealth index quintiles, there is no remarkable difference. However, a
noticeable difference is found between children with primary caregivers’ education level being
at highschool and higher and those with primary caregivers not completing any education level
(90.2 per cent versus 71.2 per cent).

4.5 Maternal Health
Maternal health is defined as the health of women during pregnancy, childbirth and the
postnatal period. There is scientific evidence to confirm that most maternal deaths are
preventable and treatable in the presence of professional healthcare services and a supportive
environment. Therefore, improving maternal health and ending preventable maternal deaths
is always a top priority to ensure women and babies reach their full potential as well as attaining
MDG 4 & 5.
This section identifies key determinants of maternal health care namely supplementation,
antenatal care coverage, and institutional delivery; and compares the trends and results
among women in different project areas.
Supplementation
Number of pregnant women who receive iron and folic acid
Indicator 6
supplementation
56
Due to increased nutritional needs for both the mothers and the babies during pregnancy,
expecting women are strongly recommended by WHO to supplement iron and folic acid in
order to avoid fatal obstetric complications stemming from micronutrient deficiencies. These
micronutrients are only needed in small quantities but are essential for fetal growth and
development. As part of the IECD package to be provided under UNICEF interventions,
pregnant women in the three project provinces have been covered by the multiple
micronutrient supplementation service which aims to increase the micronutrient intake during
pregnancy for low-income families.
Endline results indicated a nearly 17% increase in the total number of pregnant women
receiving supplementation, compared to baseline (Figure 29). Among different kinds of
supplements, iron-folic tablets stood out as the most popular ones (41%), far outweighing the
second most chosen option – multiple micronutrient supplements (8%). At baseline, none of
the surveyed pregnant women took multiple micronutrient supplements.

Project’s impacts have been monumental in Dien Bien and Kon Tum, especially the latter
province where the difference between baseline (without intervention) and endline (with
intervention) was nearly four-fold. The improvement in Gia Lai, however, was not as impressive
as in the other two provinces (only 4% percentage points difference between baseline and
endline).
Key informants from qualitative interviews did make some veiled insinuations about the
performance of this indicator in Gia Lai:
“
[…] The provision of micronutrient supplements for children and women were often
interrupted. The latest interruption happened since July (2021) for pregnant women’s
supplementation and since May (2021) for children supplementation. It occurs almost every
year

Child Delivery
Percentage of women aged 15-49 years with a live birth in the last 2
Indicator 23 years in project locations who were attended by skilled health
personnel during their most recent live birth
Rigorous research has proven that skilled birth attendance can help reduce MMR rate as most
maternal and neo-natal deaths occur during delivery or immediate post-partum period. Skilled
birth attendance encompasses a health care professional (such as midwife, doctor,
obstetrician, nurse,..), an enabling environment (adequate medicines, equipment, supporting
system and policies), and community acceptance of obstetric services.
To evaluate Indicator 23, the quantitative survey asked women aged 15-49 years with a live
birth in the last 2 years if they were assisted by at least one skilled attendant during the most
recent live birth. Among the surveyed women, 61% were attended by at least one trained
attendant (doctor, nurse, midwives) and only 1% went through a delivery without any
assistance. The respective figures for baseline were 55% and 2.7%. Both Dien Bien and Kon
Tum showed progressive improvement despite the slow rate, surprisingly, none of the
interviewed women in these two provinces gave birth alone in the past two years.
Unfortunately, Gia Lai was the outlier in this Indicator with a slight decrease in the percentage
of women receiving birth assistance by professionals (Figure 30 - left) and also an increase in
the proportion of women undergoing the most recent live birth single-handed (Figure 30 - right).
However, the latter scenario happened in a relatively small sample size - one Gia Rai
household and two Ba Na households whose communities often reside in remote areas and
preserve traditional child delivery customs. One possible explanation for Gia Lai’s
underperformance in this indicator could be the fact that Gia Lai imposed stricter social
distancing regulations during the resurgence of the 4th Covid wave, compared to the other two
provinces. Also, public reluctance to visit hospitals for fear of infection would be another logical
justification.

An important finding from the endline assessment that might comparatively tell the beneficial
impact of IECD interventions is that the presence of skilled personnel such as “doctors” and
“community/village health workers” to assist women at delivery experienced a major increase
whereas the figures for “relative/friend and traditional birth attendant” witnessed a downward
trend throughout a three-year period (Figure 31).

Even for some ethnic groups such as H’Mong and Ba Na who had the lowest rate of skilled
birth attendance, fewer H’Mong and Ba Na women were attended by relatives/friends than
before while the proportion of women assisted by doctors managed to climb higher from
baseline period. This is already perceived as an appreciable improvement.
59
Disaggregated data presented in Figure 32 may cast light on some of the factors associated
with assisted births. A general look at Figure 32 revealed that the percentage of women giving
birth with professional staff is proportional to education level and household income. To be
more specific, skilled birth attendance is more prevalent among women holding at least
secondary school graduate degree and in households that ranked 3rd and above in the wealth
quintile. In addition, another striking discovery from the endline result would certainly be the
rise of Gie Trieng ethnic group to score the highest (95%) in this indicator, surpassing
baseline’s top positions of Kinh and Thai people. However, the gap between the highest group
(Gie Trieng) and the lowest (H’Mong) at endline is still as large as 66% percentage points.

Proportion of births in project locations that were delivered at a health
Indicator 25
facility
Institutional delivery enable doctors to prevent, detect and manage obestric complications
arisen during and immediate after giving birth. The Ministry of Health has set the minimum
target for this indicator at over 97% and over 85% in disadvantaged areas as in the National
Action Plan on reproductive health care, with a focus on the health of mothers, newborns and
children during 2021 – 2015 period.
However, reducing home-based delivery rates especially in the upland areas is a major
challenge not only because health facilities are harder to access but maternal health care
services are also not properly aligned with the social and cultural context of the local people.
For example, the Ba Na and H’Mong ethnic group have their customs of giving birth at home
with the support of a traditional midwife (usually an old women who were experienced with
labor but did not receive any technical training) and often feel reluctant to deliver at a health
60
facility due to psychological barrieres (feeling embarrassed if having contact with strange
people at delivery). With that being said, if an intervention neglects certain cultural preferences
or refuses to accommodate traditional practices (ie: allowing relatives to be present at
delivery), it is highly likely that institutional delivery will be disregarded despite improved access
to quality.
To advocate institutional births, besides communication programs to boost awareness,
UNICEF Vietnam also recognizes the importance of capacity building for health personnels at
all levels including the traditional midwives at remote villages. This allows three project
provinces to gradually increase the rate of institutional births but also to mitigate the risk of
family-based delivery, thus potentially contributing to fight inequalities.
Similar to Indicator 23, for this indicator, the quantitative survey asked the information from
women who successfully gave birth in the past two years. In this survey, health facility refers
to commune health centres, maternity houses, private health facilities, and district hospital/or
higher, according to MICS’s definition.
As evident in Figure 33, except for Gia Lai province, the percentage of women going to health
facilities for child delivery has increased at endline, compared to baseline. Of 269 pregnant
women interviewed in the endline survey, about 63% of them were delivered at a health facility,
which is 7% higher than baseline’s starting point. Despite an overall improvement, Dien Bien
remains the province with the lowest rate.

Even though the popularity trend of delivery places does not vary much from baseline with
district hospitals and homes being the most selected choices, the ascending shift in favor of
the former and the descending pattern of the latter is worth mentioning, implying that project
interventions are on the right track (see Figure 34).

There is quite a positive correlation between level of education, economic status and the
likelihood of facility-based delivery in the three project provinces (see Figure 35).

In particular, women already completed high school and above and/or living in wealthier
households (4th quintile and above) reported a higher probability of institutional births, as
62
illustrated in Figure 35. Comparison across different ethnic groups signifies that giving birth at
a health facility is rather common among Gie Trieng, Thai, Kinh and Gia Rai people (> 80%)
but not yet preferred by H’Mong and Ba Na communities (< 40%). The substantial gap between
ethnicities once again poses a pressing need for all stakeholders to put combating inequality
in health care at the heart of their agenda. Last but not least, the number of children per
household is also in inverse proportion to facility-based delivery, according to endline results.
In other words, women having three or more children are 30% less likely to give birth at a
hospital/commune health center than those who have a single child.
Focus group discussion with PMU representatives in Gia Lai province did provide certain
justifications for the lower endline result of this indicator compared to baseline as well as some
difficulties faced by the programme when trying to influence ethnic minority communities.
Notably, the decrease in the proportion of institutional births of Gia Lai province may partly be
attributed to the absence of Kbang district in the endline sample size, given the fact that this
district has a higher socio-economic status than the other two surveyed districts.
“
[…] Kbang has an advantage that their ethnic minorties are more educated. It is easier to
implement activities at health facilities or healthcare programs in Kbang than in Mang Yang
district. The people in Mang Yang are mostly Ba Na who are still keeping many traditional
customs. For example, in Ayun commune (Mang Yang district), the home-based delivery
rate used to be 99%; people did not attend any antenatal visit. However, after implementing
the IECD program, the rate started to decline but it is still very difficult for them to travel
long distance to the district hospital especially when it is raining. In that case (home-based
delivery), the people will call the village health worker/midwife to assist them. That is
already a major improvement compared to previous (delivery at home with skilled
attendant)
FGD with PMU representatives in Gia Lai province.
Services will continue to be underutilized if the perceived benefits of attending a health facility
are not seen by women and their families to outweigh potential harms and costs. Those who
have the means to bypass commune level facilities may access higher quality facilities that are
further away, potentially reinforcing inequities.
Another sharing of the head of a commune health center in Gia Lai province also gave further
hints about positive impacts of the IECD programme in the maternal health sector. When asked
about an achievement that is beyond her expectation, she cited UNICEF’s contribution to uplift
the percentage of women attending prenatal check-ups and delivering at commune health
center through the offer of training and travel subsidy to village midwives. This clearly
demonstrates that culturally-appropriate maternity care has been incorporated into the
programme design in order to better encourage service utilization as well as patient
satisfaction.
63
“
[…] Thanks to UNICEF’s interventions such as technical training and travel cost coverage,
traditional midwives in upland villages are more motivated to go down here (commune
health center) to assist delivery. Before it was only 1-2 cases/month. Now it goes up to 5-
7 cases/month

Prenatal Care Check-ups
Percentage of women aged 15-49 years with a live birth in the last 2
Indicator 24 years in project locations who were attended at least four times by any
provider during their last pregnancy that led to a live birth
WHO recommends that all pregnant women shall receive at least four antenatal care check-
ups, with the first visit occurring during the first trimester. The “four-times” standard is also
included in the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) under the Global MICS Survey
Programme coordinated by GSO and UNICEF Vietnam.
Antenatal visits play a pivotal role in childbirth planning and serve as a critical entry point into
the formal health system for rural or ethnic minority women in disadvantaged areas who would
otherwise resort to traditional unhealthy behaviors. The endline survey asked the number of
prenatal care check-ups attended by women who delivered birth within the two year period
preceding the survey.
It can be concluded from Figure 36 that the ICED programme did generate a number of
beneficial effects on the antenatal care coverage in general, most notable in Dien Bien and
Kon Tum province where the endline rates grew larger by 9% and 11% respectively. Likewise,
the number of women who attended at least one antenatal visit also increased from 302/376
surveyed women (80%) to 225/269 (84%) after three years. On the other hand, there has also
been a decrease in the percentage of women with no prenatal check-up throughout the last
pregnancy from 20% at baseline to 16% at endline.

In acknowledgment of the commendable remarks, existing challenges need to be well taken
into accounts. First, despite the upward trend, the overall antenatal care coverage remains low
(< 30%). Second, disparities between ethnicity, income status, educational attainment are
widely recognized (see Figure 37). The percentage-point difference between the highest value
and the lowest can be as broad as 8 times. For instance, the attendance rate of women in the
richest group (5th quintile) reached 75.6% while the figures for the lower quintiles were far
behind – at 23.5%, 24%, 9.7% and 13.1%, in descending order. Surprisingly, not the lowest
quintile but the 2nd quintile group possessed the most limited antenatal care coverage. On a
similar pattern, the proportion of women having attended at least four antenatal visits in the
latest pregnancy was the highest among those who already graduated from highschool and
over (55.3%); and lowest among those without education or just finished pre-primary level
(9%). Last but not least, except for the Kinh and Thai, most ethnic groups in the surveyed pool
still recorded a relatively low frequency of antenatal care visits (<30%), most apparent among
H’Mong and Ba Na communities.

Generally, the endline status of maternal health indicators (6, 23, 24, 25) did validate the efforts
of ICED programme implementers in upgrading the overall delivery model. However, there is
still a lot of work to be done when it comes to inequality eradication and improved healthcare
access, quality and resources for highly vulnerable population subgroups, especially the ethnic
minorities (H’Mong, Ba Na, Xo Dang, …).
4.6 Education
Early childhood education
Percentage of ECE centres, including family-based childcare groups in
Indicator 31 project locations which have minimum IECD equipment and early
learning/ stimulation services for young children
One of the UNICEF IECD programme’s immediate objectives is that the project’s targeted
areas will have accessible minimum IECD services in place with acceptable quality for parents,
caregivers and children. To contribute to measuring the achievement of this objective, Indicator
31 was set out to record the percentage of ECE centres, including family-based childcare
groups in the project areas which (i) have minimum IECD equipment and (ii) provide early
learning/ stimulation services for young children.
66
A preschool is determined to "have minimum IECD equipment" if it has the necessary
equipment and facility as required by MOET in two Circulars 02/2010/TT-BGD-DT and
34/2013/TT-BGD-DT. At the time of the endline, 100% of ECE centres, including family-
based childcare groups in the three project provinces were found to have minimum
IECD equipment.
To assess the percentage of ECE centres having early learning/ stimulation services for young
children, in the baseline, three services were determined, namely parent counselling, early
stimulation, and social and emotional learning. In the endline, another service concerning
positive discipline (non-violent approach) was added. The results showed that 81.5% of ECE
centres in the three project provinces (22 out of 27 centres) provide all of the
abovementioned four early learning/stimulation services. There are no significant
differences amongst different provinces for this indicator. In Gia Lai, all ECE preschools
already provide positive discipline, social and emotional learning, and parent counselling
services. Early stimulation seems to be the service that is most lacking, with only Dien Bien
having 100% of ECE centres providing this service, while the rates of preschools providing this
service in Gia Lai and Kon Tum are 83.3% and 90.9% respectively. The newly added positive
discipline service was found to be available in all surveyed ECE centres in Gia Lai and Kon
Tum, and in 90% of the surveyed centres in Dien Bien.

Indicator 2
from their parents or caregivers
Science has long acknowledged the importance of early stimulation for children’s
development. In the first 3 years, a child’s brain develops most rapidly, forming 700 to 1000
neural connections every second. Therefore, during these early years, children need to have
parental interaction, so all senses are developed. These early interaction needs to be
optimized to ensure full, timely development of the child including social emotional skills
(UNICEF).
To measure this indicator, the endline survey used the same criteria adopted in the baseline
about “Play” and “Communicate” activities as per the UNICEF and WHO guidelines to assess
the percentage of children receiving early stimulation from their parents or caregivers, which
is disaggregated by age groups. These practices range from providing ways for the baby to
see, hear, and touch their caregivers, to talking to the child and teaching them stories, songs
and games.
It is shown that by the time of the endline, 60.3% of the children aged 0-4 living in the
project areas received early stimulation from their parents or caregiver, demonstrating
a slight increase of 1.7 percentage points from the baseline indicator (Figure 39). Kon
Tum was the province which witnessed the most improvement of 12.2 percentage point,
reaching 68.9% children aged 0-4 receiving both play and communication practices. On the
other hand, a decrease of 10.3 percentage point in this indicator was found in Dien Bien. One
of the contributing factor to this decrease could be that Dien Bien recorded a significant
decrease in the sample size, i.e. the number of children aged 0-4, from 383 children in the
baseline to 262 children in the endline, which suggests that some children aged 0-4 who
received early stimulation and responsive care reported in the baseline already grew out of
this age group at the time of the endline. Moreover, the new households joining the programme
might not have received any training since last year due to Covid, hence the decrease in Dien
Bien.

Percentage of parents/caregivers in project locations who engaged
Indicator 22 with their children aged 0-4 years (under 5) in activities to promote
responsive care including early stimulation
Related to Indicator 21, Indicator 22 measures the percentage of parents/caregivers who
practise responsive care and early stimulation on their children aged 0-4 years. The results
at the endline shows an improvement of 3 percentage point in this indicator in the
project locations (Figure 40). Similar trends found in Indicator 21 were observed here. The
percentage of parents/caregivers who engaged in responsive and early stimulation activities
with their children increased the most in Kon Tum, from 53.8% in the baseline to 65.2% in the
endline. Dien Bien again saw a decrease of 7.8 percentage point in this indicator, with the
province’s sample size lessened by 61 parents/caregivers. Similar to Indicator 2, the possible
explanations include the attrition in the households having 0-4 children, as well as the
disruption of training activities in the last year due to Covid.

Exposure to learning materials
Percentage of households having children aged 0-8 years in the project
Indicator 27 locations who have learning materials (children’s books and

In addition to the responsive interaction with parents/caregivers, young children need to be
exposed to stimulating learning materials such as playthings and books to get the chance to
explore and learn to develop cognitive and literacy skills. The UNICEF’s Nobody’s Perfect
Parenting programme’s content included instructions for parents to make and use simple toys
from household materials to carry out fun and easy play activities with their children. Parents
were also encouraged to give their children a variety of materials to play with and picture books
to read to.
Similar to the baseline, in the endline survey, parents or primary caregivers having children
aged 0-8 years in the project locations were asked if they had children's books, picture books
and toys available at home. Playthings are not limited to toys purchased from a store, but also
include homemade toys such as cloth dolls, bottles and cardboard boxes etc., or objects and
materials found outside the home (rocks, animal shells, leaves ...) which are used by children
to feel, touch, pick and name.

The results show that at the time of the endline survey, the percentage of households having
children aged 0-8 years in the project locations who have children’s books and
playthings slightly improved from 44.4% to 48.2% in total. The biggest improvement was
found in Dien Bien, with the percentage of households having learning material grew by 10.6
percentage point to reach 50.6% at the endline.
Similar to the baseline trends, the endline data suggests that the economic condition of the
household and the education level of the primary caregivers correlate with the
availability of learning materials, including books and play things in the households
(Figure 42). While 75% of the highest income group have learning materials at home, only
70
29.6% of their counterpart in the lowest income group do. The gap between parents/caregivers
with high school and over education level and those with pre-primary and no education is
similarly large (73.1% and 29.5% respectively). Accordingly, in terms of ethnicity, the Thai and
Kinh are the two leading groups in this indicator (at 70.3% and 60.7% respectively), since Kinh
and Thai households are usually in the highest wealth index quintile group and have higher
educational levels.

children from violence, abuse and neglect
Findings from baseline evaluation indicated that 100 per cent of project regions (from
province and district to commune level) committed to implementing local protocols for
protecting children from violence, abuse, and neglect since 2018. Recent reports on the
end-of-project achievement of results mentioned that a Child Protection Management Board
was established and consolidated from provincial to grass-root level, evidenced by the
formation of a Child Protection Committee in all project districts and communes under the
direction of Provincial People’s Committee. This Child Protection Committee takes the main
responsibility for periodic supervision, reviewing and providing support for the provision of child
protection services.

Nevertheless, there is almost no progress in the percentage of children aged 6-8 who would

compared to 3 years ago has been observed, with nearly none of them reported to seek help
from Child Protection Agency (refer to Indicator 26).
Number of child protection workers in UNICEF-supported communes
Indicator 15
who provide case management in line with national standards
Case management plays an essential core function in the child protection system and must be
closely tied with the national legislative process involving the children’s welfare. In most of
global guideline handbooks, the term “case management” is defined as the process of
organizing and carrying out work to address an individual child’s (and their family’s) needs in
an appropriate, systematic, and timely manner, through direct support and/or referrals, and in
accordance with a project or programme’s objectives16. By providing support to address child
protection concerns, case management can directly contribute to the core protection purpose
of preventing and responding to abuse, neglect, exploitation and violence against children.
In recent years, the case management has gained greater familiarity within Vietnam’s child
protection at both central and provincial level. To evaluate the improvement of child protection
workers’ capabilities in delivering case management service, the endline questionnaire asked
the communal leaders to update the list of their staff involved in the case management process.
It was referred to in Circular 56/2017/ND-CP dated 09/05/2017 that regulates six steps in case
management for marginalized children (orphans, children with disabilities, children from poor
households, children affected by HIV/AIDS) or children suffering from abuse, violence or
neglect. Specifically, the procedure includes:
Step 1. Receive and record information of the at-risk child
Step 2. Identify the child’s needs
Step 3. Develop a child support plan
Step 4. Implement the child support plan
Step 5. Monitor and assess the implement of the child support plan
Step 6. Record and keep a record of the child after intervention
Figure 43 below indicates the changes in the number of child protection workers in programme
areas performing at least one step out of six as mentioned above. There is a positive signal
that the total number of commune-level staff participating in case management service

have increased over three years of project implementation, from 113 workers in baseline
to 121 in endline. When comparing the status among three provinces, however, it is
surprisingly noted that Kon Tum is the only province to record a substantial expansion of child
protection staffs, while both Dien Bien and Gia Lai have observed a slight cut-down in their
human resources. Despite that, the impressive point would lay on the fact that child protection
officers who can take charge in all steps of case management have doubled in number
in all three UNICEF-supported provinces. This would imply that a case manager has
currently been capable of handling more steps in the case management process instead
of expansion in the number of workers as before.

Comparing between districts, the variation in the number of case management workers in Dien
Bien and Kon Tum has narrowed down compared with the baseline situation. There is a
notable exception that the number of case managers in Tu Mo Rong district (Kon Tum) was
reported to be three times higher than other two other districts (Dak Glei and Kon Ray).
However, this broad difference is comprehensible considering the district’s socio-economic
characteristics. According to Kon Tum’s PMU head, Tu Mo Rong is the most disadvantaged
district among three project areas in the province. Therefore, to meet the requirements of case
management service in the district, the number of case managers in Tu Mo Rong has
increased significantly in comparison with baseline, from 4 to 31 workers.
Number of Social Work Service Centres (in project locations) applying

Social work was officially classified as a profession in Vietnam in 2010 by Government’s
Decision No. 32/2010-TTg on Development of Social Work Profession. In the child protection
component, social workers take responsibility to assess the problems of children, develop
intervention plans and implement case management, especially for children of abuse/neglect.
In some cases, social workers have to organize and manage alternative care services for
children (for example, kinship care, foster care, adoption, community-based care and
institutional care).
Qualitative findings with PMU members at provincial level revealed that there have been
almost no changes in the number of Social Work Service Centres applying national standards
since the time of conducting baseline survey. To be specific, the baseline assessment pointed
out that a provincial-level social work service centre in accordance with legal standards was
established in all three provinces and only Kon Tum has one more centre located in the city.
Meanwhile, at the time of endline evaluation, Mang Yang (Gia Lai) became the only district
that has newly formed a district-level centre, which serves a role as focal point to provide
support for social workers in project communes.
Child Awareness
Percentage of boys and girls aged 6-8 years who know where to report
Indicator 26
violent incidents involving themselves and other children
Violence against children takes various forms and happens in families, schools and institutions.
It could be violent discipline, psychological aggression, physical punishment, child trafficking,
economic and sexual exploitation or child marriage. Most of the children typically experience
violence at the hands of the people they trust most – their parents or caregivers, teachers,
peers and neighbours. In fact, at global scale, three-quarters of the world’s 2- to 4-year-old
children (around 300 million) are regularly subjected to violent discipline by their caregivers at
home17.
Child discipline with the use of violence in Vietnam remains a high percentage over the years.
Results gathered from the recent MICS survey in 2020 – 2021 show that 70.8 percent of
children aged 1-14 years experienced any physical punishment and/or psychological
aggression by caregivers in the past one month. With violent discipline still a socially accepted
norm, children remain especially vulnerable when they have limited understanding of their
rights to speak out or seek out for help when violence occurs. All children have the right to
protection from violence, regardless of the nature or severity of the act and all forms of violence
can cause harm to children, reduce their sense of self-worth, affront their dignity and hinder
their development.
The concentration on awareness-raising among children aged 6-8 has been put within the
scope of the IECD programme in the effort to put violence against children to an end. The
primary aim is to provide 6-to-8-year-old children the knowledge of how to seek assistance in
preventing violent incidents involving themselves and other children. In order to capture a
general picture of the impact of this intervention, the endline household survey also asked
17 UNICEF. (2017). Worldwide 300 million children suffer from violent methods of upbringing.
<https://www.unicef.org/kyrgyzstan/press-releases/child-suffer-violent-methods-upbringing>

children aged 6-8 where and to whom they would report in case of being exposed to violent
actions to compare with the baseline values. The research team has committed in the ethical
consideration process that consent from both the children and their caregivers were obtained
as a mandatory requirement prior to the interview with children. During the implementation of
the interview process, we also took numerous UN and UNICEF’s guidelines and standards
into consideration as specified in the UNEG Norms and Standards for Evaluation (2016),
UNICEF’s revised Evaluation Policy (2018) and UNEG Ethical Guidelines for Evaluation
(2020).
For the sensitive questions related to violent acts, enumerators asked for permission to
interview children without the involvement of their parents or caregivers to avoid children’s
pressure because in some cases, these acts may come from the family members. In fact, from
the research team’s experience from baseline evaluation, ethnic minority children often feel
shy when talking to strangers and need their parents to stay beside them during the interview.
In addition, our enumerators in a commune of Dien Bien Dong missed the opportunity to meet
the children in person since they had to stay at school for quarantine and their primary
caregivers would answer on their behalf. In other districts and provinces under normal context,
the team took the best effort to restrict these “answer-on-behalf” cases for the better reflection
of children’s awareness.
Overall, the survey results show a slight reduction of 0.2 per cent in the percentage of
children aged 6-8 years who claimed that they would report violent incidents involving
themselves and other children compared to the baseline. However, there is a remarkable
sign that this figure tends to increase over three years for those who would report incidents
involving themselves only. Among three project provinces, Dien Bien experienced
approximately 10 per cent decline, while a much higher rate of 6-to-8-year-old boys and girls
who could point out where to inform if getting attacked physically and verbally than in baseline
has been recorded in Gia Lai and Kon Tum. For the situation in Dien Bien, some “answer-on-
behalf” cases in Dien Bien Dong due to Covid-19 impacts as mentioned above could become
a potential confounding factor causing the 10% decrease at the endline.

Regarding the person to whom children would inform the violent incidents, a majority of them
(equivalent to 47.4%) chose their parents. The respective figures for “teachers” and
“relatives/adult family members” were 26% and 9%. Meanwhile, almost no progress has been
made regarding the popularity of the child protection committee among children, evidenced by
the fact that nearly none of the surveyed children would think about reporting violent incidents
to child protection officers.

When disaggregated by the children’s relationship with primary caregivers, there is a similar
trend with baseline in terms of the variation of their source of support. To be specific, children
76
having grandparents as their primary caregivers are less likely to ask their parents or other
adult family members for help when being in troubles. Instead, more than 60% of the children
decided to tell their teachers at school.

Non-violent child discipline practice

Indicator 17 locations who believed that responsive and non-violent parenting is
their best for their children
Physical and psychological punishment of children is not a strange or unusual phenomenon.
It is part of everyday life in most countries, across most cultures, including Vietnam. It is so
normalized that even professionals working with children may not perceive it to be violence
(Save the Children, 2008, p.2). Although many studies have pointed to the wide-ranging and
long-lasting negative effects of violent discipline practices, for example poorer learning
outcomes, and compromised physical and emotional health (UNICEF, 2020, p.14), the
problem of violent discipline is still prevalent in Vietnam, especially in more rural, poor areas
where parents lack access to information and guidance on appropriate parenting methods.
To tackle this problem, a significant part of the UNICEF’s Nobody’s Perfect Parenting
programme was dedicated to increasing parent and caregivers’ knowledge and capabilities to
promote responsive caregiving and use of positive parenting techniques and non-violent
discipline strategies to create a nurturing, non-violent and safe home settings for children to
be able to develop to their full potentials.
To assess the changes in parents’ knowledge regarding child discipline after the programme
implementation, the research team asked parents or caregivers of children aged 0-8 in the
three project provinces whether children should be disciplined by violent practices or not. The
results show that the percentage of parents/caregivers who believe that responsive and
non-violent parenting is the best for their children increased in all three provinces, by
10.5 percentage point in total. Out of the three project provinces, parents/caregivers in Dien
77
Bien seemed to have acquired the most significant change in knowledge, with an increase of
17.5 percentage point for this indicator.

Remarkably, the improvement in parents/caregivers’ awareness on violent discipline
methods was found most significant in the poorest household group. Specifically, the
percentage of parents/caregivers who believe in any violent discipline method decreased by
20.7 percentage point, from 77.5% in the baseline to 56.8% in the endline survey, for the lowest
Wealth Index Quintile group (Figure 48). This suggests that UNICEF’s activities have reached
out and helped reducing the knowledge gap for the poorest beneficiaries, who often have the
most limited access to information and guidance on updated, progressive child rearing
practices.

Indicator 19 project locations who practise non-violent discipline and responsive
parenting
By raising parents’ awareness and equipping them with knowledge on the importance and the
methods of non-violent discipline and responsive parenting, the UNICEF’s Nobody’s Perfect
Parenting programme aims to ultimately improve the parents/caregivers’ practices in child
rearing at their own homes.
Similar to the baseline, in the endline, the research team used a series of questions on the
methods which adults in the households used to discipline a selected child during the past
month to investigate information related to the practise of non-violence disciplinary with
children. The surveyed discipline methods include both psychological aggression discipline
(shout/yell/scream at the child; call them dumb, lazy or any similar names) and physical
punishments (grab and shake the child; spank, hit or slap on the bottom; hit the child with some
objects).
The results show that along with the improvement in knowledge about non-violent parenting,
the percentage of parents/caregivers who reported practising responsive parenting and
non-violent discipline also increased by 8.8 percentage points in total in the three
provinces. Across the UNICEF-supported areas, Dien Bien again saw the highest percentage
point in the proportion of parents/ primary caregivers who put non-violent and responsive
parenting knowledge into practice. Particularly, Kon Tum and Gia Lai provinces observed a
significant improvement in the practice of non-violent discipline, which demonstrated a double
and triple in figure.

Since I attended the training [Nobody’s Perfect Parenting Programme], I learned to contain
my anger from other mothers. When I feel too angry with my children, I leave the place for
about 5-10 minutes and only return to talk to my children when I have calmed down. By
then my children also have calmed down and can listen to me explaning what they did
wrong. If I am wrong then I will admit it to them and change myself. I try to treat my children
like I am their friend.

The improvement in parents/caregivers’ discipline practices towards their children was
found more significant in the parents/caregivers with lower educational levels than their
counterparts (Figure 50). In the baseline, the percentage of parents/caregiver with high
school and over education levels who practised non-violent discipline was the highest at
19.3%, leaving quite a gap with their counterparts who only finished secondary school or lower.
However, at the endline, there was significant increase of the proportion of parents/caregivers
practising non-violent discipline in the latter groups, specifically by 9, 10.1, and 11.8
percentage points for parents/caregivers with pre-primary or none, primary, and secondary
school levels respectively. Thus, this shows that the gap in good child discipline practices
amongst parents of different educational levels has reduced remarkably from the baseline to
the endline of the programme.

Access to media materials can help parents and primary caregivers learn more information
about ECD, as well as support for the care and feeding process. In this survey, the team
investigated whether parents of children aged 0-8 in the project area received media materials
or learned their own information about ECD. This information was collected to assess the
primary care provider's access to early childhood development information.
Survey results show that the percentage of parents and caregivers of children aged 0-8
years in project locations receiving ECD-related communication materials has doubled
since baseline (42.9% compared to 20.6%) (see Error! Reference source not found.).
Particularly, among three project provinces, Kon Tum recorded the highest percentage of
parents receiving ECD-related communication materials (53%), followed by Dien Bien and Gia

By wealth index quintiles, despite some improvements compared to the baseline, there is a
noticeable gap between the poorest household group (23.3%) and the richest household
group (59.9%), more than 30 percentage points in the endline (see Figure 52). This can be
explained by the fact that richer households have more access to information than poorer
households. Similarly, the households, in which primary caregivers have a higher
education level, tend to access more information. Among ethnic groups, Thai (68.2%),
Kinh (51.9%) and Gie Trieng (55.7%) households are more likely to be aware of ECD-related
communication materials than other ethnic minority groups (under 50%). Besides, the research
team also assessed “Other ethnic groups” as the sample size of this group is relatively small.
The ownership of items such as radio/cassette, computer, Internet, telephone, and access to
ward loudspeaker could also affect households’ access to information. The survey indicates
that Kinh households owned more durable goods, including the above-mentioned items, more
than other ethnic minority households. When it comes to information sources, service
providers were most likely to be approached by parents or primary caregivers (94.4%).
Specifically, service providers include doctors at health centers/hospitals, commune and
village health staff, teachers in nursery/kindergarten/primary schools, and other
communes/village staff. The second most popular source of information is media (50.3
%), followed by relatives or friends (44.5%) and reading materials (19.8%). The mass media
includes Internet, television, radio, and ward loudspeaker systems.

Percentage of parents and caregivers of children aged 0-8 years who
Indicator 29 know and can list the benefits of all areas of IECD and know where to
find supports
For this indicator, the research team evaluated whether parents or primary caregivers know
the benefits of IECD and the place(s) to seek supports on IECD services. In particular, the
IECD areas covered in this indicator at endline were (1) age-appropriate medical care for
children and (2) integrated education about physical activities, communication, and social
emotion. For each area, survey respondents (parents/ primary caregivers) were asked to list
as many benefits as they could; and where they would go to receive assistance.
The endline results, illustrated in Figure 53, show that 56% of interviewed parents or
caregivers of children aged 0-8 years understand the benefits of IECD aspects and know
where to find supports, which rose by 9% since baseline (47%). If divided by project
provinces, Dien Bien recorded the most significant improvement (66%), which was the result
of a 1.5-time-increase compared to its baseline achievement. Standing at the second place,
57.5% of interviewed parents or caregivers in Kon Tum could list the benefits of IECD aspects
and know where to find support. However, despite quite a good start at baseline, Gia Lai saw
the lowest percentage (40.1%) among the three focus provinces.

Remarkably, a marked correlation is observed between primary caregivers’ listing IECD
benefits and other demographic characteristics (Figure 54). By wealth index quintiles, 33.5
percent of the poorest groups could list the benefits and find support, then it increased in other
groups, up to around 70 percent in the second and richest groups. A similar pattern is also
witnessed with primary caregivers’ education level. Particularly, at primary education or lower,
about 40-50 percent of parents or primary caregivers could list the benefits and find support,
while at secondary education, high school, and higher, this rate reached 64 percent and 80
percent, respectively. When it comes to surveyed ethnic groups, a difference also exists. Thai,
Gie Trieng and Kinh groups are among the top 3 groups recording over 60 percent. Meanwhile,
Gia Rai and Ba Na groups got the lowest rate, under 45 percent. The gap among the above
mentioned ethnic groups can be explained by the differences in households’ wealth, education
level and Vietnamese fluency.

4.9 IECD Perception
Percentage of parents/caregivers who believe that all children at the
Indicator 30 right age, regardless of background and abilities, should receive IECD
services, equally
One of the key goals of the IECD programme is to ensure all children have equitable access
to essential and quality child survival and development packages. Indicator 30 therefore serves
the purposes of assessing if such goal can be nurtured from the grass-root level. The
85
quantitative endline survey aims to explore parents’ and primary caregivers’ beliefs by asking
their actual practices such as giving children enough periodic health checks and vaccination
according to age; providing children with enough meals and adequate nutrition per meal as
guided by a doctor, health care worker or teacher; and registering (or plan to register) schooling
for children at the right age. The rationale employed here is that if a child is fully involved in
activities like periodic health checks, age-appropriate vaccination, in-time school enrolment, it
reflects the parents/primary caregivers’ belief in those IECD services. On the contrary, if a child
is not offered with any of the listed benefits/activities by parents/primary caregivers, the
evaluation team wants to know whether that comes from objective (availability/access
to/quality of services) or subjective (perception-related) reasons.
Overall, nearly all surveyed parents in the endline assessment (98%) supported equal
rights of children to IECD services, among whom 47% were capable of providing all three
essential services to their children and 51% could not let their children enjoy IECD services
even though they believe in them. Remarkably, by the time of the endline assessment, only
2% of respondents failed to offer IECD services to their children because of subjective reasons
(disbelief), which reflects a considerable growth from baseline (13%). There is no major
differences in IECD perception across three provinces at endline but Dien Bien recorded the
most pronounced improvement compared to three years ago (Figure 55).

When disaggregated by IECD services, most parents/primary caregivers failed at “adequate
nutrition instructed by health workers/teachers”. As can be seen from the below figure, financial
resources remained the most prominent obstacle but it seemed to affect households in endline
more severely than in baseline. However, since this reason is categorized as objective reasons
(together with reason 1, 3, and 7), it symbolizes a challenge to equality rather than
respondents’ belief in equitable IECD services for all children. On a positive note, subjective
reasons (4 & 5), which strongly dictate one’s understanding of fair enjoyment of services,
underwent a large decrease compared to baseline.

4.10 Peace Building and Social Cohesion
The IECD programme emphasizes the contribution of ECD services to horizontal and vertical
social cohesion, specifically to strengthen interpersonal relations between individuals and
intergroup relations in the community. The baseline assessment explored the collaboration of
individuals and groups in the community in ECD, measured by their level of participation in
ECD activities such as sharing useful information and giving advice about how to educate and
take care of children.
To measure horizontal social cohesion, in the household survey, the endline assessment
asked the primary caregivers if (i) they would share to community people useful information
about how to educate and take care of children and (ii) they felt supported by community
people in case of having difficulties in raising children. In term of vertical social cohesion which
refers to the relationship between individuals and families with authorities, the endline
assessment did ask primary caregivers if they regularly received information about how to raise
children from ECD service providers including schools, health centers and other officers.
As shown in Figure 57, overall, there is a slight improvement in the endline proportion of
primary caregivers who responded that they were willing to share useful information to people
in the community about how to educate and take care of children (nearly 85 percent),
compared to the baseline result (79.5 percent).

Across three provinces, there are no major differences in primary caregivers’ willingness and
activeness to share information. Besides, the percentage does not vary much between
different ethnic groups (Figure 58). However, the percentage increased as the educational
level of primary caregivers and household wealth improved, implied that caregivers attaining
higher education level and household prosperity were more open to the community and more
willing to share useful childcare tips.

In brief, results of horizontal social cohesion indicate that the interpersonal and inter-group
relationships in the community were likely to depend on the educational level of primary
caregivers and their household wealth.
A modest improvement was witnessed in the proportion of primary caregivers who responded
“Yes” when being asked if that they “regularly receive information about raising children from
service providers” (Figure 61Error! Reference source not found.). Particularly, 73.4 percent
of primary caregivers responded “Yes” in the endline, a rise of nearly 10 percentage points
compared to the baseline. Among three provinces, Gia Lai recorded the lowest percentage.
Comparing primary caregivers from different ethnic groups, Gia Rai, H’Mong and Xo Dang
were least likely to report “regularly receive information about raising children from service
providers” (Figure 62).

Obviously, primary caregivers are more likely to ask questions or make suggestions on
childcare and education than they did in the baseline (see Figure 63). It is remarked that Gia
Lai saw a slight drop in the percentage of primary caregivers asking or suggesting, compared
to the baseline. This province also recorded the lowest proportion (34.2 per cent), across three
provinces. When categorised by population subgroups, the result shows that better educated
and wealthier caregivers more often asked questions or made suggestions regarding child
care and child education to community people and service providers.

In lieu, the research team came up with a similar finding to questions about horizontal social

wealthier caregivers were more likely to respond “Yes”.
4.11 Access to and use of IECD services
Indicator 5 Number of communes having functioning IECD services
A commune is qualified as having functioning IECD services if it meets all of the following
criteria:
➢ Effective IECD programme implementation: having an IECD programme steering
committee; having an IECD club with weekly activity; having a network of IECD core
staff at village level; having a child protection committee.
92
➢ Effective provision of healthcare, nutrition & WASH services in commune health
centres: post-natal care within the first month of delivery for both mother and baby;
new-born care at home by skilled birth attendants; exclusive breast feeding, IYCF and
micronutrient supplementation, community-led total sanitation, hygiene promotion.
➢ Effective provision of early education services & WASH services in pre-schools: WASH
in schools focusing on handwashing; having early learning centres both formal and
community based.
At the baseline, no surveyed commune was found to be qualified for having functioning IECD
services according to the above criteria, mostly because of the lack of effective IECD
programme implementation. By the time of the endline, there were a total of two communes
qualified as having functioning IECD services. However, the research team observed that to
meet the first criterion, i.e. having effective IECD programme implementation, the original
conditions required the commune to have an IECD club that held at least 4 meetings in the last
month at the time of the endline survey (i.e. in the commune questionnaire, answer to IECD.5b
>=4). Since the Covid situation in Vietnam has been critical since July 2021 with restrictions
being placed in different locations including the project areas, gathering of more than 10 people
was not allowed in some locations, making it difficult for communes to meet this condition.
Thus, the research team decided to revise this condition, which only requires communes’ IECD
clubs to have held at least one meeting since establishment (IECD.5a >=1). With the revised
condition, 15 communes were found to meet the first criterion of effective IECD programme
implementation, making a total of 10 communes satisfied the criteria for having
functioning IECD services (Figure 64). Those communes are: Na Tong (Tuan Giao, Dien
Bien), Dak Glei town, Dak Choong (Dak Glei, Kon Tum), Dak To Re (Kon Ray, Kon Tum), Dak
Ro Ong (Tu Mo Rong, Kon Tum), Kong Chieng, Dak Troi (Mang Yang, Gia Lai), Chu Drang
(Krong Pa, Gia Lai).

intervention package targeting 0 to 35 month-old children
Being one of UNICEF’s Results Assessment Module (RAM) standard indicators relevant for
ECD, this indicator aims to capture the progress in a country towards establishing an integrated
ECD approach to address the critical first three years of life through a packaged intervention
of early stimulation, protection and nutrition. Accordingly countries are classified into one of
the five (5) categories.

• Early stimulation, protection, and nutrition interventions are packaged and adopted by
the government as a national model, and started rolling out under the government
Championing
ownership
(score 5)
As the baseline results showed, in the project locations all interventions aimed at young
children aged 0-3 were primarily delivered through the health system, in particular by the
commune health centre. As a consequence of the sole involvement of the health system in
providing the package, the interventions were mostly childcare-related, including stimulation
and nutrition.The protection component was delivered separately by the commune’s Child
Protection officials and targeted the older age-groups, from 3 years old and above. In addition,
the Vietnam government has not yet adopted the ECD package as a nation-wide model. For
those reasons, by the time of the endline, no project communes were qualified for Score 4
(Established) or 5 (Championing) yet.
To meet the criteria for Score 3 (Developing), the communes have to have health centers
providing both stimulation and nutrition services, and have an established ECD coordinating
committee to implement these services in a programmatic way. Accordingly, at the endline,
20 out of 24 surveyed project communes (excluding 3 communes in Gia Lai) were found
to meet Score 3 - having at least two interventions of early stimulation, protection, and
nutrition programmatically coordinated to improve the child development outcome of
the targeted population of 0-35 months old children. The remaining four communes,
namely Ta Phin, Chieng So (Dien Bien), Dak Rve and Tan Lap (Kon Tum), met Score 2
(Initiating) since in those communes, although the ECD coordinating committees were in place,
the health centers were only providing either stimulation or nutrition intervention.
Proportion of ECD centers that provide integrated ECD services based
Indicator 12
on national standards
ECD centres, namely preschools, play an important role in providing a foundation for the
physical and cognitive development of children aged 0-6. This indicator demonstrates the
proportion of surveyed preschools in the project areas which have achieved National Standard
95
level 1 or 2 recognition during the last 5 years. National Standard level 1 specifies that
preschools have childcare and education activities, which ensure comprehensive quality
education in compliance with the goals of preschool education. Level 2 requires some other
criteria in addition to level 1’s, such as school attendance, school lunch provision, proportion
of children with normal growth in weight and height by age.
The survey results showed that the proportion of ECD centres that provide integrated ECD
services meeting national standards level 1 or 2 increased considerably from 17.9% in
the baseline to 44.4% at the time of the endline in the project provinces (Figure 66). Gia
Lai is the province which witnessed the most significant improvement, from having none of the
six surveyed preschools meeting national standards three years ago to having four (accounting
for 66.7%) in 2021. Dien Bien and Kon Tum each achieved an increase of two and one
preschools meeting national standards respectively.

Indicator 33
provincial, project districts and communes
At the time of baseline evaluation, the IECD Project Management Unit (PMU) Committee
was established from provincial and district level to commune level in all three
provinces at different times in 2018. In order to effectively facilitate the project activities, a
multi-sectoral mechanism of operationalization model at all levels has been built during the
implementation period.
96
Figure 67. The structure of the operationalisation model at all levels
Source: Operationalisation model for implementing IECD activities at subnational level, UNICEF
Mechanism for multi-sectoral collaboration represented by:
i) An effective programme management unit (PMU) maintains statutory governance and
programme oversight on integrated early childhood development (IECD)
implementation in each province and project communes;
ii) A model commune operationalization guideline is in place that guides the work of
different groups involved, and facilitates effective linkages between the different service
components of IECD involved;
iii) Regular micro planning/coordination meetings are conducted monthly in all project
communes, ensuring cross-sector collaboration for delivery of IECD essential services
to targeted women and children at grassroots level;
iv) A cross sector joint monitoring field trip that helps ensure undesired practices of
sectoral interventions and services are identified and corrected in a timely manner.
In each provincial PMU, there has been the representation of members from key sectoral
departments and agencies, including Department of Health (DOH), Department of Education
and Training (DOET), Department of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs (DOLISA), and other
relevant stakeholders, which contributed to the greater coordination among project
components. The main responsibility of a provincial PMU is to facilitate, oversee, expedite,
monitor and evaluate the implementation process and to report on project activities. Besides,
a District programme team was formed for each of the project districts under the guidance of
the provincial PMU as a focal point to enhance the coordination between PMU at province and
communes.
At commune level, a Project Management Group (PMG) was established under the guidance
of a leader from Commune People’s Committee. The group’s composition involves multi-
sectoral participation of technical staffs in child protection, healthcare, education sectors and
for the Women’s Union. The communal PMG plays a central role in implementing IECD
activities taking place at commune level in a connected and integrated manner. There was
97
also the IECD team established in all project villages, constituting a network of core staff at
grassroots level (ex. village heads, village health worker, child protection collaborators, local
teachers, etc.). Their duties were mainly to implement the communication activities, deliver
consultation services, provide care and support, initiate changes in holistic ECD perception
and skills, and to spread IECD in the community and households. Results taken from the
commune survey indicated that 2 communes Chu Gu (Gia Lai) and Hang Lia (Dien Bien) have
not set up a network of core staffs at village level yet. Among communes having village staffs,
only 2 communes have recorded the network expanded while around 32 per cent of these
communes observed the reduction in the number of staffs since September 2018. It seemed
that the operationalization of the communal and village team was not effective as expected
due to the insufficiency of consistent system and supporting funds for worker-in-charge.
“
[…] In the program’s operationalization structure, only PMU at provincial level has a well-
constructed model, while in districts, communes and villages, the leaders are appointed to be
the focal point. The lack of a consistent and integrated system really became major hindrance
during the implementation process. In addition, without the receipt of monthly allowance within
the project, the person-in-charge at communal and village level would work under low efficiency
and drop out of their jobs.
KII with Vice Director of Department of Health, Dien Bien.
As of November 2021, 19 out of 24 surveyed communes have still maintained the activities
within IECD clubs. Among 5 communes reported to cease organizing these clubs, there are
up to 4 communes in Dien Bien province, namely Ta Phin, Xin Chai, Ta Sin Thang (Tua Chua
district) and Pu Nhi commune (Dien Bien Dong district). Even though all three provinces have
not been significantly impacted during the Covid-19 pandemic in comparison with other
provinces nationwide, the restriction on public gathering in 2020 has disrupted the clubs’
activities as well as the fieldwork of UNICEF experts. For the adaptation in the context of Covid-
19, the means of multi-stakeholder communication and coordination has already switched to
online platforms (ex. Zalo, Facebook). Despite their great efforts to overcome these
challenges, communal staffs still face many difficulties in supporting service provision and
communication with beneficiaries, particularly those in remote areas.
“
[… in the context of Covid-19 outbreak] The communication to the beneficiary caregivers
became limited since not all of them own a smart phone.

According to the baseline evaluation report, all three provinces Dien Bien, Kon Tum and
Gia Lai have mapped out the Action Plan for the whole programme period of 2018-2021
which set out the annual roadmap with budget allocation to each executing partner in response
to the provincial project’s immediate objectives. In the early of 2020, the two-year 2020 and
2021 provincial’s Annual Work Plan for IECD was developed and adopted in a participatory
manner by UNICEF and the provincial governments. This document synthesized the achieved
outcomes from the previous implementing period and plan for 2020-2021 period, specifically:
In 2017, the project focused on the project preparation and approval procedures.
In 2018, the project officially kicked off and implemented activities, emphasizing on the
establishment of an IECD governance and coordination system in districts, communes and
villages, capacity building for IECD service providers, IECD awareness-raising in
communities and application of mobile technology (m-IECD) to track the implementation
progress in project locations.
In 2019, the project focused on building capacity for IECD service providers and raising
awareness and practice of IECD in communities through effective IECD services and
models.
In 2020-2021 period, the project continued to provide services and equipment with the
application of m-IECD, digital technology, indicators to track and evaluate the
implementation process, create favourable environment and conditions to deploy the
intervention of IECD in districts and communes to achieve the set targets.
At the time of interview, all three provinces have been in the progress of evaluating the end-
of-programme achievements of outcomes.
Existence of a monitoring system for tracking the progress of the IECD
Indicator 35
models implementation
From the initial design, the IECD programme adopted the result-based management approach
in combination with a number of M&E tools (sectoral and government surveys, case studies,
situation analysis, period review and field visit and independent assessment). At the time of
endline evaluation, all three provinces have finished the implementation of a monitoring
system. For tracking the implementation progress, a quarterly reporting activity was created
and applied in all 27 programme communes. The report covers key and simple indicators that
allow the programme to track implementation status in communes, especially tracking key
results achieved by the community, such as number of group communication sessions
conducted, number of parent/child caregivers participating in the ECD sessions, or essential
ECD services coverages among targeted beneficiaries.
To be specific, relevant departments at provincial level being in charge of each IECD
component held monthly or quarterly briefings to strengthen the coordination and discussion
of work related to children. It was also reported that each department organized inter-sectoral
supervision of its specific responsibilities mentioned in relevant provincial decisions. Moreover,
DOLISA Dien Bien has developed a database system of children, which has been regularly
and promptly updated in the Children Monitoring Book. The province aimed to update
children’s information into the Children Management software according to the regulations of
99
the MOLISA. Additionally, provincial PMU representatives reported to receive UNICEF’s
support in the form of technical training and periodic supervision through field visits for the
programme’s evaluation.
At the grassroots level, the internal meetings were frequently conducted with the participation
of members in provincial and district PMU Board, which is not only to monitor the
implementation of project activities but also to provide support for the communal officials in
work plan development. Besides, the commune questionnaire explores the current status of
IECD programme steering committee’s meetings in terms of frequency and format. The final
results showed that most of these meetings had been conducted monthly, but some
communes in Dien Bien organized the meeting quarterly or had to switch to quarterly due to
the Covid-19’s impacts. The meetings have mainly taken place directly and only Chieng So
commune (Dien Bien) and Dak Rve Town (Kon Tum) have recently changed the meetings via
online platforms. The most significant improvement in the monitoring system should refer to
the fact that all communes have reported the programme progress periodically. The
achievement of result was consolidated and submitted in document, generally on a monthly or
quarterly basis.
“
[…] The main purpose of briefing meeting in the commune is to oversee the progress in case
management and how the case managers provide supporting interventions for the children in
need. In addition, we are also willing to support the child protection workers in developing the
annual, quarterly and even monthly workplan, and other relevant tasks such as intervention
plan for children being abuse or neglect.

Findings on the key evaluation questions
The effectiveness of the IECD programme is evaluated based on the extent to which the
program has achieved targets and results set out in the programme design. More explicitly,
questions of effectiveness include:
➢ Has the Programme achieved the targets and results set out in the programme design
at the outset?
➢ What is the governance structure of the programme and how effective this structure
was for service delivering, coordination, and collaboration?
➢ How did COVID-19 pandemic affect the programme implementation, progress and
achievement of results?
Overall, the research team assess the programme’s effectiveness as “Satisfactory” with
reasons explained below:
102
1. Has the Programme achieved the targets and results set out in the programme
design at the outset?
Summary response: Yes. In six areas of focus, namely Child health, Education, Child
protection, Peace building and social cohesion, Access to and use of IECD services and
Implementation of IECD programme, the programme achieves an improvement in 31 out
of 33 indicators, except for the decline in the percentage of local health workers able to
perform IYCF counselling and the decline in the percentage of boys and girls aged 6-8 years
who know where to report violent incidents involving themselves and other children. The
decrease in the percentage of IYCF counselling-capable health workers is attributed to the
reduced training rate, which comes from the fact that (1) not every health worker in the center
received IYCF training; and (2) in the year 2021, under the COVID-19’s pandemic impact, no
IYCF training has been conducted.
When asked to self-evaluate the usefulness of the programme to the communes, the majority
of respondents in the service provider survey rate as quite useful and very useful. This
confirms the effectiveness of the IECD model delivered in the project locations.

There has been improvement in both quantity and quality of ECD centres/ programmes
for children. 100 per cent of ECE centres, including family-based childcare groups in the three
project provinces are found to have minimum IECD equipment. 81.5 per cent of ECE centres
provide all four early learning/ stimulation services, namely parent counselling, early
stimulation, social and emotional learning and positive discipline.
Vulnerable and marginalized children benefit from the IECD programme in different
ways. For example, in Dien Bien province, 9 models managing disadvantaged children are
established in project communes. In the whole province, a total number of 2,760
disadvantaged children (including orphans, marginalized children and COVID-19-impacted
children) are entitled to social assistance. More than 3,000 children in SOS villages and social
assistance centres are subject to case management and receive skills development.
103
There has been improvement in parents/ caregivers’ attitudes and practices of positive
discipline in households. Percentage of parents/ caregivers who engaged with their children
aged 0-4 years (under 5) in activities to promote responsive care including early stimulation
increases from 56.8 per cent to 59.8 per cent. 100 per cent of project districts and project
communes are committed to protecting children from violence, abuse and neglect and already
established child protection committees at the district and commune level.
However, even though there has been improvement in some indicators’ performance, the
improvement is not sufficient to reach the target. The percentage of people in humanitarian
situations who access safe drinking water increases from 30.1 per cent to 49.4 per cent, but
the target rate for the whole programme area is 100 per cent. Also, the proportion of population
having an improved sanitation facility grows from 26.2 per cent to 46 per cent, against the
target rate of 100 per cent for the whole programme area. Also, the percentage of
parents/caregivers who practice responsive parenting and non-violent discipline is 11.4 per
cent, against the target rate of 50 per cent.
Also, climate change and natural disasters are a hindrance to the programme’s
implementation. In 2019, there was a devastating flood that affected a wide area, including
Gia Lai and Kon Tum province. Climate change and natural disasters put people’s lives in
jeopardy, thus slowing down the programme’s progress.
Language barriers and gender stereotypes are a hindrance to the programme’s
achievement of results. Language barriers and the lack of communication materials in ethnic
languages make it hard for parents/ caregivers to comprehend the training content. Even
though fathers are more literate than mothers, the perception that childcare is mothers’ duties
discourage fathers from participating in the training and club meetings. In such meetings, the
majority of participants are mothers.
2. What is the governance structure of the programme and how effective this structure
was for service delivering, coordination, and collaboration?
Summary response: Yes, effective. At the central level, the IECD programme has created a
clear working structure and well-shaped coordination mechanism. Previously, there was no
central-level agency assigned to be in charge of IECD. In October 2018 MOLISA was assigned
to develop the IECD programme with the participation of MOH and MOET, under Decision
no.1437. The decision is a legal and strategic document that serves as basis for ministries and
agencies to work together in programme implementation.
Technically, the Government has adopted a mandatory inter-ministerial circular on inter-
sectoral cooperation on IECD. The collaboration in technical assistance is good because all
the techniques introduced to the local areas have the central government’s imprint. Compared
with the baseline, the linkages between stakeholders are strong in the sense that the central
government provides technical support to the local government and the local government, in
return, reviews and provides the central government with evidence of the interventions’
effectiveness.
At the local level, in the 2017-2021 period, interdisciplinary cooperation has been professional
and intensive on the principle of optimizing children’s development. The coordination is shown
in the development of the draft programme, implementation of action plans and annual plans
104
as well as monitoring and supervision. For example, a monitoring activity can be joined by
more than one sector. The donor’s field visits are attended by representatives of all sectors.
In all project districts and project communes, coordination committee and mechanism on IECD
are available. In 20 out of 24 communes, at least two interventions of early stimulation,
protection and nutrition are programmatically coordinated to improve the child development
outcome of the targeted population of 0-35 month olds. There is cross-sectoral collaboration
in progress tracking of IECD models in each province.
There has also been an increase in counterpart funding and its share in total approved budget.
Counterpart funding of three provinces increases from USD 151,124 (2018) to USD 200,090
(2020-2021). The share of counterpart funding in total approved budget (of three provinces)
increases from 6.3 per cent to 11.5 per cent.
3. How did COVID-19 pandemic affect the programme implementation, progress and
achievement of results?
Summary response: COVID-19 pandemic seriously impacts programme implementation and
achievement of results.
The pandemic increases the programme staff’s workload, hence their dedication to IECD
programme is affected. Particularly in the Healthcare sector, the focus was on pandemic
control and prevention and healthcare staff did the extra tasks of testing and tracing COVID-
19 patients. Also, the pandemic has switched the provincial budget for communication from
IECD programme to pandemic prevention. As a result, the provincial budget for IECD
programme has been reduced.
Due to social distancing order, almost all programme activities have been switched from offline
to online. For communication, indirect communication through loudspeakers and written
materials is not as effective as home visits and direct communication. Furthermore, in Muong
Mun commune (Dien Bien province) where 2 out of 12 villages do not have electricity,
communication through loudspeakers does not work.
The pandemic makes people more cautious when accessing healthcare services for fear of
infection. Therefore, the healthcare staff has to make home visits to distribute multi-
micronutrient packages. Activities such as prenatal check-ups and providing iron pills for
pregnant women are interrupted. Home counseling for the most vulnerable groups of children
are also very limited.

Findings on the evaluation questions
The efficiency of the IECD programme is defined as the extent to which the programme has
optimized its resources and input throughout the programme cycle. More explicitly, questions
of efficiency include:
➢ How economically resources or inputs (such as budget, expertise and time) are
converted to results?
➢ Did the programme manage to achieve all or some of its objectives within established
timeframes and costs?
➢ Did the programme demonstrate some flexibility in adapting to any change in
environment in terms of political, legal or socio-economic aspects?
Overall, the programme’s efficiency is ranked as “Moderately Satisfactory” by the research
team for the following reasons:
1. How economically resources or inputs (such as budget, expertise and time) are
converted to results?
Summary response: Project implementation is as cost-effective as originally proposed. There
was a timely and stable release of counterpart funds as committed by project provinces, which
is very instrumental for local actors to run the desired activities. Three provinces also managed
to achieve improvement in at least two thirds of the quantitative indicators.
• The cost-sharing policy between the donor (UNICEF) and the recipients (project
provinces) is considered relevant and effective in ensuring compliance and delivery of
operations, as mutually agreed by stakeholders. The counterpart fund was mainly used
for regular expenses during operations of PMU and local collaborators (staff
remuneration, meeting location, means of transportation for officers on duty, other
working conditions, …).
106
According to the opinions of provincial governments, the cost-sharing is vitally
important as it demonstrates mutual trust between the two parties (donor – recipient)
and reflect the commitment of the local authority during programme implementation.
• Generally, all three provinces achieve a high disbursement rate, at higher than 90
per cent, which implies that almost all project activities are delivered, and associated
expenses are disbursed according to the plan.
• Three provinces manage to achieve improvement in at least two thirds of the
quantitative indicators within the established timeframes and costs. The key
costs, however, vary across provinces.

Summary response: Partially yes. The financial resource is not sufficient to achieve all
objectives set in the originally planned vision, which was more ambitious. However, despite

funding constraints, financial resources were utilized as efficiently as possible, resulting in the
achievement of most important objectives.
“
According to the approved plan, UNICEF’s total resources are more than 3 million USD
(both readily available sources and mobilized sources). However, in reality, the program
only received more than 26 billion VND (roughly 1.1 million USD), which is 52% of the
planned budget. Despite that, the program still managed to reach more than 80% of its
objectives. The counterpart funds for operational management were also guaranteed
100% as intial commitment.

• The funding constraints lead to modifications of some activities and add complexity to
the implementation process.

Financial resources from the local government did increase compared to previous years
but still not adequate to achieve all targets.

3. Did the programme demonstrate some flexibility in adapting to any change in
environment in terms of political, legal or socio-economic aspects?
Summary response: Yes, the programme did demonstrate certain level of flexibility to adapt to
environmental changes such as Covid-19 pandemic. However, resource mobilization was not
as successful as expected so there is not much of flexibility in adjusting the programme to
adapt to socio-economic trends and emerging needs of people.
“
The only disadvantage is the lack of funds in reality compared to the design. We had to
cut down on some activities related to communication materials for dissemination of
project results (developing booklets, documents, handbook for public release) in order to
prioritize other important activities
KII with PMU Kon Tum.
• During the social distancing period due to Covid-19, the delivery of key programme
messages changed from club activities to using local loud speaker system in all 27
project communes. The radio messages were designed in Vietnamese and the local
languages.
108
At the outbreak of the fourth Covid wave, UNICEF responded quickly and invested in
digital equipment for PMU and provincial partners to conduct online meetings/training
so that the frequent operational activities were not interrupted abruptly.
• However, budget planning was strictly followed with limited space for incurred costs.
Resource mobilization was not as successful as expected so there is not much of a
flexibility in adjusting the programme to adapt to socio-economic trends and emerging
needs of people.
For example, despite attempts to take a high-tech approach in reaching the most
vulnerable children in remote areas, UNICEF could not deploy the mobile technology
tracking system called Mobile Integrated Early Childhood Development (MIECD)22 in
27 project communes due the substantial amount of additional budget required.
• Funding opportunities are not equal between components. Some have generous
funding (EENC, Holistic parenting) but the budget belonging to this component could
not be allocated for the other component where funds are in thirsty.

109
The sustainability of the IECD programme is evaluated based on the extent to which the
achieved results and benefits brought about by programme-related interventions are
maintained for an extended period of time after the end of the programme cycle. More explicitly,
the questions of sustainability include:
➢ Are there prospects for further development of related interventions after project’s
completion?
➢ Are local governments in project locations committed and simultaneously capable of
maintaining the IECD operationalization model by the end of the programme cycle?
➢ Do capacity-building activities within the IECD programme positively affect
sustainability?
Overall, the research team assessed the programme’s sustainability as “Satisfactory” with
reasons explained below:
1. Are there prospects for further development of related interventions after project’s
completion?
Summary response: Yes, very likely. Given that the programme was deliberately built upon
local needs and capacities, several core elements inherited from the IECD programme
have been systemized and institutionalized for continuous implementation.
• The nutrition component successfully modelled in three project provinces was officially
formulated as a key Nutrition Benefit Package at MOH and being used to feed
advocacy programme agenda to the National Assembly so as to make that benefit
package to be covered by the National Health Insurance Scheme. The policy advocacy
work is ongoing with promising results and will bring a major sustainable opportunity
for this component’s interventions. In that sense, the provision of micro-nutrient
supplementation for pregnant women and micro-nutrient powder for children aged 6-
23 months old as well as the treatment costs for severely malnourished children will be
sustained in long term, potentially narrowing the health gaps across regions.
• Impacts of the education sector (the Social Emotional Learning (SEL) curriculum, GGA
and ECDS tools) are also very likely to persist as having been nationally adapted by
MOET. Another key factor contributing to increase programme’s sustainability in the
education sector is the fact that a great amount of interventions focuses on capacity
building for teaching staff at both national and subnational levels. .
110
“
[…] For education sector, it is more convenient to prolong as well as replicating the
program’s benefits because we have an advantage that teachers can easily access online
information using technology. After the training, the materials will be shared immediately
through the internal website system or emails so that many schools can apply altogether.
FGD with PMU Dien Bien.
[…] An example of program’s sustainability is our network of education core staff at
provincial level. All of them went through capacity training provided in the IECD program.
They all have good communication skills, curriculum design skills, presentation skills, and
organizing skills. Their knowledge and skills will be sustainable and lasting
FGD with PMU Gia Lai.
• The child protection system at subnational level has been built and strengthened. The
component’s interventions hosted by DOLISA (the Nobody’s Perfect model, case
management for children in special circumstances, …) have been formalized into
national and provincial action plans to be maintained regardless of UNICEF’s support.
For example, as shared by an official from DOLISA Dien Bien in the qualitative
interview, the department has successfully defended the budget for child protection
component (300 million VND) and managed to allocate an addition of 200 million VND
for maintaining and expanding current models in the next phase. Gia Lai and Kon Tum’s
representatives also affirmed with great confidence that the child protection
mechanisms, fortified during the IECD programme, will be able to operate independent
of UNICEF’s involvement.
2. Are local governments in project locations committed and simultaneously capable
of maintaining the IECD operationalization model by the end of the programme
cycle?
Summary response: Yes, a high degree of ownership can be observed in three aspects. First,
the cross-level and cross-sectoral coordination mechanisms are considered a
distinguished element of the IECD programme and have been constantly reinforced throughout
the implementing period23. Second, child related indicators linked to IECD have been
successfully incorporated into provincial SEDP. Last but not least, there exists a genuine
willingness and a continuing commitment of beneficiaries, local governments and service
providers to sustain IECD results in the coming phases.
23 During the UNICEF pilot program, UNICEF IECD mechanism for cross-sectoral collaboration was
reviewed and borrowed by MOLISA to institutionalize that cross collaboration in implementation of the
IECD program. MOLISA and other line ministries formulated an Inter-ministry Circular on cross-sector
collaboration in delivery of IECD service at households and communities. This formulation exercise
completed in 2021 and approved in Feb 2022 by joint MOLISA/MOH/MOET/MOICS which provided a
fundamental for program sustainability.
111
• UNICEF has helped facilitated smooth vertical cooperation between provincial, district,
communal and village stakeholders specifically in terms of establishing action plans in
alignment with targeted objectives; carrying out capacity building for service providers;
monitoring and documenting achieved results through field visits, periodic meetings,
and progress reports. Furthermore, for the sake of timely and comprehensive services
for all children, the multi-sectoral collaboration in each level of subnational government
is also maximized, reflected by the representation of different technical fields (health,
education, child protection, ...) in both IECD management boards and in IECD activities
(training, communication sessions, ...).
The significance of this coherent coordination mechanism not only lies in the effective
delivery of interventions but more importantly in the improved system that goes beyond
the programme cycle. Given the availability of such coordination mechanism,
communication flows are easily encouraged and strengthened in many directions (top-
down, bottom-up, lateral, and diagonal). While the IECD steering committees at
provincial, district, and commune levels may disband at the end of the programme, the
established communication system and network, which in this case is closely-
connected and well-functioning, will continue to be utilized for further activities.
• A number of IECD related indicators on health, education, and child protection have
been integrated into the final approved SEDPs of Dien Bien, Kon Tum, and Gia Lai for
the 2021 - 2025. Not only does this mean the impacts will continue to be closely
monitored but it is also indicative of the local governments’ growing awareness and
commitment towards child-sensitive planning.
For example, thanks to UNICEF’s advocacy efforts since 2018, such indicators as
“percentage of children under 5 who are stunted”, “number of vulnerable children
receiving social assistance at community”, and so on now become annually tracked
indicators by the local budget in 2021 and the following years in the three focus
provinces. Dien Bien stands as the most proactive in retaining the comprehensive list
of child related indicators on health, education and child protection/social assistance
into their new SEDP. While Kon Tum also expressed strong eagerness to prioritize
IECD in their SEDP during the next period, Gia Lai decided to take a prudent approach
in selecting child related indicators to be included in the 5-year plan.
• From the service provider’s point of view, when asked about self-assessment of the
ability to maintain achieved results even after the IECD programme has ended, a
majority of respondents in MDRI quantitative survey looked forward with optimism,
except for a health center representative in Gia Lai province (Error! Reference source

[…] Speaking of the local people, they are constantly reminded during training that they
are not only listening for themselves but also for their relatives, their surrounding people.
We do worry that people may forget what they are taught very soon because they are too
mindful of other businesses (agricultural production). Therefore, we gave them leaflets,
books, written materials so they can read or give to their husbands (if they don’t
understand the language). If they attend the training themselves and directly participate in
interactive games during training, I believe they can easily remember the knowledge.

3. Do capacity-building activities within the IECD programme positively affect
sustainability?
Summary response: Yes, to a certain extent. Capacity-building activities were very much
appreciated and valued by the central government, the local governments and IECD service
providers. However, limited financial resources to organize repetitive training (or follow-up
activities after training) as well as personnel transfers are among the key issues to be taken
into accounts.
• Capacity-building for teaching staff has been proven to be impactful, which further
highlights the potential sustainability of ECE interventions. During the IECD
implementation period, technical training was offered in four subjects namely (i) Supporting
children during transfer from preschool to primary school; (ii) Parenting programmes; (iii)
Social and emotional learning for children; and (iv) Early learning/ early stimulation,
including positive and responsive care. Error! Reference source not found. displayed

rate and application rate (compared to baseline) equals to higher likelihood that preschools
in project areas are able to provide services independently and intuitively without direct
intervention from UNICEF.

• When compared to the education sector, capacity building training for healthcare service
providers seemed to have more minimal effects. Despite an observable spill-over effect
(the application rate is higher than the training rate), a very small number of respondents
in the quantitative survey did attend technical training in all three IYCF key topics: (i) Early
breastfeeding; (ii) Supplementary feeding (weaning) using diverse nutrient-rich foods, and
(iii) Frequency of feeding by age (see Error! Reference source not found.). The decrease
comes from the fact that IYCF training was only provided for a limited number of healthcare
workers whereas in the year 2021, under the Covid-19’s situation, neither training is
allowed nor healthcare staff have time for participation.

[…] To be honest, the program is about to end but we have no time for many activities that

FGD with PMU in Mang Yang district, Gia Lai province.
Overall, there are several factors negatively affecting the programme’s sustainability to be
summarized below:
• Inequality remains an overarching challenge to always be redressed in parallel with any
kind of interventions, especially when considering that the three project provinces are
accommodating heterogeneous population in cultural backgrounds, socio-economic
statuses and living conditions.
• The Covid-19 pandemic is presenting many difficulties for sustainability, specifically for the
health sector as all available resources, both financial and human, are prioritizing disease
prevention. On the other hand, Covid-19 restrictions and preventive measures, if
prolonged, will also hinder beneficiaries’ access to IECD services and interfere with the
process of cross-community exchange of knowledge and lesson learnt from the model
• Limited local budget for capacity-building activities and knowledge loss due to staff
offboarding/transfer are also worth considering for better preparedness and stronger
programme sustainability.

Findings on evaluation questions
In the endline evaluation, the scalability of the programme is determined as the extent to which
the programme demonstrates its potential for future upgrade and expansion to other provinces
nationwide. To explore the likelihood of program’s scalability, some key questions of scalability
will be further explained, including:
➢ Are there prospects for further development of related interventions after the end of the
programme cycle in other provinces?
➢ Are local governments in project locations committed and simultaneously capable of
upscaling the IECD operationalization model after the programme’s completion?
In general, the scalability of the IECD programme is “Satisfactory” with the following
justification:
1. Are there prospects for further development of related interventions after the end
of programme cycle in other districts/provinces?
Summary response: Yes, there is a high likelihood of upscaling the programme’s interventions
in other districts within UNICEF-supported provinces and even in other provinces across the
country. To be specific:
• Substantial evidence for the replicability and applicability of the IECD model
consistently exists in all three project regions. For the scalability at the national scale,
most of the respondents in the qualitative study shared that they have high confidence in
the broad applicability of the IECD model but with some modifications in each locality.
117
Box 1. Evidence for IECD model replicability in Dien Bien, Kon Tum and Gia Lai
Dien Bien, by the attempt of designing UNICEF-supported activities in alignment with the Provincial
Action Programme for Children, has left a distinct mark within the scope of the child protection
component. During the four-year period of implementation, Dien Bien has formed a well-trained core
team of child protection staff who would greatly contribute as the “seed of replicability”. In fact, there
is evidence that the child protection model did scale up in other communes and districts. According
to the representative of DOLISA Dien Bien, the Blue Dragon Children’s Foundation and World Vision
have adopted a similar model of tracking, monitoring and supervision into child protection and case
management systems in their project communes/districts. They invited the core team of child
protection in UNICEF-supported regions to join workshops/training courses to disseminate their skills
and knowledge in case management and model operation. Although the number of communes
having the IECD model replicated is still modest, this somewhat proves the effectiveness of the pilot
model in child supporting work in Dien Bien.
The FGD with provincial PMU representatives in Kon Tum revealed that 42 out of 102 communes
(including 9 project communes) had deployed a similar community-based child protection system.
Among the out-of-project communes, some have maintained the system developed by UNICEF in
the previous period 2011-2016 with the province budget, while others adopted the same one from
the Plan International’s activities. Not only community-based child protection but a IECD system has
also been well developed in these communes, which incorporated the child education and healthcare
sector. In the synthesis report of overall IECD programme in 2017-2021 period, key departments in
PMU Kon Tum proposed some outstanding models to be replicated in the coming time, specifically:
For the Department of Education and Training: (i) Socio-Emotional Development for preschool
students; and (ii) Community-based Library.
For the Department of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs: (i) “Nobody is Perfect” Communication
Programme and (ii) Case management system for marginalized children.
For the Department of Health: (i) IECD clubs and (ii) Community-based management for stunting
children under 5 years old.
Gia Lai initiated the upscaling of the community-based library model in other communes. According
to the synthesis report provided by PMU Gia Lai, in 2020, all 257 schools in 17 non-program districts
established this model, of which there are 34 pre-schools. During the academic year of 2020-2021,
it was reported that 193/257 schools (equivalent to 75 per cent) have successfully implemented and
officially put the model into operation. Leaders of pilot communes/districts in Gia Lai arranged a field
trip for other communes/districts for exchanging and discussing the model’s structure. In addition, a
plan for the system upscaling across Gia Lai has been set out by the provincial DOET with the
highlight of training sessions and end-of-programme results introduction. Among non-program
districts, Pleiku City has taken the primary steps in the development of the replicability and
applicability plan of the model in locality. Noticeably, in 2020, MOLISA organized an exchange
workshop for provinces nationwide; thereby, opening up opportunities for consulting the way of IECD
Programme implementation. On this occasion, nearly 30 other districts did express their desire and
practical needs for the model enhancement. This would imply the library’s potential for further
scalability in Gia Lai.
• Enabling actors at national level have actively engaged in the programme’s
expansion nationwide. There is a strong possibility for further upscaling the IECD model
at national scale, evidenced by the fact that the People’s Committee in all 63 provinces
have ratified the Provincial Scheme on Early Childhood Development under the approval
118
of the National ECD Scheme in 2019. Particularly, from our discussion with representatives
of MOET and MOLISA, the national plan for further IECD model replication has integrated
all the UNICEF-supported activities and objectives into the annual governance plan. Even
UNICEF has put great effort in proposing and back-and-forth discussing with relevant
departments for IECD implementation at national scale over time.
• On the side of project provinces, official staffs at all levels have demonstrated their
willingness for the model upscaling to other districts and communes due to the
impressive changes that the programme has delivered. All three provinces have currently
progressed towards the summary of end-of-programme achievements and lessons learnt
drawn from the pilot model. This synthesis report is expected to serve as a practical
cornerstone for the development of Provincial Replication Plan and further revision of the
National ECD Scheme by MOLISA. However, the shortage in both financial and human
resources could become a major barrier to the IECD-related policy enforcement in the next
stage.
• However, the Covid-19 pandemic is believed to be a possible impediment to the
upscaling process of the IECD programme to some extent. Since the early of 2020
with the emergence of Covid-19 in Vietnam, many strict and restrictive measures have
been implemented by the (social distancing, lockdown, barricades, etc.). According to
some key members of PMUs at central and provincial level, Covid-19 will greatly affect the
implementation of programme activities when replicating the model on a large scale. For
example, the community meetings for parents/caregivers would be postponed in the
regions subjected to lockdown or public gathering restriction.
In addition, the provincial budget for project activities would be distributed to other epidemic
preventive tasks. However, from the PMU’s evaluation, Covid-19 pandemic, in fact, may
not have a heavy impact on the programme’s sustainability as well as the model replication
plans at all levels. In the future, the design of the programme’s activities is projected to be
flexible to adapt with the current context.
2. Are local governments in project locations committed and simultaneously capable
of upscaling the IECD operationalization model in other districts?
Summary response: Yes, to a certain extent. Evidence from both qualitative discussion and
quantitative survey has implicated strong commitment to replicating IECD operationalization
model in other districts across three project provinces.
• Beneficiaries and official staffs expressed their genuine willingness for
participation in terms of the programme’s scaling up. According to the qualitative
interview and discussion, the project participants well recognised the benefits that the
programme has brought about with regards to ECD related awareness-raising and
practices. From the perspectives of project staff in provinces and communes, they
showed their strong commitment for upscaling the programme’ achievements in the
future.
However, in the context of Covid-19 outbreak, most of the local resources would be
used with the priority of dealing with Covid-19 rather than for replicating activities.
119
“
[…] It is our “regular duty” to scale up the program’s achievements so there is no reason
for the unreadiness.
KII with the Vice Director of PMU, Kon Tum.
• There is firm recommendation from the service providers (leaders of communal
PMU, health centres and pre-school) to expand the implementation of IECD
model in other localities. The endline questionnaire designed for service providers in
project provinces asked if they would recommend a similar model in other provinces.
Remarkably, 100 percent of the respondents in all three provinces confirmed that they
definitely would promote the programme’s scalability at their best capability.

ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS,
GENDER EQUALITY, HUMAN
RIGHTS AND EQUITY ISSUES
6.1 Ethical Consideration
In an effort to follow the ethical guidelines and standards set by the UN and UNICEF as
mentioned in TOR, the research team has sought to obtain the ethical approval for research
involving human participation. The decision for undertaking the study was granted by the
Ethical Review Board (ERB) of Hanoi University of Public Health (please see Appendix 3 for
further details). The set of documents for ERB submission included: (i) Research proposal that
details the overall objectives and methodologies applied in the studies, (ii) CVs of the study’s
researchers, (iii) general information of the study provided for participants and (iv) consent
form. There are some crucial factors that the research team has taken into consideration during
the study implementation, including: participants’ benefits and harms, consent, barrier of
language, personal privacy and compensation. The procedure for applying ethical
consideration will be demonstrated in detail as below.
Informed consent
The research team encouraged the respondents’ decision to involve in the study on a voluntary
basis. There is no explicit or implicit risk so that the potential respondents can be fully informed
of their roles. Prior to the interview, enumerators will inform potential participants to read and
sign a consent form, which provides the information about (i) evaluation’s objectives, (ii)
implementing agent, (iii) duration of the study, (iv) participants’ roles, (v) potential benefits and
risks arising from their involvement in the study, (vi) personal information privacy and (vii)
emergency contact information. In addition, the respondents will be also informed and ensured
about the confidentiality of data information and all information and allow them to withdraw
from answering the question whenever they feel uncomfortable to respond. In some cases
where the interviewees cannot speak Vietnamese fluently, the enumerator asked a local
person to interpret. To ensure personal privacy, local interpreters were required to commit to
confidential agreement as regulated by MDRI. Particularly, in case of interviewing children, the
permission will be sought from both the primary caregiver as well children themselves. It will
be operationalized by the provision of a written consent form to be signed by representatives
or heads of households or primary caregivers.
Anonymity
The anonymity of the participants maintains the safeguard in both quantitative (household and
service provider survey) and qualitative study (KIIs and FGDs). Prior to the interviews, they will
be informed that their answers are for research purposes without revealing their identities to
external parties. The research team will be responsible for the confidentiality of participants’
information sharing during the interview. The interview data then will be saved on password-
protected computers and be encrypted for confidential protection during the process of data
clearance and processing. This means that the names and other identifying information of
study participants will not be stored securely and safely from unauthorized access.
121
Privacy
The research team took the responsibility to preserve the privacy of participants during the
data collection process. We also took necessary measures with an attempt to ensure that the
participants were not vulnerable or controlled by other individuals, particularly in sensitive
contexts. For the FGD, the discussion will be implemented without the presence of their
superiors or leaders in the village or commune. This could encourage an open and comfortable
environment for participants in opinion-sharing and avoid the reluctance in their response to
the evaluation questions related to the IECD programme. In addition, the FGDs will be held
separately for each gender group, in order to avoid the dominance of males to females in ethnic
minority culture. Other pictures and audio materials throughout the data collection process
were taken upon the participants’ agreement and will be disclosed to external parties.
Respect for participants
The research team always demonstrated our respect to the participants and their answers
given during the interview without any judgement or opinion expression. All their perspectives
were well-recorded and taken into consideration in the evaluation process. Besides, we also
took cultural sensitivity as a crucial dimension to be concerned when implementing the
research with EM people. Specifically, when conducting the interview, the research team
attempted to build an inclusive environment for all to equally share their opinions, in order to
diminish the inferiority and avoid the domination arising during the discussion. Being aware of
the different identity of each ethnic minority group, the research team respected all the
distinctions in their belief, customs and practices.
Harms and/or benefits realized
The study has minimal risks, which may be from the stress generated by the tension throughout
the interview. In order to minimize participants’ pressure from answering the questions (related
to IECD/ECD programmes, their usual practice of parenting, caring children, service providers
of education and health in the community), they were advised to answer as best as they can
and if they do not want to answer one or more of the questions, they can choose not to answer
them. Moreover, the research team paid as much effort as possible to mitigate any potential
risk and to ensure none of researchers or enumerators in the fieldwork are exposed to
unacceptable lives of risk. Prior to the fieldwork, the research team prepared the insurance for
all staff and enumerators to deal with the potential risks associated with travel and work in the
fieldwork, particularly with the emergence of Covid-19 in project areas.
Regarding the benefits, there are no direct benefits to the respondents as a research subject
other than compensation for their time. However, the results obtained from this study may be
useful for UNICEF Viet Nam in understanding the context of project provinces as well as
prepare for their advocacy of the IECD model at national level.
Compensation
The respondents will receive a reasonable compensation for their time to participate in the
study, based on the research team’s previous experience from baseline assessment and local
consultation about payment. Additionally, the research team’s compensation will not distort
potential participants’ decision to take part in the study or their responses given. Due to the
fact that, the compensation will be provided after the interview or FGD is completed.

6.2 Human rights, child rights, gender and equity
6.2.1. Human rights and child rights-based approaches
The design of the IECD programme is coherent with Human Rights Based Approaches (HRBA)
to programming. The programme is designed to enable concerned duty bearers and right
holders to fulfil rights to survival and development of the child, employing an integration
approach as the success strategy to help children have better a start and reach their full
potential.
To be specific, IECD interventions in three thematic areas are considered to fulfil some basic
human rights that have been recognised by law, including the rights to healthcare, the rights
to have access to basic social services, and the rights to education.
The Programme is also one of the vehicles that UNICEF Viet Nam and the Government of Viet
Nam utilised to promote children’s rights, i.e. children’s access to basic services in a holistic
manner and opportunities to reach their full potential. This approach is appropriate since Viet
Nam was the first country in Asia and the second country in the world ratifying the United
Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. In addition, Viet Nam has also actively
implemented the Declaration issued by the World Summit for “Child Survival, Protection and
Development” and the Declaration adopted by the UN General Assembly, “A World Fit For
Children”.
Last but not least, a facet that demonstrates the Programme’s alignment with HRBA is through
the addressment of the needs of duty-bearers when it comes to capacities. The duty bearers
at national and local level have been properly trained and empowered to educate and sensitise
their communities (including the right holders) of their responsibilities and entitlements.
6.2.2 Equity
The IECD programme’s coherence with equity principles is highlighted in various aspects. One
of them is the priority in the selection of specially disadvantaged communes. Three selected
provinces represents the lowest levels of development across spectrum development
indicators related to children such as nutrition, access to safe water and hygienic latrines.
The programme interventions such as improving parents’ knowledge, skills and practices in
childcare or health care for pregnant women have brought benefits to its target population,
regardless of their gender, ethnicity and background. Ethnic minorities were greatly involved
in programme implementation to ensure their participation and voice. For example, in many
communication sessions, information was explained in ethnic languages by the local
collaborators.
6.2.3. Gender issues
In the baseline report, we applied the Women’s Empowerment Framework by Longwe to look
at gender issues in the IECD programme. This framework identifies what women’s equality
and empowerment would mean in practice, hence is useful in determining to what extent a
development intervention supports greater empowerment, based on the concept of five levels
of equality as shown in Figure 75. Our analysis showed that the emphasis of the programme
was at three levels, from Access to Participation: increasing women’s access to healthcare
services, their self-confidence and capacity in childcare, along with their participation in
123
decision-making processes. In the endline, we examined gender issues again through these
aspects to understand how the programme’s emphasis on gender had worked out.

Access
As indicated previously in the endline assessment’s findings, the IECD Programme contributed
to the improvement in female beneficiaries’ welfare, specifically their access to maternal
healthcare services. Firstly, the ICED programme was found to generate a number of positive
impacts on the antenatal care coverage in general in the project areas. The endline results
indicate a 17 percentage point increase in the percentage of pregnant women receiving
supplementation, compared to baseline (Indicator 6). In terms maternal health check-up,
notably, in Dien Bien and Kon Tum province, the endline rates of women aged 15-49 with a
live birth in the last 2 years who were attended at least four times by health care providers
grew larger by 9% and 11% respectively (Indicator 24). The proportion of women who attended
at least one antenatal visit also increased from 80% to 84% after three years of the programme.
There has also been a decrease in the percentage of women with no prenatal check-up
throughout the last pregnancy from 20% at baseline to 16% at endline. Secondly, in terms of
birth delivery, the proportion of women giving birth at a health facility has increased by 7,3
percentage points after the programme’s interventions (Indicator 25). In addition, the
percentage of women who were attended by skilled health personnel during labour increased
from 55.2% to 61.3%, while only 1% went through a delivery without any assistance. These
indicators clearly manifested the programme’s efforts in tackling the gender issue of women’s
access to maternal healthcare services in rural areas.
Conscientisation
At the conscientisation level, we look at the programme’s focus and impacts on the awareness
of rights, gendered roles, and divisions of labour, equality. As pointed out in the baseline report,
the IECD Programme focuses on the engagement of both parents into child care and
development to raise the beneficiaries’ awareness of gendered roles. The programme’s
124
interventions encouraged the participation of not only mothers but also fathers in antenatal
care, and in child-rearing through the parenting classes.
However, as evident from the informants’ sharing during the programme evaluation, the
participation of fathers in the parenting classes was still much lower than mothers, which
reinforced the gendered roles of women as the sole responsible person in taking care of
children aged 0-8, including feeding, protecting, and educating them. Two main reasons were
found to be the cause of fathers’ low participation in the programme’s training activities. Firstly,
gendered roles and the divisions of labour, which assigned women with child-rearing and men
with income-earning roles, were still deeply ingrained in the mind-sets of the local people. A
commune leader in Muong Mun, Dien Bien shared that in their commune, the proportion of
mothers in IECD training sessions was normally about 70%, and the main reason for this
gender imbalance was that the fathers would shy from these activities because they saw this
as the mothers’ business, not theirs. This perception regarding gendered roles was also found
in Kon Tum, where fathers participating in a FGD admitted that it was mostly the mothers who
attended the IECD clubs. Even when the mothers shared what they learnt from the training,
the fathers would not pay too much attention since they perceived child-rearing to be mostly
the mothers’ responsibilities. This suggested changing the deep-rooted mindset of the local
people on the exclusive role of women in child-rearing is a difficult task that could take a long
time to have an impact. Thus, it would require more focused interventions to target this issue.
Secondly, the fact that the training classes for parents were organised during daytime in some
localities also discouraged fathers’ participation. Some KIIs and FGDs in Dien Bien and Kon
Tum revealed that since the fathers often had to go to work during daytime, they could not
attend the parenting club even if they wanted to. Thus, it was recommended by the informants
that these sessions should be organised in the evening so that fathers could also attend.
Participation
As analysed in the baseline report, the IECD programme’s attention to increasing women’s
participation was evident in its engagement of the Women Unions in the implementation of the
programme’s activities from the beginning. Specifically, the Women Unions was a member of
the project management group, managed the parenting club activities, and coordinated with
other focal points. The Women Unions’ active participation provided a chance for local women
to share their daily issues about family planning or reproductive health.
However, although the women’s participation in the IECD programme was a commendable
achievement and could encourage women to participate in other community issues, in some
surveyed localities, women’s participation in the local affairs was still low. As shared in an
FGD with mothers in Kon Tum, the women rarely took part in the village’s meeting, except for
when the discussion concerned childcare. This again highlighted the perception of women as
the sole responsible person for childcare, as well as undermined the women’s role in the
community.
“
We have monthly meetings organised by the village head, where he invites community
members to come to talk. If it is related to childcare, then the mothers would go, if not then
the husbands would go.

IMPACTS OF COVID-19 ON THE
PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION
7.1. Impacts on the achievement of results in key
programme components
Healthcare component (Child health and Maternal health)
The emergence of Covid-19 pandemic has put intense pressure on the healthcare service
providers’ workloads. Handling with tasks of Covid-19 control and preventive measures has
become the centre of attention within the provincial healthcare system, taking most of the
staffs’ working time. This, therefore, induced an interruption in the periodic medical check-ups
for children and pregnant women. The group discussion with Gia Lai PMUs recognised current
situation that the outburst of Covid-19 across local areas hindered the undertaking of acute
malnutrition management as planned. More specially, under the normal context, a core team
of communal healthcare staffs used to take charge of measuring children’s heights and weights
for further assessment of their stunting rate, by which the staffs would give advice to caregivers
on nutritional supplements to children. Moreover, according to communal staffs, cases of local
parents having been in quarantine camp for 2 weeks would also be a contributing factor to the
malnutrition percentage in 3 provinces since they could not take care of their children during
this period. To investigate how the pandemic affects the socio-economic conditions among
households, the endline survey asked if the household’s earnings changed and if they worried
about not having enough food to eat amid the Covid-19 outbreak. The results showed that half
of surveyed households have suffered from the reduction in their total income, with almost
none of households claimed to have their earnings increased ever since the pandemic arrival
in Vietnam. Food security is currently of major concern to majority of households in surveyed
areas, recorded by 73.67 per cent of those expressed their anxiety about food insufficiency in
the future. Another impact of Covid-19 pandemic on the healthcare component in project areas
should refer to the fact that no expanded IYCF training has been conducted for health workers
at the village level, leading to the decrease in the number of IYCF counselling-qualified health
workers (as mentioned in Indicator 11).
“
[…] Covid-19 has lots of effects on not only communications campaign but also the
beneficiaries’ economic situation. The price of foodstuffs has been rising, while parents has
turned to be unemployed for a long time, having not enough money to buy food to maintain
dietary portion for their children as guidance.
FGD with PMU representatives in Tuan Giao district, Dien Bien.
126
“
Since 2019, the Covid-19 pandemic put severe impact on our household’s economic
situation and mental health. Our total earning, in general, has limited in value, while our
mental state has been deteriorated from every aspect.
FGD with male caregivers in Dien Bien.
Even though most of the indicators reflecting the healthcare services for mothers achieved
positive improvement in terms of nutritional supplementation for pregnant women, child
delivery and prenatal care check-ups, the pandemic still has posed some potential challenges
to maternal health development in project areas. From the observations of communal health
centre leader, the percentage of local women giving birth or having prenatal examination at
health facility had a tendency to decrease in the year 2021 due to their fear of infection, thus
making them feel more reluctant when getting access to healthcare system.
“
When the pandemic happened, people seemed to be reluctant to take prenatal check-ups or
give birth at health facility. They only came to health centre when things became really
urgent.
FGD with PMU representatives in Dien Bien.
Education component
Among the key components within the scope of IECD Programme, the development of some
indicators in education sector faced up with significant challenges presented by the outbreak
of Covid-19. At the time of conducting qualitative interview with PMUs at all levels (from
provincial to communal level), it was reported that only students from primary schools and
above could have a chance to study in face-to-face mode, while those attending kindergarten
or nurseries had to stay at home with their caregivers. This could be primary explanation for
the lower rate of literacy-numeracy learning than other domains among children aged 36-59
months, considering the school closure and limited school attendance during Covid-19 period
(refer to Indicator 20). In addition, staying only at home in a long time would cause some
potential mental and communication-related issues to children under 6 years old, according to
most of representatives working in education sector. For example, without playing with their
peers, children may be less likely to open their hearts or feel confident to express their thoughts
or feelings. Their study in a short term could be distracted due to the lack of strict supervision
from their teachers or unstable network connection. On the side of the caregivers, it seems
that they merely do not spend much time playing or teaching their children, partly because they
are busy working in the field all daytime.
127
“
In the normal context, when attending schools, children have a chance to participate in many
activities including sports event, school clubs, etc, but all these activities have been
cancelled under the impact of Covid-19 across the province.
FGD with PMU representatives in Dien Bien.
However, the Department of Education in all three UNICEF-supported provinces has taken
great efforts to propose teaching plans to adapt with the “new normal” situation, applying in
different ways based on the pandemic level. A specific teaching plan was mentioned by the
principal of kindergarten in Kon Tum that:
• At the first-level pandemic: Conduct face-to-face learning mode
• At the second-level pandemic: For children aged 5 years old, divide class into small
groups of students and no lunch will be conducted at school. For those below 5, the
teachers will design syllabus as guidance for parents to teach their children at home
• At the third or fourth-level pandemic: Conduct self-study at home for children with
support from teachers via video call
Despite of all the efforts to prepare for adaptation plan, the infrastructure and household socio-
economic level still cannot meet the requirements for remote learning, presenting huge
challenges to the educational quality. Given that the programme has undertaken in one of the
most extremely difficult regions, a large amount of local people cannot have access to mobile
phone or internet, so that online learning is quite unfamiliar with households in these provinces.
The application of teaching method and even extracurricular activities via online platform
seems to be far from practical scenario.
“
Covid-19 pandemic put negative influence on the quality in education sector. Dien Bien is a
mountainous region and the infrastructure here still cannot meet the requirement for online
learning. Statistically, up to 75% of the student in Dien Bien reported to be unable to join
online learning due to not only the under-qualified infrastructure system but also the shortage
of necessary devices. Besides, their study would be severely affected by the unstable
internet connection or external distractions.
FGD with PMU representatives in Dien Bien.
Child protection component
When looking at the performance of child protection component in project regions, the
occurrence of Covid-19 since 2020 appears not to bring up any serious matters to its
improvement, but difficulties to providing beneficiaries with child protection services have been
fully aware by the staffs at all levels. The restrictive measures, including the ban of public
gathering, would constitute impediment to organising communications activities or trainings for
128
beneficiary caregivers. The process of approaching and making lists of vulnerable children
such as those suffering from violence, abuse or neglect amid Covid-19 pandemic could not be
provided timely as a result of limited opportunity to visit household in person, which is
considered to be necessary when providing children-related interventions, particularly in the
disadvantaged regions. This helps gather the information of disadvantaged children from
various sources (e.g. parents/ caregivers, relatives or neighbours), directly storing data in the
form of media or photos for the completion of case management profiles. The widespread of
Covid-19 pandemic since 2020, in fact, restricted case managers from visiting beneficiary
households, and also became the primary reason behind the local residents’ hesitancy to
report the case-in-need promptly.
“
The programme has only five years of implementation, but it takes two years of operation
under the Covid-19’s impact. This put a negative impact on the provision of child protection
service for children, which requires meeting children in person for information collection.
Currently we only get information through indirect sources, but most of the time this method
would bring up only imprecise information. From my own experiences, this limitation could
lead to the decrease of approximately 60 to 70 per cent in the quality of case management.
FGD with PMU representatives in Mang Yang district, Gia Lai.
From the initial design of qualitative tool, the research team desired to explore if there are any
unexpected consequences arising from Covid-19’s impacts to the rate of children suffering
from violence, abuse or neglect. Nearly none of participating communes and districts in
qualitative study recorded any significant changes in this figure, except for the case confirmed
by child protection staff in Mang Yang district (Gia Lai). The staff highlighted the fact that during
5 years of working, no case of child abuse has been reported from communal level but the
case of two children as victims of domestic violence occurred in 2021. In this case, the act of
violent was perpetrated by their drunk fathers, who recently became unemployed as a result
of Covid-19 pandemic.
7.2. Impacts on the programme implementation
Since the early of 2020, Vietnam has witnessed the widespread of Covid-19 pandemic at
national scale in an unpredictable way. A package of containment measures has been
implemented to mitigate the adverse impacts of Covid-19, one of which includes the restriction
of travel and public gatherings. This situation did bring about many challenges in the
implementation of the IECD programme, especially communication activities that require a
large group of about 20-30 caregivers to participate. With the social distancing order being
imposed, the organisation of group communication activities has been cancelled. Home visit
to provide multi-micronutrient package or vulnerable children counselling and prenatal check-
ups has experienced the interruption in frequency due to the concern about health safety of
local residents. Furthermore, the UNICEF staffs seem to have struggle arranging monitoring
and fieldtrip to project locations.
129
Above all, the programme did manage to make some necessary adjustments during the
implementation period as an adaptation plan in the context of Covid-19 pandemic. To be
specific, instead of organising communication activities in large groups of nearly 30 people,
some project communes came up with the idea of subdividing into smaller groups of 5-7
participants and integrating the parenting knowledge for caregivers when they brought their
children to health centres for periodic immunisation. Meanwhile, other communes switched to
indirect communication through loudspeakers and written materials or provided telephone
counselling for children-in-need. Besides, a core team of local collaborators in child protection
and key staffs in healthcare and education based in village was established to take the
supporting role even in case of lockdowns. Although all the adjustments above demonstrated
a certain level of flexibility to adapt with the contextual changes, the effectiveness of
communication activities still did not satisfy the programme’s expectation as under normal
condition due to the uncontrollability in the number of people reached and insufficiency of key
messages delivered.
With great effort to implement remote monitoring, most of the monitoring and coordination
activities have been switched from offline to online. In response with the environmental
changes, UNICEF invested in digital equipment for PMU and provincial partners to conduct
online meetings/training so that the frequent operational activities were not interrupted
abruptly. In fact, according to PMUs in three provinces, the means of communication and
coordination between stakeholders at different levels have currently been taken via common
only platforms, such as Zalo, Facebook or Zoom Meeting. At the time of endline survey, almost
all communes conducted brief meetings on regular basis and others reported to change their
mode of meeting to online recently. However, communal staffs claimed that they still have to
confront with many difficulties in supporting service provision and staying in contact with
beneficiaries, particularly in remote areas without the cell phone coverage.

LIMITATIONS
Almost every challenge previously faced in the baseline assessment has been well avoided by
the research team thanks to thorough fieldwork preparation. However, the COVID-19
pandemic affected how the quantitative and qualitative fieldwork took place. This section
outlines the challenges posed by the pandemic and how the research team tackled them.
8.1 Quantitative Study
Enumerator training
In following the national regulations on Covid-19 prevention and for the safety of the research
team and survey team, there were two major challenges faced by MDRI with regards to
enumerator recruitment and enumerator training. First, due to the tightened traveling
restrictions imposed on external people, 100% of enumerators employed in the endline
survey were local residents of the three project provinces. Therefore, the data collector team
includes both experienced enumerators selected from MDRI’s network in tandem with
beginners who had never conducted household surveys first-hand. To equip these newcomers
with adequate interviewing skills and attitudes, our research team managed to group them with
highly competent enumerators who either participated in the baseline survey or possessed
similar experiences.
Second, also due to social distancing rules, the training mode was forced to switch to
online (through Zoom), which caused both the trainers and the trainees many difficulties.
Besides the arising technical issues related to unstable Internet connections during training,
the lack of face-to-face interactions when practicing/lecturing was truly a major shortcoming
that disrupted participants’ concentration and comprehension. In order to mitigate the
anticipated limitations of virtual training, MDRI recorded every training session and uploaded
all materials used in class (presentation slides, documents, exercises, videos, etc.) in a shared
folder immediately after each day. We also created a Q&A thread (through GG sheet) so
everyone could pose their questions pre-, during, and after the sessions. Last but not least, in-
class practices, homework and tests were made the most use to track trainees’ understanding
of delivered contents. However, despite the mentioned efforts, it is important to acknowledge
that the quality of online training could not be compared with an interactive, face-to-face one;
putting heavier load on the role of monitoring and supervising enumerators’ survey
performance.
Fieldwork survey area
Shortly before the beginning of the quantitative fieldwork, there were newly emerged Covid
cases in K’Bang district of Gia Lai province. This leads to the local authority’s decision to
suspend the entire evaluation activities in the locality. Upon multiple discussions with all
stakeholders, it was mutually agreed that the situation is beyond UNICEF and MDRI control,
and therefore K’Bang district was excluded from the endline assessment, which resulted in the
cut down of the sample size from 27 communes (1080 households) to 24 communes (960
households)
131
Statistically, this omission did not have a major impact on the overall evaluation, but
may have some adverse impacts on the performance of Gia Lai province in some
specific indicators that are linked to characteristics of K’Bang area.
Fieldwork supervision
Due to Covid-19 preventive measures, the research team was deprived of travelling to the
survey area for fieldwork supervision. Therefore, it is a necessity that research team strengthen
other methods of quality control, specifically audio supervision and phone back-checking. In
sum, the research team listened to 10% of the total number of household responses
(97/960) through audio supervision and called back 30 survey respondents for the sake
of data quality control.
8.2 Qualitative Study
The pandemic also made the research team conduct 27 KIIs and 12 FGDs virtually. The team
understood that online KIIs and FGDs have certain disadvantages, especially when
involving grass-root levels (parents/primary caregivers). For example, some participants
may feel camera-shy, thus not being as much comfortable and present as in a person-to-
person situation. Also, because person-to-person interactions such as eye contact or body
language or the use of visual aids is limited, some activities for FGDs with lay people were
omitted – resource map, flow diagram, transect walk. The research team’s not being able to
conduct qualitative fieldwork also hinders our opportunity to gain practical observations and
insightful look into the life of beneficiaries, partially affecting the comprehensiveness of this
assessment. Last but not least, due to the physical and technical constraints of online FGD,
the number of participants in each FGD was limited at 3-5 (instead of 6-8 people).
Despite those obstacles, the team still tried our best to successfully finish the qualitative study
both in terms of quantity and quality, with special thanks to the cooperation and coordination
of programme personnel at all levels (province, district, commune, and village).

CONCLUSION, LESSONS
LEARNT AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
The evaluation adduced conclusive and convincing evidence that the IECD programme
implemented in Dien Bien, Kon Tum, and Gia Lai has been a successful project in terms of
both achieved results and worthwhile lessons for national scale up.
Achievement of results
Quantitatively, the Programme has been effective: most indicators at endline showed
progressive improvement compared to its benchmark values in all thematic areas. First
and foremost, both maternal health and child health have greatly improved in its status, with
the former witnessing a high level of increase in its related indicators and the latter seeing a
considerable reduction in stunting rate in combination with an improvement in age-appropriate
nutrition. Second, with regards to education, capacity-building for educators at both national
and provincial levels resulted in the broad adoption of tools and teaching methods that foster
responsive care and social – emotional learning for children, raising the overall awareness of
the significance of the early years to one’s lifelong development. Besides, some good models
like Growing with music and Community based child friendly libraries have been documented
and endorsed for provincial widespread implementation. Third, in the area of child protection,
the system has been enhanced and fortified in comparison to prior years, comprising of staff
who have been professionally trained and can perform case management. Moreover, both
awareness and practice of non-violent child discipline has experienced an increase from
baseline, indicating a gradual shift toward responsive parenting. On the other hand, there were
some areas that did not show as impressive performance as the others at the time of the
endline evaluation, namely IYCF or early stimulation. The total time of interventions affected
by Covid-19 could be a factor to consider in this case. During 39 months of programme
implementation, only 27 months happened under normal conditions. For example, in the year
2021 alone, no expanded IYCF training was conducted for village health workers as planned,
due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Speaking specifically of province partners, apart from the indicators that increased from
baseline in all three provinces and/or did not have a major gap across provinces (ie: WASH,
child awareness, child development), it is interesting yet also surprising at the same time
to see that each province demonstrated its own strength in some particular areas. For
instance, Dien Bien, even though lagging behind in most indicators, still rose high and
surpassed the other two provinces in a number of key indicators including non-violent child
discipline practices and IECD perception. Kon Tum had quite a steady performance overall,
yet most notably in maternal health, early stimulation and responsive care. Gia Lai’s case is
rather unpredictable in the sense that this province did not follow the same upward/downward
trend as the other two in many areas. For example, although there has been a decrease in the
number of healthcare workers who are able to perform IYCF (Indicator 11) or in the number of
children receiving age-appropriate nutrition and early stimulation/learning from parents
134
(Indicator 18) in both Dien Bien and Kon Tum, the reverse happened in Gia Lai. This
observation should indicate that it is important to understand and study the potential of each
province so that we could share not just the mere result numbers but also the unique
experience and lessons learnt from each other.
Enabling environment
The IECD programme has played a valuable role in capacity building for the local actors
as well as fostering cross-sectoral coordination mechanism, which clearly reflects a
betterment in the provision of comprehensive childcare and child development services. For
example, child protection officers who can perform all the steps in case management have
doubled in number after three years in the three supported provinces. 22 out of 27 preschools
in the three projects provinces (equivalent to more than 80%) are capable of providing all four
early learning/stimulation services. Interdisciplinary engagement is present in the programme
management board and in many activities – group communication, consultative meetings,
holistic parenting clubs, and so on. More importantly, participants in the qualitative KIIs and
FGDs including government representatives, service providers, and parents/primary
caregivers exhibited a great level of support towards early childhood development and
improving early-years nurturing care system for children.
There has been continuing improvement in the access and quality of IECD services thanks to
the strong political will and determination of the local governments, service providers, and
programme collaborators in all three project provinces. To be more specific, the number of
communes having functioning IECD services and the proportion of ECD centres providing
integrated ECD services has clearly increased since the baseline. The child protection systems
from provincial to grass-root level have also been established and reinforced in accordance
with the national standards.
In addition, although signs of inequality in ethnicity, educational attainment, and living
standards still persist across almost all indicators, the “integrated” system of early
childhood development initiated and strengthened throughout the past four years does
help gradually narrow the gaps between the privileged and the underprivileged,
evidenced by the outperforming of disadvantaged groups in indicators related to child
development (Indicator 20), early breastfeeding (Indicator 21), skilled birth attendance
(Indicator 23), among others.
On efficiency
From the project implementation perspective, financial resources were utilized
efficiently, resulting in the achievement of most important objectives. In details, three
provinces managed to achieve improvement in at least two thirds of the quantitative indicators
within the established timeframes and costs.
On sustainability & scalability
Moving forward, it is highly likely that the results and benefits brought about by programme-
related interventions are maintained for an extended period of time after the end of the
programme’s cycle. A number of IECD-related indicators on health, education, and child
protection have been integrated into the final approved SEDPs of Dien Bien, Kon Tum, and
Gia Lai for the 2021 – 2025 period. Another key factor contributing to programme’s
sustainability is the fact that a great amount of interventions focuses on capacity building at
135
both national and subnational levels, which creates a high degree of community ownership
and participation. There is also concrete evidence that certain core elements of the IECD
programme have been replicated and scaled up in non-programme areas. Examples include
the replication of case management systems for child protection in Dien Bien or the widespread
development of the community-based library friendly to children in Gia Lai, among others.
Lessons learnt
Following the key success and the positive results, unresolved challenges and critical lessons
learnt deserve special attention.
First, despite the improvement in many indicators, it was not enough to reach the endline
target, many of which were set at 100%. Therefore, when up-scaled nationwide, the objectives
must be set to be extremely sharp, focus, and highly practical. The design of action plans
needs to carefully consider financial factors. Clear communication about budget/costing should
be made early to avoid modifications of the targets for being overly ambitious as well as to
make sure all parties are stayed on track.
Second, human resources must be further leveraged. Despite a strengthened system of child
protection compared to baseline, the popularity of child protection officers among children
themselves does not seem to have improved much. Furthermore, the matter of how to sustain
the knowledge and skills acquired in UNICEF-supported training courses irrespective of
changes in the personnel apparatus also needs to be well thought out.
Last but not least, the importance of the local languages cannot be overemphasized. Even
though the percentage of people who can speak/read Vietnamese is high in most communes,
it does not mean the level of comprehension can be as high. Many ethnic minorities can only
understand a few simple words in Vietnamese if spoken slowly, thus their ability to absorb
information in their non-native language is very limited.
Recommendations
The evaluation team has compiled the following recommendations based on evaluation
findings and conclusions. The recommendations are presented separately for each type of
stakeholders, considering their roles, interests and capacity to strengthen systems for
improved governance. However, the shared objectives between all parties involved are to
deepen the partnership, expand funding and other support, where possible, and otherwise
protect the resources provided.

Technology can be further leveraged in order to generate more widespread impacts. It
would be strategic to make good use of technology in order to eliminate geographical
barriers to people living in remote and isolated areas, such as various local social
media channels (zalo, viber, facebook etc.) and other social media devices could be
used for disseminating IECD messages.
